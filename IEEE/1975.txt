        "Skew-symmetric sequences of(2n + 1)terms,a_0,a_1,\\cdots,a_{2n}, are described for which the \"merit factor\" \\begin{equation} F_h = \\frac{\\biggl[\\sum_{i=0}^{2n} \\mid a_i \\mid \\biggr] ^2}{ 2 \\sum_{k=1}^{2n} \\biggl[ \\sum_{i=0}^{2n-k} \\text{sign} (a_i) \\cdot a_{i+k} \\biggl] ^2} \\end{equation} is unusually high."
"Self-reciprocal polynomials (SRP's) are used to generate reversible codes with a read backward property. We characterize all the irreducible SRP's of a given degreer. Furthermore, a method of obtaining a maximal exponent SRP is presented. A short table lists the maximal exponents of SRP's of degree up tor = 34."
"Three optimality criteria for convolutional codes are considered in this correspondence: namely, free distance, minimum distance, and distance profile. Here we report the results of computer searches for rate one-half binary convolutional codes that are \"robustly optimal\" in the sense of being optimal for one criterion and optimal or near-optimal for the other two criteria. Comparisons with previously known codes are made. The results of a computer simulation are reported to show the importance of the distance profile to computational performance with sequential decoding."
"A new class of group binoid single-error-correcting codes is given. The codes are nonbinary group codes over the additive group of integers moduloq."
"We define a symmetric modular source to be a source-user pair consisting of an equiprobable discrete memoryless source together with a modular context-dependent fidelity criterion. For this source-user pair we establish the existence of block codes of fixed rateRgreater thanR(D)with average distortion that decreases towardsDat a doubly exponential rate in block length."
"We consider a class of matrix signal processes that are received in the presence of multiplicative observation noise. By examining the differential version of the observation, we are able to derive finite-dimensional optimal detection-estimation equations that involve a linear filter with gain computed on-line using the incoming observations. An example involving the detection of an actuator failure on a rotating rigid body is considered."
"Several recent articles [1]-[3] have discussed the use of Lagrange polynomials for band-limited signal estimation. We find error bounds when using Lagrange polynomials for interpolation and extrapolation of finite-power band-limited signals if a finite number of regularly spaced noisy samples are used."
"Davisson [131, [141 has considered the problem of determining the \"order\" of the signal from noisy data. Although interesting theoretically, his result is difficult to use in practice. In this correspondence, we exploit one well-known fact concerning autoregressive (AR) signals plus white noise, and using Akaike's information criterion [15], [17], we have developed one efficient procedure for determining the order of the AR signal from noisy data. The procedure is illustrated numerically using both artificially generated and real data. The connection between the preceding problem and the classical statistical problem of factor analysis is discussed."
"The covariance matrix of the Fourier coefficients ofN- sampled stationary random signals is studied. Three theorems are established. 1) If the covariance sequence is summable, the magnitude of every off-diagonal covariance element converges to zero asN \\rightarrow \\infty. 2) If the covariance sequence is only square summable, the magnitude of the covariance elements sufficiently far from the diagonal converges to zero asN \\rightarrow \\infty. 3) If the covariance sequence is square summable, the weak norm of the matrix containing only the off-diagonal elements converges to zero asN \\rightarrow \\infty. The rates of convergence are also determined when the covariance sequence satisfies additional conditions."
"An upper bound is established for the magnitude of the truncation error incurred when a real-valued finite energy signal that is bandlimited to-\\pi r \\leq \\omega \\leq \\pi r, 0 < r < 1, is approximated by2N + 1terms from its Shannon sampling series expansion with the samples taken at the integer points. The derived bound is an improvement on known results."
 "A model of a linguistic information source is proposed as a grammar that generates a language over some finite alphabet. It is pointed out that grammatical sentences generated by the source grammar contain intrinsic \"redundancy\" that can be exploited for error-corrections. Symbols occurring in the sentences are composed according to some syntactic rules determined by the source grammar, and hence are different in nature from the lexicographical source symbols assumed in information theory and algebraic coding theory. Almost all programming languages and some simple natural languages can be described by the linguistic source model proposed in this paper. In order to combat excessive errors for very noisy channels, a conventional encoding-decoding scheme that does not utilize the source structure is introduced into the communication system. Decoded strings coming out of the lexicographical decoder may not be grammatical, which indicates that some uncorrected errors still remain in the individual sentences and will be reprocessed by a syntactic decoder that converts ungrammatical strings into legal sentences of the source language by the maximum-likelihood criterion. Thus more errors in the strings coming out of the noisy channel can be corrected by the syntactic decoder using syntactic analysis than the !exicographical decoder is capable of correcting or even of detecting. To design the syntactic decoder we use parsing techniques from the study of compilers and formal languages."
"A class of nonparametric detectors is formulated for dependent input sequences of sampled data. Detectors in this class are nonadaptive modifications of standard nonparametric detectors designed for independent inputs and operate on multivariate samples derived by grouping the dependent univariate input samples. These groups are transformed to single variables and processed according to the corresponding standard nonparametric detection scheme. Performance analysis is initially based on assumptions implying independence of the multivariate samples, and results are then shown to remain valid under weaker conditions. Two modified one-channel detectors are analyzed to illustrate the improved performance achieved over corresponding standard non-parametric detectors."
"A disadvantage of the kernel estimate of a probability density is that the degree of smoothing about the observation points is chosen without regard to the data. A modification of the kernel estimate is proposed that allows the data to play a role in this smoothing and, at the same time, retains the desirable features of the kernel estimate."
"A code is implicitly constructed' from a lattice and its Dirichlet regions and, for Gaussian noise, the worst error probability of any code point is upperbounded in closed form by a chi-square distribution. The bound shows that fairly efficient codes can be obtained, particularly, at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) the bound approaches asymptotically the error bound of an optimal code. The derivation is by a promising new method in which the Minkowski-H!awka theorem of the geometry of numbers is used in place of the we!l-known random coding arguments."
"The fixed-lag smoothing of random telegraph type signals is studied. The smoothers are derived by first obtaining fixed-point smoothing equations and then using a time discretization. Simulation results are described that verify the qualitative carry-over of known results for the linear-Gaussian problem: the greater the lag, the greater the improvement; beyond a certain lag, no further improvement is obtained by the increase of lag; and the higher the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the greater is the improvement over filtering obtained through the use of smoothing. Smoothing errors of one-half the corresponding filtering error are demonstrated."
"For a nondecreasing distortion characteristic\\phi(\\cdot)and a given signalx(\\cdot), the \"cross correlation\" function defined byR_{\\phi} (\\tau) \\triangleq \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\phi[x(t)]x(t - \\tau) dtis shown to satisfy the inequalityR_{\\phi}(\\tau) \\leq R_{\\phi}(0), for all\\tau, generalizing an earlier result of Richardson that required\\phi(\\cdot)to be continuous and strictly increasing. The methods of the paper also show that, under weak conditions, \\begin{equation} R_{\\phi,\\psi}(\\tau) \\triangleq \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\phi[x(t)]\\psi[x(t - \\tau)] dt \\leq R_{\\phi,\\psi}(0) \\end{equation} when\\psiis strictly increasing and\\phiis nondecreasing. In the case of hounded signals (e.g., periodic functions), the appropriate cross correlation function is \\begin{equation} \\mathcal{R}_{\\phi,\\psi}(\\tau} \\triangleq \\lim_{T \\rightarrow \\infty} (2T)^{-l} \\int_{-T}^T \\phi[x(t)]\\psi[x(t - \\tau)] dt. \\end{equation} For this case it is shown that\\mathcal{R}_{\\phi,\\psi} (\\tau) \\leq \\mathcal{R}_{\\phi,\\psi}(0)for any nondecreasing (or nonincreasing) distortion functions\\phiand\\psi. The result is then applied to generalize an inequality on correlation functions for periodic signals due to Prosser. Noise signals are treated and inequalities of a similar nature are obtained for ensemble-average cross correlation functions under suitable hypotheses on the statistical properties of the noise. Inequalities of this type are the basis of a well-known method of estimating the unknown time delay of an observed signal. The extension to nondecreasing discontinuous distortion functions allows the use of hard limiting or quantization to facilitate the cross correlation calculation."
"Analogously to the rate distortion function, the error distortion function is defined for a multiple-hypothesis decision problem. The error distortion functione(d)is defined as the supremum of the Bayes' error probability for transformed observations for which the average distortion is less thand (d \\geq O)The main result is that the functione(d)is continuous at O."
"The decoding of efficiently encoded messages, from either probabilistic, nonprobabilistic, or unknown message sources, is shown to be often practically impossible. If\\tau(S)is a running-time bound on the computational effort of a decoder\\Psiaccepting a codewordPfor messageS, and\\gamma[K_{\\Psi}(S)]is an upper bound to acceptable codeword length\\mid P \\midwhen the shortest codeword forShas lengthK_{\\Psi}(S), then for many message sources\\mathcal{M}there exist messagesS \\in \\mathcal{M}such that: 1) if the encoder satisfies\\gamma, then the decoder violates\\tau; 2) if the decoder satisfies\\tau, then the encoder violates\\gamma. These conclusions remain valid even when we allow the decoder to reconstruct only an approximationS \\primein a neighborhood\\delta(S)ofS. The compatibility of these results with those of information theory rests upon the fact that we are inquiring into the detailed properties of coding systems for individual messages and not into the ensemble average properties."
"This paper reexamines Jelinek's proof that tree codes can be used to approach the rate-distortion bound. It is shown that the branching process used in Jelinek's proof is not a (strict-sense) branching process (SSBP) when the source is asymmetric. Branching processes with random environments (BPWRE) are introduced and used to extend the proof to general discrete-time memoryless sources. The theory developed indicates why a particular metric used in experiments performed better than another suggested by the original proof."
"Recently developed methods of tree source coding with a fidelity criterion are applied to speech coding. We first demonstrate that tree codes are inherent in A-D speech convertors of the waveform following type and point to ordinary and adaptive delta modulation and differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) as examples. Insights of coding theory improve these trees at low rates; we offer two new code classes, one obtained by smoothing the DPCM tree and one using the rate-distortion theory of autoregressive sources. Using these codes, we study the performance of a simple synchronous tree searching algorithm called theM-algorithm that maintains a small fixed number of paths in contention. 1 and 2 bit/sample code trees, used to encode actual speech at 8, 10, and 16 kbits/s, yield improved dynamic range and channel error resistance, and 4-8 dB improvement in mean-square error (mse) over ordinary single-path searched DPCM. These improvements in excess of analytical estimates suggest that tree coding methods perform better with real-life sources than previously thought."
"This paper proves that there exists a fixed random coding Strategy for block coding a memoryless information source to achieve the absolute epsilon entropy of the source. That is, the strategy can be chosen independent of the block length. The principal new tool is an easy result on the semicontinuity of the relative entropy functional of one probability distribution with respect to another. The theorem generalizes a result from rate-distortion theory to the \"zero-infinity\" case."
"In data processing, a transmitterTandreceiverRcommunicate via a random-access memorymthat they share with a setUof other users.Tselects a codewordcfrom a setCknown toRand storescin some of the cells ofm, not necessarily adjacent to one another.Udoes not change the valuesThas stored but fills in the values stored in the other cells ofm.Cis said to be distinguishable ifRcan always find which codewordTstored inmno matter whatUstores in the other cells and to be locally distinguishable ifRcan do so reading only the values written byTnot byU.

Generalizations of the Kraft inequality to this setting follow and give lower bounds to the numbers of cells occupied by the members of a distinguishable set of codewords and to the numbers of cells inmthatRmust access to distinguish among them. Upper bounds to numbers of necessary accesses are also given."
"Letp(y_1, y_2 \\mid x)denote a discrete memoryless channel with a single sourceXand two independent receiversY_1andY_2. We exhibit an achievable region of rates(R_{11},R_{12},R_{22})at which independent information can be sent, respectively, to receiver 1, to both receivers 1 and 2, and to receiver 2. The achievability of the region is shown by using a version of the asymptotic equipartition property involving many simultaneous \"typicality\" constraints. These results immediately generalize to yield an achievable rate region for them-sendern-receiver channel in terms of standard mutual information quantities."
"A model for channels in which an input sequence can produce output sequences of varying length is described. An efficient computational procedure for calculating Pr\\{Y\\mid X\\}is devised, whereX = x_1,x_2,\\cdots,x_MandY = y_1,y_2,\\cdots,y_Nare the input and output of the channel. A stack decoding algorithm for decoding on such channels is presented. The appropriate likelihood function is derived. Channels with memory are considered. Some applications to speech and character recognition are discussed."
"Justesen has shown that concatenating a class of binary codes with a Reed-Solomon (RS) code produces asymptotically good codes. For low rates, the value of the ratio of minimum distance to code length(d/n)for such codes is substantially lower than that known to be achievable by the Zyablov bound. In this paper, we present a small class of binary codes with some useful properties. This class is then used in Justesen's construction to produce codes that have relatively large values ofd/nfor low rates."
"We show that the optimum decoder for a linear code over a finite field can be implemented by a bank of bandpass filters that are defined in a generalized frequency domain. This decoder has a fixed signal processing structure and uses complex-valued arithmetic operations instead of the usual finite field ones, This structure closely resembles one of the usual digital filter mechanizations. The emphasis in this paper is on general additive channels. The maximum likelihood decoder configuration for a ratek/ncode is a bank ofkbandpass filters whose outputs are the decoded information digits. The parameters that define the filters are directly related to the channel statistics, and each of the band-pass filters is composed ofrbranch filters where the order of the field is therth power of a prime. The processing requirements can further be reduced by detuning each branch filter and following it by a real roundoff operation. These possibilities have not been fully exploited and remain an open question. A procedure for determining the filter weights needed in the branch filters that uses fast transform techniques is demonstrated. The probability of correct decoding can be computed using functions defined over the transform domain. Finally, we show that suboptimal decoders, which may also include detection capabilities, can be derived from this work. A hierarchy of suboptimal decoding levels is proposed so as to reduce the average computational requirements of the decoder."
"Both noiseless source coding and source coding with a fidelity criterion are traditionally accomplished via the mapping of consecutive nonoverlapping source blocks into code blocks of fixed or variable length. Here we use an easy application and interpretation of the Kolmogorov-Ornstein isomorphism theorem of ergodic theory to prove the existence of a new class of noiseless source coding techniques consisting of nonlinear time-invariant discrete-time filters. The output codes are physically stationary, are not of variable length, require no buffers except for the filter memory, are not catastrophically affected by occasional channel errors, and provide a new interpretation of noiseless source coding. An information-theoretic interpretation of an early special case of the isomorphism theorem provides an example. The noiseless sliding-block theorem is then coupled with the sliding-block source coding subject to a fidelity criterion theorem to obtain a general sliding-block source coding theorem for noiseless and almost noiseless Channels. The approach, assumptions, and results are compared and contrasted with the special cases of quantization, delta modulation, and block stationary convolutional, trellis, tree, Viterbi, and sequential source coding techniques."
"We consider the spectral properties of the first difference of two-level codes. These considerations arise where signal recovery involves differencing or differentiation. We develop a general model and propose specific codes whose differences guarantee such properties as null dc, null midband, positive, and strictly positive midband content."
"Suppose0 \\leq i,j \\leq 2^n - 1. We prove that, ifi,jare encoded as binary Gray codewords whose Hamming distance ism \\geq 1, then\\mid i-j \\mid < 2^n - 2^m /3."
"Application of sequential testing to a Markovian model of cardiac rhythm intervals is investigated. An approximate expression for the expected number of observations is obtained for Wald's sequential test under dependent sampling. The interclass separability of three selected cardiac rhythms is then determined, and the results are used to evaluate the feasibility of an on-line implementation of a sequential classification procedure in a coronary care ward."
"In this correspondence, we construct a new class of binary codes by exploiting the symmetry properties of the parity check matrix of the Srivastava codes. The construction is a generalization of Goppa's construction [1]. A number of the binary codes constructed are proved equal, or superior, to the best codes previously known."
"In this correspondence, we present a new class of binary codes that are constructed on the basis of BCH codes. Some examples of these codes are given, having more codewords than the best codes previously known (to the authors) with the same minimum distance and number of check symbols. A decoding algorithm for the codes is also described."
"If the vectors of some constant weight in the dual of a binary linear code support a(\\nu,b,r,k,\\lambda)balanced incomplete block design (BIBD), then it is possible to correct[(r + 2 - 1)/2\\lambda]errors with one-step majority logic decoding. This bound is generalized to the case when the vectors of certain constant weight in the dual code support at-design. With the aid of this bound, the one-step majority logic decoding of the first, second, and third order Reed-Muller codes is examined."
"The double-error-correcting capabilities of the Iwadare and of the Berlekamp--Preparata-Massey burst-correcting codes are analyzed."
"Chen et al. [1] give a list of quasi-cyclic (2m,m) codes which have the largest minimum distance of any quasi-cyclic code, for various values ofm. We present the weight distribution of these codes. It will be seen that many of the codes found by Chen et al. [1] are equivalent in the sense of having identical weight distributions."
"In this correspondence a method is presented whereby the average synchronization-error-correcting capability of Tavares' subset codes may be improved with no additional cost in rate and with only a small increase in the complexity of encoding and decoding. The method consists simply in shifting every word of the subset codes in such a way so that the shifted versions have a maximum number of leading and trailing zeros. A lower bound on the increase in synchronization-error-correcting capability provided by this method is derived."
"It is shown that, under certain conditions, two strongly interfering communication links with additive white Gaussian noise can achieve rates as high as would be achievable without this interference."
"A random signal observed in additive noise is to be linearly preprocessed for transmission via a channel of dimensionality less than that of either the observations or the signal. At the receiver, the signal is to be linearly reconstructed under a weighted-mean-square-error criterion. It is shown that there is no loss of overall optimality if the operation on the raw observations is partitioned into an optimal (least mean-square-error) prefilter followed by a linear coder."
"Axioms characterizing combinatorial discrimination information are given and extended to characterize arbitrary measure theoretic discrimination information."
"A simple approach to recent generalizations of BCH and Goppa codes, viewed as subfield subcodes of modified Reed-Solomon codes, is presented. The orthogonal complements of these codes are characterized, and generalized versions of some previous results about minimum distance and decoding are obtained."
"If the constraint length of a convolutional code is defined suitably, it is an obvious upper bound on the free distance of the code, and it is sometimes possible to find codes that meet this bound. It is proved here that the length of a rate1/\\nu q-ary code with this property is at mostq\\nu, and we construct a class of such codes with lengths greater thanq\\nu/3."
"LetX, Ybe a pair of discrete random variables with a given joint probability distribution. For0 \\leq x \\leq H(X), the entropy ofX, define the functionF(x)as the infimum ofH(Y\\mid W), the conditional entropy ofYgivenW, with respect to all discrete random variablesWsuch that a)H(X\\mid W) = x, and b)WandYare conditionally independent givenX. This paper concerns the functionF, its properties, its calculation, and its applications to several problems in information theory."
"Random processes that generate information slower than linearly with time are termed information-singular. The study of information-singularity contributes to a more thorough understanding of the mathematical nature of information generation. Specifically, it elucidates the manner in which generation of information by a time series is critically dependent on the detailed behavior of the sample functions of its spectral representation. The main theorem states that any random sequence whose spectral representation has stationary independent increments with no Brownian motion component is information-singular in the mean-squared sense. The concept of information-singularity can be construed as a means for discriminating between deterministic and nondeterministic processes. It is felt that information-singularity fulfills this discriminating function in a physically more satisfying manner than does the classical Hilbert space theory of linear and nonlinear prediction. The desire for a still more satisfying discriminant motivates investigation of the class of random processes that retain their information-singularity even when corrupted by additive noise. In the case of strictly stationary processes, the discussion focuses on the relationship between information-singularity and zero entropy. Lastly, some alternative definitions of information-singularity are considered and several open problems are identified."
"A unified theory is developed for fixed rate block source encoding subject to a fidelity criterion in incompletely or inaccurately specified stationary statistical environments. Several definitions of universal encoding are given and compared, and the appropriate theorems are stated and proved for each. The new results and approaches are compared and contrasted with earlier related results of Ziv."
"The standard definition of the distortion-rate function involves a limit of information-tbeoretic minimizations over distributions of random vectors. Several alternative definitions, each involving a single minimization over random processes, are presented here and verified. These definitions parallel Khinchine's process definition of channel capacity, provide a new interpretation of block and nonblock source coding (with a fidelity criterion) theorems in terms of optimal stochastic codes, and provide a comparison between the optimal performance theoretically attainable (OPTA) using block and nonblock source codes. Coupling the process definitions with recently developed bounding techniques provides a new and simple proof of the block source coding theorem for ergodic sources."
"Optimal quantum measurements of regression coefficients in the presence of quantum Gaussian noise are considered. The best unbiased measurements are found in a particular case. General solutions for the multimode Bayes problem and the problem of optimal joint measurement of canonical observables are obtained, including explicit characterization of the optimal measurement."
"The minimum distanced_{\\text{min}}is the fundamental performance parameter for modems using maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE). This paper provides a procedure for finding the minimum distance for classes of systems of moderate complexity, e.g., with a few hundred states. This is done by applying various rules which reduce the set of error sequences that have to be considered to a small number. Nulls in the channel's frequency spectrum reduce the number of critical error sequences still further. Examples using the procedure are given for many classes of responses of interest. It is also noted that the optimum transmitter design problem is a convex programming problem."
"The rate of convergence of the nearest neighbor (NN) rule is investigated when independent identically distributed samples take values in ad-dimensional Euclidean space. The common distribution of the sample points need not be absolutely continuous. An upper bound consisting of two exponential terms is given for the probability of large deviations of error probability from the asymptotic error found by Cover and Hart. The asymptotically dominant first term of this bound is distribution-free, and its negative exponent goes to infinity approximately as fast as the square root of the number of preclassified samples. The second term depends on the underlying distributions, but its exponent is proportional to the sample size. The main term is explicitly given and depends very weakly on the dimension of the space."
"In digital communication systems, the error probability in the presence of intersymbol interference (II) and additive noise may be calculated to any desired degree of accuracy by well-known approximation methods which avoid the exponential computation growth (with the number of interferers) inherent in an exhaustive method, on the condition that a fast technique for computing II moments is available. Such a technique is indeed available at present, but it is strongly limited by the assumption that the data symbols are mutually independent. In this paper, this limitation is removed, and a fast procedure is given for computing H moments of correlated digital signals. The computations grow linearly with the number of interferers. The assumption made is that correlated symbols are produced by a general finite-state sequential machine. As illustrative examples, the fast procedure is applied to bipolar and Franaszek MS-43 codes."
"A subclass of Huffman sequences is examined and evaluated in terms of an analytically defined figure of merit which would be optimal for sequences of pulses of equal amplitude."
"We define a class of easily implementable suboptimum codes for runlengths of binary facsimile images which we call linear runlength codes because the number of bits we transmit for each run is approximately proportional to its length. Then, assuming the runlengths are geometrically distributed, we derive bounds on the minimum bit rate achievable by linear runlength codes of a given size."
"The weight distribution of some \"best\"(3m,2m)rate 2/3 binary quasi-cyclic codes of length up to 54 is discussed. The approach taken was to compute the weight distribution of the corresponding(3m,m)rate 1/3 dual code, and then take advantage of the MacWilliams' identities to derive the weight distribution of the(3m,2m)code."
"In this paper we present a class of burst-error-correcting binoid codes derived from Samoylenko's codes. These codes, at high code rate, seem to be very useful for a not-too-noisy transmission channel when the encoding-decoding operations are performed by means of a general purpose computer."
"The class of linear codes introduced by Goppa are noncyclic in general. The only Goppa codes known to be cyclic are the Bose--Chaudhuri-Hocquengbem (BCH) codes which are a special class of Goppa codes. Recently, Berlekamp and Moreno showed that certain double-error-correcting binary Goppa codes become cyclic when extended by an overall parity check. In this correspondence, results of a further investigation on extending Goppa codes to cyclic codes are presented. It is shown that a large class of multiple-error-correctingq-ary Goppa codes also become cyclic when extended by an overall parity check. These Goppa codes are found to be reversible. The Goppa codes considered in this correspondence consist of two subclasses that, after extension, give rise to the two subclasses of reversible cyclic codes of primitive and nonprimitive length, respectively. These cyclic codes are noted to include, respectively, the expurgated Melas codes and the Zetterberg codes as special cases."
"An algorithm is presented for the calculation of a cycle set for any cyclic code which has an irreducible parity-check polynomial."
"The Berry-Esseén theorem has been used to show that narrow-band filtering tends to make non-Gaussian noise more Gaussian. In this correspondence, the same theorem is invoked to demonstrate that wide-band filtering can also make noise more Gaussian, provided the filter impulse response has a large time-bandwidth product."
"An intersymbol interference bound is derived for multilevel and pseudoternary digital systems. The error bound is expressed in simple closed form. Monte Carlo trials are used to compare the accuracy of the bound with others recently published. The optimum matching point for the exponential bound is also determined."
"For band-limited functions with finite energy, it is known that bounds on the truncation error incurred when the function is approximated by2N + 1terms in the cardinal expansion can be obtained that go to zero likeN^{-1/2}. If the additional restriction is made that a guard band is present (that is, the function is sampled faster than the minimum rate), then bounds can be obtained that go to zero likeN^{-1}, both for finite energy functions and for functions having absolutely integrable Fourier transforms. It is shown here that these bounds are all asymptotically the best possible. It is also shown that, in the absence of a guard band, bund-limited functions with absolutely integrable Fourier transforms exist for which the truncation error goes to zero arbitrarily slowly."
"Buxbaum has reported on three algorithms for computing least squares estimates that are based on fixed amounts of data. In this correspondence, the filter is arranged as a point-deleting Kalman filter concatenated with the standard point-inclusion Kalman filter. The resulting algorithm is couched in a square root framework for greater numerical stability, and special attention is given to computer implementation."
"In this correspondence, we examine the problem of estimating the centroid of a normally shaped intensity function of a time-space point process in terms of an observed realization of the point process. The centroid is assumed to move randomly as a projection of a Gauss-Markov process. We find that the centroid is conditionally normal given the observations. Dynamical equations are given for the conditional mean and covariance of the centroid. The resulting filter is nonlinear, but closely related to the continuous-discrete Kalman-Bucy filter. An application to optical position sensing is given."
"The performance of a likelihood ratio processor must often be determined via computer simulation. This correspondence suggests an effective method of calculating the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) that avoids emphasizing the upper tail region of the likelihood ratio's estimated probability density function. A specific example is presented."
"A recently presented series solution to smoothing, filtering, and prediction problems is extended to include correlation between the white and colored components of the observations, as required in applications to feedback communications and feedback control."
"Satisfactory proof does not yet exist for the consistency of \"learning with a probabilistic teacher\" estimators, which are a class of randomized decision-directed estimators for adaptive multihypothesis decision making. Since a number of computer simulations described in the published literature indicate that the algorithms are convergent, we take as our starting point the assumption that this is generally true and develop an equation for use in determining for general distributions whether convergence is to the true parameter value. Using a numerical solution, we show that for the example of two one-dimensional Gaussian hypotheses and one unknown mean (the example appearing in the paper introducing the algorithm), if the estimator is convergent, convergence is to the true parameter value. Our formulation should be of help in constructing a more complete solution to the convergence problem and may be of use in investigating the consistency of other adaptive decision-making algorithms."
"Two different criteria used in supervised learning detectors are shown to be equivalent. One criterion is of the \"least mean-square error\" form, and the other is of the \"maximum signal-to-noise ratio\" type. The minimization (or maximization) of these two criteria yields the same weight matrices when the decision functions are of quadratic form. The probability distributions of signal and noise are assumed to be unknown to the detectors."
"This article is concerned with the video signal obtained when a coherent pulsed radar scans through moving scintillating scatrefers (clutter). In particular, a formula is obtained for the autocorrelation function of the clutter, assuming Gaussian distributions of doppler and scintillation for the scatterers. Results are included on a computer model developed to simulate clutter with predefined characteristics."
"Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the output of a zero-memory nonlinearity is defined and found when the input is a complex Gaussian process. The results are applied to an odd\\nu \\primeth law device and to an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter exhibiting both saturation and quantization."
"For conditional probability density functions (pdf's) drawn from the exponential family, it is shown that the marginal pdf is completely determined by a posterior conditional mean estimate (CME). This result implies that likelihood ratios involving these marginals have the estimator-correlator structure in the following sense: if the noise is drawn from an exponential pdf, then independent of the signal (prior pdf), the optimum detector correlates the estimate with the data. A generalization of Esposito's result on \"pseudoestimates\" is also given."
"A new class of generalized stack algorithms for decoding convolutional codes is presented. It is based on the Zigangirov-Jelinek (Z-J) algorithm but, instead of extending just the top node of the stack at all times, a number of the most likely paths are simultaneously extended. This number of paths may be constant or may be varied to match the current decoding effort with the prevalent noise conditions of the channel. Moreover, the trellis structure of the convolutional code is used by recognizing and exploiting the reconvergence of the paths. As a result the variability of the computation can be reduced up to a limit set by the \"ideal\" stack algorithm. Although the tail of the computational distribution is still Pareto, it is shown and verified from simulation with short constraint length codes(K \\leq 9)of rate\\frac{1}{2}that, compared to sequential decoding, the variability of the number of computations per decoded bit and the maximum computational effort are both reduced at the cost of a modest increase in the average decoding effort. Moreover, some of the error events of sequential decoding are corrected. These algorithms fill the gap between the one-path sequential decoding nad the all-path Viterbi decoding."
"A procedure is introduced to approximate nearest neighbor (INN) decision boundaries. The algorithm produces a selective subset of the original data so that 1) the subset is consistent, 2) the distance between any sample and its nearest selective neighbor is less than the distance from the sample to any sample of the other class, and 3) the subset is the smallest possible."
"In this correspondence, it is shown that an adaptive quantizer with a one word memory can be viewed as one that estimates the variance of its input and normalizes the input by the square root of the estimate. It is shown that, even though the estimate is an exponential average, the effect of transmission errors does not die out. Finally, a method of combating the effect of such errors is described."
"For the sum of two sinusoids of incommensurable frequencies, the number of zero-crossings per secondZis calculated. By averaging this result over a Rayleigh distribution for the amplitude of one of the sinusoids, Rice's formula is obtained for the numberzof zero-crossings per second of a sinusoid plus Ganssian noise of any spectrum. Simple approximations are obtained forzin the high-signal-to-noise-ratio and narrow-band cases. In addition, alternative derivations ofZandzare presented that further illuminate the significance of the foregoing results."
"The exact solution is provided for the probability distribution (PD) function of the modulo2\\piphase of a sine wave in narrow-band normal noise by means of several infinite series. Closed-form exact results are reported at\\pi/4and3\\pi/4."
"Using kernel estimates of the Parzen type, a naive sequential nonparametric density estimation procedure is developed. The asymptotic distribution structure of the stopping variable is examined. The stopping variable is shown to have finite moments of ail order and is shown to be dosed. The stopping variableNdepends on some preassigned error\\varepsilon, and it is shown thatNdiverges strongly to\\inftyas\\varepsilonconverges to zero. Finally, with\\hat{f}_n(x)being a kernel-type estimator, it is shown that\\hat{f}_N(X)converges tof(x), the true density atx, with probability one as\\varepsilonconverges to zero."
"Let\\{(X_i, Y_i,)\\}_{i=1}^{\\infty}be a memoryless correlated source with finite alphabets, and let us imagine that one person, encoder 1, observes onlyX^n = X_1,\\cdots,X_nand another person, encoder 2, observes onlyY^n = Y_1,\\cdots,Y_n. The encoders can produce encoding functionsf_n(X^n)andg_n(Y^n)respectively, which are made available to the decoder. We determine the rate region in case the decoder is interested only in knowingY^n = Y_1,\\cdots,Y_n(with small error probability). In Section H of the paper we give a characterization of the capacity region for degraded broadcast channels (DBC's), which was conjectured by Bergmans [11] and is somewhat sharper than the one obtained by Gallager [12]."
"In certain communications problems, such as remote telemetry, it is important that any operations performed at the transmitter be of a simple nature, while operations performed at the receiver can frequently be orders of magnitude more complex. Channel coding is well matched to such situations while conventional source coding is not. To overcome this difficulty of usual source coding, we propose using a convolutional encoder for joint source and channel encoding. When the channel is noiseless this scheme reduces to a convolutional source code that is simpler to encode than any other optimal noiseless source code known to date. In either case, decoding can be a minor variation on sequential decoding."
"In this paper, the dynamic range of Fourier-like transforms over the Galois fieldGF(q^2), whereqis a Mersenne prime, is extended. It is shown that transforms over a direct sum of such Galois fields can be used to compute quite accurately discrete Fourier transforms of complex numbers without roundoff error."
"Digital data systems are considered in which reception is based on the principle of maximum-likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) and in which the channel has the coaxial cable power transfer characteristice^{-\\alpha \\mid \\omega \\mid ^{1/2} }. When only the average transmitter output power and the response memory (\\nu) are constrained, it is shown that, as\\alphaincreases, the optimal overall system impulse response tends to a partial response for which the corresponding frequency characteristic is proportional to the unique normalized trigonometric polynomial having\\nuth order zeros at the Nyquist bandlimits. These same partial responses result if\\alphais fixed and the band rate is increased. This observation helps explain a recent numerical study by Fredricsson that has stirred wide-spread interest. The minimum distance associated with such an optimal response is tabulated for various values of\\nuand various numbers of levels."
"Generalized harmonic analysis in the sense of Wiener is extended to the framework of Schwartz distributions. The approach seems mathematically and physically more transparent than the classical scheme, since every distribution possesses a Fourier transform so that the use of integrated Fourier transforms is avoided. A generalized Wiener-Khintchine representation is given which agrees well with the intuitive concept of the power spectrum. The latter is shown to be a tempered measure, in general, whose support is contained in the support of the Fourier transform of the signal. The correlation functional and power spectrum of filtered distributional signals is derived for a class of generalized filter impulse responses, which includes those that have bounded support or correspond to stable rational transfer functions. As an illustration, the form of the correlation functional and power spectrum for periodic and almost-periodic distributions and for delta-pulse trains occurring in sampled-data systems is given, and a deterministic white noise signal is constructed."
"In this paper a novel theory and algorithm for spectral factorization is presented. It is based on a criterion for minimal extraction of a so-called \"elementary factor.\" Although not all positive para-hermitian matrices can be minimally factored into elementary factors, still the method can be adapted to fit the general case by increasing the degree in a well-controlled way and removing the nonminimal units of degree at the end. The method is, in this sense, strictly minimal. Moreover, the algorithm produces the spectral factor in ali cases where such a factorization does exist. Also, an independent proof of the famous spectral factorization result of Youla is obtained, so that the completeness of the method is ascertained. The procedure results in a workable and optimally minimal algorithm."
            "Several publications in the past have discussed the potential of batch fabricated thin film heads. Most of these publications dealt with theoretical predictions. Only a few discussed fabrication techniques and reported on the write and read test results. This paper describes a fabrication process for single turn thin film heads of vertical configuration. The process utilizes well known evaporation, plating, and photolithographic techniques. It is simple, inexpensive, and amenable to batch fabrication. Heads fabricated using this process were shown to write and read on a disk, moving at 40 m/s (1575 in/s) with ∼6 Kfr/cm. Dynamic test results reported in a paper by Valstyn and Shew corroborate the earlier prediction. This paper also discusses and compares advantages and disadvantages of the single turn heads of a vertical configuration with those of a horizontal configuration."
"The 45° mitered-overlap joint is commonly used in the construction of large power transformer cores. There are several variables which affect the performance of such cores with respect to core loss and exciting current. The major variables investigated in this paper are 1) overlap distance, 2) stagger layer thickness, and 3) overlap method, namely, simple staggering versus step-lap. Also investigated to a lesser degree were the effect of frequency and the effect of series air gaps at the corners. One set of results in this paper is not in agreement with a previous paper and reasons for this are speculated. The other sets of results are new, and indicate that staggering beyond two laminations per stagger is not advisable, that the difference between one and two laminations per stagger is marginal, and that the use of a step-lap joint reduces exciting current requirements but not core loss."
"A better understanding of flux behavior within specific regions of a transformer core can lead to improved core design and magnetic efficiency. Flux paths and the flux transfer mechanisms have been determined for two practical T joints of different designs employed in two similar three-phase three limbed transformer cores. Each core was energized at three different core flux densities. The instantaneous flux density patterns both parallel to and perpendicular to the rolling plane of the laminations are presented in graphical and vectorial forms for both types of T joints. By \"freezing\" the continually changing flux pattern within a T joint, it was possible to trace individual flux paths through the joint and to determine the basic flux transfer mechanism between adjacent laminations. Flux behavior within the joints shows that while its path is dependent on both T joint design and core flux density, the basic flux transfer mechanism remains unchanged in both T joints and at all core flux densities."
"A liquid analog of a magnetic bubble domain shift register has been constructed, using ferrofluid and an immiscible liquid. Bubble sizes from 50 to 1000 microns have been observed, with propagation frequencies to 60 Hz and propagation velocities for 300 micron bubbles of up to 6 cm/ sec. Display applications for these phenomena are discussed."
"Pulsed magnetic fields (widths of 1 to 550 ns) with amplitudes above a threshold value will generate crossties [1] in Permalloy films (∼300 to 500 Å). Pulse width and film thickness affect the threshold values, which decrease with increasing pulse width and increasing film thickness. Fig. 2 shows typical behavior."
"Plated wire memory elements with good NDRW-characteristics can be produced by a sandwich diffusion technique. A thin layer of tin is placed between a smooth copper and the permalloy film and the wire has to be annealed before and after the plating of the permalloy. The reproducibility and the extrapolated long time stability were good. The parameters of this technology and the influence of the two annealing temperatures on the memory characteristics are described. The two fold diffusion of the tin film into the copper and permalloy layers produces the NDRW-behavior."
"The propagation of magnetic waves in an infinite medium with a periodic dielectric constant is studied as a simplified example to evaluate the applications of periodic structures. Specifically, the use of those structures for filtering and distributed feedback is investigated, and a new scheme for the generation of magnetic waves using drifting charges and a distributed feedback configuration similar to DFB lasers is studied in some detail."
"An improved technique for observing subnanosecond magnetization changes in thin films has been used to study the underdamped oscillatory behavior in a (Y2.5Gd0.5) (Fe4Ga1)O12sample. The measurement setup uses a version of the alternate sampling technique in which the sensitivity has been upgraded by the use of a lock-in amplifier. By using a shorted stripline of appropriate length to apply to the film two properly timed magnetic field steps, the precession of the magnetization can be quelled, and the magnetization can be switched between initial and final directions in a half-cycle of the resonant frequency."
"The calculation of the static behavior of the magnets of an electromagnetic levitation system can be performed using a numerical field calculation method. The agreement of measured with calculated values is satisfactory. Besides the excitation losses of the magnets, there are also losses due to eddy currents in the rails. Some measurements, calculations, and important parameters for these eddy current effects are also discussed. Not only the analysis of the magnets but also the design, optimized with regard to certain conditions is important. Some examples show the optimization of the magnet using a non-linear optimization method. The paper closes with the description of the dynamic behavior of the magnet using different linear and nonlinear models."
"Ferrite inductors are usually made in two parts with mating and air gap surfaces perpendicular to the flux path. In the course of manufacture these surfaces are ground flat, and this machining operation is found to increase the loss factor (L.F.), (\\tan \\delta_{r+F})/\\mu_{e}, by up to 33%, measured at a frequency of 100 kHz. It is known that grinding puts the surface of a ceramic into compression, and it is shown that the stress in the surface approaches 700 MN m-2, decreasing to zero at a depth of 5μm or so below the surface. The permeability in this surface layer is greatly reduced, and so the L.F. is. enormously increased, since tan\\delta/\\mu = \\mu\"/(\\mu')^{2}. The mean value of the L.F. in this surface layer is estimated to be about600 \\times 10^{-6}, compared with about1.5 \\times 10^{-6}in the interior. A theoretical expression is derived for the increase in L.F. of an inductor assembly, induced by grinding the surfaces perpendicular to the flux, which accounts quite well for the change observed. Ground surfaces parallel to the flux have virtually no effect on L.F., since little flux penetrates them, but the stresses which they generate in the body of the ferrite influence the temperature factor."
"A steady-state solution for the electromagnetic field in solid iron including both hysteresis and eddy-current effects is obtained by considering only fundamental components of flux density and magnetising force, expressed in terms of phasor vectors, and related by complex permeability. StaticB/Hloops for a material are used to give the complex permeability characteristic as a function of magnetizing force permitting a nonlinear magnetization characteristic to be represented. Computed results together with some measured values are given for the surface loss and the distribution of flux in mild steel subjected to traveling-wave or pulsating excitation."
"On the basis of known ferroresonant voltage regulator circuits with separate cores and with sinusoidal output waveforms, a new advantageous circuit has been suggested. This circuit has been used as an example of computer simulation of ferroresonant voltage regulators, especially in connection with the use of inverters. The principle of computer simulation and the doubtful advantage regarding the use of a special language of simulation are discussed. The accuracy of the first-harmonic analysis, which is usually applied, is examined, especially in connection with the lowest input voltage of the regulation range."
"A four-parameter variational model is used to calculate the properties of stripe domains in uniaxial magnetic films. The width of the stripes and the thickness of the walls between the stripes are allowed to vary. In addition, the effects of the demagnetizing fields across the walls are included by allowing the spins within the walls to twist out of the wall plane. It is shown that the presence of neighboring walls in this model yields a substantially higher wall energy density in most cases of importance to bubble technology than was previously reported by Schlömann for a similar model of an isolated wall, the stripe wall energy density being over 50 percent higher in the case where the dimensionless anisotropy parameterq = K_{u}/2\\piM^{2}is 1.1 and the film thickness to material length ratioh/lis 9. A critical discussion of the significance of wall energies in such models is given, and a method is discussed by which the stripe-width information from this model may be used in interpreting stripe-width data to obtain material parameters to an accuracy hitherto unavailable."
"Summary form only given, as follows. From its founding, almost ten years ago, the IEEE Transactions on Magnetics has been published four rimes a year. Almost 700 to 800 pages of technical articles have been published annually for the past 6 to 8 years. This year we expect to publish over 900 pages and for the next few years, as far out as we can project, we expect to publish 1200 to 1400 pages. This recent increase is coming about, as you may have noticed, by arranging to include in this Transactions the proceedings of topical conferences in many areas of applied magnetism and superconductivity. Thus starting with this issue we will be publishing six issues each year. The March issue is scheduled to carry the Proceedings of the Applied Superconductivity Conference, the July issue will carry our Advances in Magnetics review articles, and the September issue will carry the Proceedings of the INTERMAG Conference. We trust that you are finding these additions interesting reading and accessible sources of technical information."
 "The normalB-Hcurves of several types of steel are shown to be approximated by the equationH= (k_{1} e^{k_{2}B^{2}} + k_{3}) B. The reluctivity (H/B) and its derivative with respect toBare given by simple equations that are especially useful in the finite element method of analyzing steel magnetic circuits."
 "Presents the front cover/table of contents for this issue of the periodical."
"Previous computations based on a conformal transformation are used as a guide in selecting a plausible magnetic scalar potential at the surface of the head. An analytic expression for the horizontal component of the field is obtained from this potential. Certain characteristics of the potential and field are discussed."
"An experimental magnetic bubble mass memory module complete with all control function and detection electronics has been built and operated. The module contains twenty-eight 16 448-bit mass memory chips and operates at a nominal rotating field frequency of 100 kHz. The module has an average access time of 2.7 ms, a read/write cycle time of 5.14 ms, and a data rate of 700 kbit/sec. A read error rate of <1.6 × 1012and error-free propagation in excess of 8.4 × 1015bubble cycles have been demonstrated."
"Presents the back cover of the periodical issue."
"This paper describes the results of driving bubbles with various rotating magnetic fields and proposes a triangulardrive method. This method is expected to furnish high power efficiency and simplification of the drive electronic circuit in practical magnetic-bubble memories."
"Studies of the superconducting properties of V3Ga single filament composite wires grown by solid state reaction are presented. The three alloy compositions investigated were: V/Cu-15.4 at.% Ga, V-6.1 at.% Ga/Cu- 15.4 at.% Ga and V-9.0 at.% Ga/Cu-17.5 at.% Ga. Critical currents were measured at 4.2K in transverse magnetic fields to 175kG and transition temperature data were obtained by ac mutual inductance techniques for V3Ga formed at temperatures from 525°C-700°C. Growth rates for V3Ga were strongly influenced by alloy composition and formation temperature with more rapid growth occurring in composite wires with higher Ga contents. In addition to the more rapid growth rates obtained, a factor of 10 improvement in the critical current density (Jc) also was exhibited in V3Ga grown at 600°C in the V- 9.0 at.%/Cu-17.5 at.% Ga composite specimen. The best Jcobserved to date was 106A/cm2in a transverse magnetic field of 100kG for a wire reacted at 550°C."
"A new technique to probe local magnetic fields inside superconductors utilizing the Mössbauer Effect (ME) is reported. The ME nucleus responds to the local magnetic field resulting in a modified hyperfine ME spectrum from which the local field and its direction may be deduced. Concentrations of a few ppm of the radioactive probe nucleus are sufficient; the allowable depth of the probe depends on the attenuation of the ME γ ray. For57Fe (57Co parent) in superconductors the field acts directly on the nuclear moment and the resulting sensitivity is only a few kG. For a thin probe consisting of57Co in Pd the response is enhanced by the \"giant\" localized moment providing a sensitivity at 1 K of better than 100 G. Results of such a probe placed at various locations across a commercial Nb3Sn tape carrying a current are reported and compared with calculations of the field profile using several models. For thin tape geometries the usual models prove to be inadequate."
"Quench currents and critical currents have been measured for a number of commercial Nb3Sn tapes at 4.2 K. The measurements were made at 60 Hz. The observed quench currents in the as-received tapes are considerably lower than the critical currents, which can be determined by a new technique after stabilizing material is added. The temperature dependence over the entire range above 4.2 K was measured for two of the samples. The critical current falls off approximately as 1-(T/Tc)2."
"Eastham and Rhodes published results of loss measurements on transposed superconducting NbTi cables and concluded basing on an extrapolation to very large numbers of wires that transposed superconductors could be used favourably in cables for power transmission. There are some reasons to question the correctness of their extrapolation. We calculated losses for transposed superconductors in self field and got results different from those of Eastham and Rhodes. Loss measurements were performed the results of which give evidence for the correctness of our calculations. Our results lead to the conclusion that the use of transposed cables of irreversible type 2 superconductors for power transmission is not advantageous."
"This paper deals with the origination and variation in length of the normal zone in a superconducting cable. A convenient approximate formula for the propagation velocity of a semi-infinite zone was obtained assuming a linear decrease of critical current with increasing temperature; the peculiarities of the normal zone's growth were studied in a cable with an initial gradient of gas temperature; the process of expansion and contraction of a normal zone of finite length is described. Data are given on the experimental study of the movement of a normal zone in the three-phase superconducting cable model."
"Superconducting helical resonators operating in the HF band at approximately 16 MHz have been designed and constructed to demonstrate the feasibility of passing a kilowatt of power at an operation Q of 1000 (QDL= 1000). Superconducting components are being considered to replace normal state circuits in communication systems, i.e. antennas and multicouplers. (A multicoupler is a device using coupled resonators which permits a number of transmitters to be simultaneously operated into one antenna.) The niobium helical resonators were polished and anodized after being fabricated using an electron-beam welding process. Teflon support structures were designed to minimize vibrational problems. The resonator was operated open to the helium bath and the resulting unloaded Q was in excess of 4×106. A kilowatt of power was transferred through the resonator when operating at a QDLof 1000. Work is now proceeding on the design and fabrication of a tunable resonator."
"Losses were calculated for and measured at 4.2°K in two mixed-matrix superconductors for the cases of transverse applied alternating fields superimposed upon zero or 5T transverse bias fields. The 0.080 in. × 0.160 in. conductors are composites of copper-sheathed Nb-Ti filaments twisted every 5 cm within a copper-nickel matrix, where the copper-nickel to copper to superconductor ratio is nominally 4:4:1. The conductors differ only in the copper-nickel alloy of the matrix and the associated matrix conductivities, sigmamcalorimetric measurements were performed with alternating fields ranging in frequency, f, from 0.3 to 12,800 Hz and from 2500 to 4 oersteds in amplitude Hm. Eddy current losses consistent with the theory and proportional toH_{m}^{2}f^{2}\\sigma_{m}andH_{m}^{2}f\\deg/\\sigma_{m}were observed. The measured losses were found to be less than the calculated losses and within 45% of the calculated losses in all cases."
"Transverse alternating field losses on a 1 mm × 1.4 mm monolithic multifilamentary composite superconductor were measured calorimetrically at 4.2K for frequencies between 0.1 Hz and 20,000 Hz. The conductor was placed in bias magnetic fields ranging from zero to 50 kOe and subjected to superimposed alternating fields with field amplitudes ranging from 10 Oe to 2 kOe. The classical partial penetration hysteresis loss and full penetration hysteresis loss were observed. Losses were also measured which can be attributed to eddy currents in the composite core. At very high frequencies, eddy current losses were observed resulting from the metallic sheath which encloses the composite core. The magnitude of the eddy current loss in the composite core is explained in terms of the diamagnetism exhibited by the superconducting filaments. The experimental data presented is analyzed using existing loss theories which have been appropriately modified using basic principles to account for the effect of filamentary diamagnetism at low alternating field amplitudes."
"We report calorimetric measurements of the ac losses of a small superconducting coil wound from a filament superconductor designed for low ac losses (filament φ = 8 μ,number of filaments 1045, CuNi barriers). The coil was pulsed with a maximum dB/dt = 480 kG/s. Further the ac losses were measured, when the coil current consisted of a dc- and a superimposed ac component with1 \\leq f \\leq500 Hz. The modification of the ac losses by the dc component of coil field and coil current was investigated."
"The critical current density in NbTi ribbons increases considerably and hysteretic (A.C.) losses decrease by an order of magnitude when a magnetic field is present along the length of the ribbon. In our work, rather than feeding a current to the sample through leads connected to an external supply, we cause persistent transport currents to flow along the length of the ribbon by induction (by applying a magnetic field transverse to the ribbon axis and along its broad faces). The magnitude of the induced currents, their pattern of circulation and the hysteretic losses are determined by monitoring the evolution of the magnetic moment of the ribbon both along its length and along the wide faces as the transverse field is cycled. We observe that when a longitudinal field is present, the induced currents adopt trajectories which are \"tilted\" and tend to lie along the total magnetic induction\\overrightarrow{B}along the flat faces of the ribbon, hence tend towards force-free configurations where\\overrightarrow{j} \\times \\overrightarrow{B} = 0."
"A method is described for production of A-15-type multifilament superconductors, based on mechanical size reduction of composites of unalloyed copper with niobium or vanadium cores. These cores are in themselves hollow and filled with fine grain size powder of an intermetallic compound of niobium or vanadium, rich in the second element of the required superconductor. After obtaining the final dimensions of the ductile composite without intermediate heat treatments, metal and intermetallic compounds are converted by heat treatment into the superconductor wbich is formed as a continuous layer inside the tublets. In particular the preparation is reported of V3Ga and V3Si conductors using V2Ga5and VSi2powder respectively. Critical current density values of seven filament wire are included, measured at 4.2 K up to 10 T."
"One restriction against applying superconducting rf cavities is the achievable rf residual surface resistance Rres, especially after surface damage. A theory is presented, where by interfacial quantum mechanic exchange between conduction band and localized states, momentum of the shielding current is transfered to the traps. For rf shielding currents this oscillating force on the localized states coherently generates transverse phonons. This transfer of momentum, due to the overlap of band and trap states, corresponds to an rf residual resistance which, for the first time, is able to describe consistently the observed Rres. In addition, the presented theory explains microscopically the observed rf-phonon-coupling."
"Superconducting, high Q rf resonators which are continuously tunable over at least a factor of three in frequency have been designed for operation in the range of a few hundred megahertz. Prototypes of these resonators have been fabricated of OFHC copper and electroplated with lead. Rf decay times of 18 msec at 240 MHz have been achieved in these resonators; the rf losses which dominate the Q are found to take place in a thin dielectric layer on the superconducting lead surface. This loss mechanism decreases the decay time about a factor of 10 from the decay time expected from the measured rf resistance of the Pb surfaces. Preliminary work on rapid (less than 1 msec full range) tuning of high Q resonators, which may lead to a new technique of electromechanical energy conversion, is reported."
"In this paper a new technique of electromechanical energy conversion is proposed. This technique would make use of the high Q's attainable in superconducting resonators to achieve direct mechanical to microwave energy conversion with a net efficiency greater than 90% a value which is far higher than that obtained by conventional techniques. In addition, if surface magnetic and electric field levels are limited by the critical fields obtained in fixed resonators, power densities would be achieved which are large enough to make such a machine a practical means both for generating microwave energy and for re-converting the microwave again to mechanical energy for power transmission purposes."
"A superconducting Nb0.4Ti0.6test cavity was constructed to measure the surface losses as function of frequency in the range from 2 to 8 GHz and as a function of temperature below 4.2 K. The temperature-dependent part of the surface resistance agrees essentially with the BCS theory if the material parameters Tc= 9.8 K, Δ(0) = 1.73 kBTc, ξo= 380 Å, λL= 310 Å, and\\ell = 4to 8 Å are taken. The magnitude and frequency dependence of the temperature-independent residual resistance observed in the niobium titanium cavity suggests no difference in the behavior of type I and II superconductors. The highest Qo= 2.9 × 109was measured in the TE011mode at 3.9 GHz. A coaxial cavity with removable sample was constructed for an in-depth study of rf breakdown and its relationship with metallurgical parameters as characterized by ac loss, magnetization, and penetration depth measurements. Peak fields in solid type-II superconducting cavities are limited by their low thermal conductivity suggesting the use of films, 0.01 to 0.1 mm thick, on pure niobium or copper. The highest magnetic field of 120 G was measured on a recrystallized sample suggesting that the lower critical field Hc1(for this sample 75 G) does not prevent the application of high-Tctype-II superconductors to microwave devices."
"Using a quarter wave coaxial resonator containing the superconducting sample as the center element, the resistive and reactive components of the surface impedance have been measured on niobium over the entire static H-field range of the mixed state at frequencies between 70 MHz and 930 MHz. The samples included one in the plastically deformed condition and one which had been annealed at 1800°C for 2 hours in a vacuum of 7 × 10-8torr; both had about the same resistivity ratio (∼14). The two samples differed considerably in the ratio of the resistive to reactive component of the surface impedance. The phenomena is believed to be a consequence of the nature of the electronic excitations characterizing the fluxiod cores."
"Data are presented of critical current density 'Jc(5T)' in a 5 T perpendicular magnetic field (and 10 T as well for selected samples) for multifilamentary Nb3Sn formed by Sn diffusion from a Cu-Nb composite's outer surface. The parameters varied are: composite diameter and Cu/Nb ratio; Sn percentage; filament diameter; reaction temperature and time; and different combinations of the above parameters. The composite diameter varied from 0.254 to 0.08 mm; Cu/Nb volume ratio from 1.7 to 3; volume percentage of Sn from 2% to 13.8%; average filament diameter from 2 microns to 7 microns. The reaction temperature was varied between 550° C to 795° C for different lengths of time, one to several thousand hours. A three-stage heat treatment was selected to formulate the basis for the reaction heat treatment map. The Jc(5T) varied from 103to > 3 × 105A/cm2over the entire composite cross section (Cu-Sn, Nb3Sn, Nb). The optimum performances were 38.8 A in 0.127 mm diam 1.9/1 Cu/(Nb + Nb3Sn) composite at 5 T and 78 A in a 0.18 mm diam 3/1 CU/(Nb + Nb3Sn) at 5 T."
"Magnetization measurements on diffused reacted samples were made at several temperatures T, between 4.2K and Tcand magnetic fields H up to 75 kOe. The samples were distinguished from each other by different heat treatments and diameter sizes ranges from 200-500 μm. From these measurements Jc(H,T) and Fp(H,T) curves were derived where Fpis the flux pinning force density. For all samples, Fp(H,T)/Fpmax(T) vs H/Hc2needs to be described by two functions, one for T < 8K and the other for T > 8k. This is in contrast to other materials where flux pinning is usually described by a single function."
"Practical magnet conductors of multifilamentary Nb3Sn have been produced in a collaborative programme between A.E.R.E. Harwell and Rutherford Laboratory. The evaluation of these bronze route conductors is described. Conductors studied range from a 1369 filament all-bronze matrix conductor to 5143 and\\sim42,000filament conductors, containing internal high purity copper protected by diffusion barriers. Filament sizes vary from\\sim 3 - 8 \\mum diameter. The effect of heat treatment conditions on critical current and transition temperature is presented and it is shown that overall critical current densities greater than those available in niobium titanium can now be produced in multifilamentary Nb3Sn magnet conductor."
"The stability of the multifilamentary(MF) V3Ga wire under pulsed excitation and the effect of the aluminum addition to the Cu-Ga alloy matrix have been investigated. Small coils wound by the MF V3Ga wire and by a similar MF Nb-Ti wire have been excited with a speed ranging 0.5-200 kOe/sec. The critical current of the MF V3Ga wire coil does not degrade up to an exciting speed as high as 200 kOe/sec, while that of the MF Nb-Ti wire coil decreases rapidly in exciting speed higher than 20 kOe/sec. The instability phenomena, e.g. flux jumps and training effects are much smaller in the MF V3Ga wire than in the MF Nb-Ti wire. The addition of aluminum in the Cu-Ga alloy matrix enhances the formation of V3Ga and increases the critical current. The partial substitution of aluminum for gallium in the Cu-Ga alloy matrix seems to be promising for increasing the current-carrying capacity and decreasing the cost of the wire."
"The state of development of multifilament V3Ga and Nb3Sn wires in Japan is reviewed with emphasis on the former as it is principally in Japan that V3Ga has undergone the most intensive development. Commercial sources for these materials are identified. A brief discussion is presented of the effort on commercial development of multifilament V3Ga wire in the United States."
"A study has been made of the possibility of making Nb3Al wires by interdiffusion between Al and Nb at relatively low temperatures (lower than 1000°C). This method should allow the fabrication of a copper stabilized wire by coworking Nb and Al composites in a copper matrix before the diffusion treatment. Results concerning the diffusion temperature and time de pendence of Jcand Tcare presented. While Jc(64kG) is quite high, of the order of 1.5×105A/cm2, Tcis 15.56°K, lower than the usually reported value. X- -ray measurements of the lattice parameter are also reported and correlated with the measured value of Tc."
"A summary report of a three-year study of superconductive energy storage for large utility systems is presented. The preferred conceptual design choices include: large, thin-walled solenoids, 1. 8 K cooling, TiNb in aluminum composite conductors at 5 tesla, bedrock structural support for both axial and radial forces, and a three-phase Graetz (ac/dc) bridge converter interface to the power grid. Preliminary estimates show that capital costs are given by $/kW = 40 + 125 (P/1000)-1/3(t/2)2/3Where P is the average power in MW and t is the discharge (peaking) time in hours. A typical operating loss is 10 ∼ 15% of the stored energy. The concept is technically feasible requiring only present day technology."
"The external multipole field of a superconducting solenoid is evaluated for large units buried in bedrock. Methods to partially cancel these fields are discussed. It is shown that external magnetic field \"pollution\" can be reduced at modest system expense."
"The progress achieved to date of a joint IGC-GE program for developing a practical multifilamentary Nb3Sn superconductor for use in a superconducting generator is described. The cable approach for producing a Nb3Sn conductor is evaluated, and the results of bend and tensile tests for various cables are presented. Fabrication methods for producing long lengths of multifilamentary Nb3Sn superconductor are discussed, and test data for several small coils are presented."
"The application of a new superconducting composite wire developed by C.C. Tsuei for high-field, high-current uses is explored. The importance of the dish continuous nature of the superconducting filaments in this material is analyzed. Our calculations indicate that practical wire may have a remnant resistivity of 10-14ohm-cm or less and we report our experiments to date in which we have tried to measure this quantity. We also report our observations of quantum coupling between filaments in this wire."
"Interest in Nb-Ti superconducting devices is exploding. This paper outlines the critical production criteria for this material. Areas discussed include ingot blending, melting, forging, extrusion and rod reducing with emphasis on the metallurgical considerations affecting mechanical properties. Data are included relating process parameters to TEM finding as well as R.T. ductility and optical microscopy. The significance of these starting material considerations is of interest to the composite wire maker as well as to the device manufacturer."
"A previously described D coil test program has been modified. Details of a smaller Nb3Sn D coil test program are described. Cusp coil tests have been made with several Nb3Sn composite ribbons. Measurements of both the quench and recovery currents as a function of magnetic field component perpendicular to the wide edge of the ribbon are presented."
"Two superconducting dipole magnet modules have been operated successfully at BNL since October 1973 to bend 30 GeV/c protons from the AGS by 8° in the new North Area beam to the 7-ft. Bubble Chamber. The magnets have been energized for over 1000 hours, and, of that time, have been traversed by the proton beam with beam intensities up to 5 × 1012protons per pulse, for about 750 hours. Operation of these series connected magnet units, each 2 meters long at 35kG has been routine even when they were intermittently subjected to beam heating of several hundred joules per pulse due to other operational beam difficulties. Experiments were also performed where copper blocks were inserted 2 meters upstream, resulting in very large interaction rates in the beam tube inside the units. A magnet quench occurred with target thicknesses such that energy approaching 1kJ per pulse was being absorbed in the system. These are the first superconducting magnets in operation in a primary beam on which extensive radiation heating tests have been performed."
"Experience in designing precision superconducting magnets for fields up to 60kG will be described. Realizable construction tolerances and their impact on field accuracy is discussed. For dipole fields up to 60kG or more, rectangular coil window frame type magnets will be compared with circular or elliptical coil designs. In all cases, the same superconductor current density versus maximum field performance is assumed. The comparison will include field quality and correction required as a function of aperture size, stored energy, ampere turns required, and overall magnet size. In quadrupole design the impact of the allowed superconductor current density being roughly inversely proportional to peak field is severe. For gradients up to one Tesla/cm or greater, similar comparisons for different types of quadrupole construction is made."
"A slow cycling flux pump has been constructed where operation is controlled by digital logic driving a high power operational amplifier. Hall sensors allow closed loop control of the secondary currents to enable switching the heater driven power cryotrons at the optimun time. Operating efficiency of 87% has been achieved."
"The embedding of superconductors is one component determining the behavior, such as training charcteristics or degradation, of superconducting coil assemblies. Mechanical, thermomechanical and electrical properties of potting or structural materials are discussed. A review of low temperature measurements of parameters, such as elastic moduli, work of fracture, thermal contraction and conductivity, specific heat and breakdown voltage on unfilled, filled or reinforced epoxy resins is given."
 "This new machine has two independent rotors, the driven inner rotor with the superconducting field winding and the free rotor which serves as the electro-mechanical shield. At steady state both rotate at synchronous speed, but during a fault transient the shield acts as a low-pass filter protecting the field from the large pulsations in torque and magnetic field. The new machine is described and its steady state and transient performance are outlined."
"Toroidal fusion devices will require superconducting magnet systems of greater size and complexity than heretofore constructed. A program employing the talents of a number of organizations for the development of superconducting magnets for toroidal fusion devices has been inaugurated. The objective of this program is to demonstrate the suitability and reliability of toroidal superconducting magnets for fusion research devices and experimental power reactors (EPR) in a time compatible with the AEC Controlled Thermonuclear Research (CTR) program goal for EPR construction during early 1980's. Since much of the superconductivity expertise resides now in AEC laboratories, the focus of the program is in these laboratories, but industrial and consultative participation is an integral part of the plan."
"Experimental results will be presented on the effects of optical radiation impinging on superconducting weak links and films. In-house fabricated weak links of various materials showed a lowering of critical current values dependent on radiation intensity. Also, specially modified commercial SQUIDS showed a lowering of both dc bias and rf bias required for SQUID operation as the optical intensity was increased. We will discuss the possibility of using high Tc materials for SQUID fabrication and the \"tuning\" of these devices via optical irradiation."
"The theta-pinch fusion test reactor proposed within the controlled thermonuclear research program at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory will demand that approximately 250 MJ be delivered into the plasma compression coil in one millisecond at a repetition rate of four per hour. Multiple modules of superconducting inductive storage will supply this pulsed energy. A Magnetic Energy Transfer and Storage (METS) facility has been constructed to test low-loss superconducting inductive energy storage modules, superconducting switches, and developmental high voltage circuit breakers. The storage module has been tested to 12.5 kA with 386 kJ stored energy."
"60 Hz losses were measured at 4.2 K in a number of Nb3Sn rods and tapes produced by the bronze-diffusion process and in commercial Nb3Sn tapes. At low fields (\\lsim900Oe), losses vary by more than two orders of magnitude among the different samples and are related to surface topography. At high fields (≳2 kOe) the variation among samples is much less, and depends mainly on the bulk critical current density Jc. The losses are analyzed quantitatively in terms of the critical state model, including a surface current."
"Gas-cooled cryogenic electric current leads which are operating at high ratios of current to mass flow are commonly used to supply electric current to superconducting magnets. Loss of coolant flow under such operating conditions will result in destruction of the lead and possible damage to the magnet itself. A flow instability, which results in loss of coolant flow, can occur in current leads due to the dependence of the kinematic viscosity of the coolant on the local temperature. This paper discusses the physical basis of the instability and presents an analysis which is used to describe the operation of current leads used in the EPRI-MIT 2000 kVA superconducting alternator. Details of the lead design and test results are included."
"We have developed an analytical model of a dense, supercritical helium-cooled superconductor, stabilized to withstand short-term instabilities. The model allows for the absorption of energy from transient instabilities and Joule heating during current sharing. Coolant heat transfer parameters are optimized with respect to geometry and superconductor critical temperatures. Data is presented to demonstrate the advantages of a novel extended surface conductor bundle. This work has been directed at large, high-field magnets in the 5 to 9 Tesla range. Conceptual designs of a toroidal \"Tokamak\" coil of 6 meter minor diameter and a 10 m. long × 2.5 m. diameter saddle-wound \"MHD\" magnet are presented."
"The use of penetrating radiation such as X-rays or high energy electrons to cause quenching of a superconducting short across an inductive energy store, thereby switching the persistent current into an external load, is examined. The basic equations describing this process within the two-fluid model are presented, and estimates of the size of megampere switches are made. The ratio of switching energy to switched energy is derived, and X-ray vs. electron impact quenching is discussed. Several geometries for practical switches are presented."
"For several years, members of this Laboratory, in cooperation with the Neurosurgical Service at Massachusetts General Hospital, have been engaged in a research program directed toward the perfection and use of a magnetically guided catheter system for use in the cerebrovascular system. Until recently, this work was carried out using a conventional iron-core, water-cooled electromagnet. This paper describes the design, construction, and operating parameters of a superconducting magnet system for medical use. This design was carried out with the idea foremost in mind of producing a neurosurgical tool that was easy to use in a hospital environment. This required the use of a vacuum insulated liquid helium dewar that could operate in any orientation while helium transfer was taking place, and a flexible, vacuum insulated helium transfer line. The system is completely self-contained, the only external connections being to the dc power source for magnet excitation, and 110 vac for housekeeping functions."
"The frequency conversion signal of a Josephson junction operating as an oscillator mixer is not observable when the intermediate frequency is too low. To test experimentally the possibility of phase-locking effects a superconducting point contact oscillating atf_{0} \\sim 9GHz is irradiated with an external radiation of frequency f1between 8 and 18 GHz. The Josephson oscillation level and linewidth are measured as a function of the power level P1of the external signal at f1with\\deltaf = |f_{0}-f_{1}|as a parameter. With large\\deltafvalues, the variations of the Josephson oscillation and linewidth are the consequence of the V-I characteristic modification. With low δf, the operating point in the VIC is in the induced step curvature and the observed variations show that progressive phase looking occurs."
"Experimental evidence for subharmonic, parametric excitation of plasma oscillations in Josephson tunnel junctions is presented. The experiments described are performed by measuring the microwave power necessary to switch a Josephson tunnel junction biased in the zero voltage state to a finite voltage state."
"We have implanted patterns of N+ and/or S+ ions into Mo films so as to produce structures in which two heavily-doped Mo regions with relatively high transition temperature Tcare connected by a short (\\sim 1\\mum) lightly-doped Mo region with lower transition temperature T'c. Near T'cthe lightly-doped region acts as a weak link between the heavily doped regions and passes a supercurrent having an oscillatory \"diffraction pattern\" dependence on magnetic field similar to that of Josephson tunnel junctions."
"The correct specification of superconductor characteristics is of fundamental importance to the performance and optimization of a magnet. This paper presents design criteria for NbTi multifilamentary composite superconductors for large magnets. Expressions are developed relating conductor configuration to current density, magnetic field, superconductor area, temperature, thermal stability criteria, and magnet protection. Optimization of these conductor characteristics in a magnet includes consideration of current density regionalization, or grading, to minimize the required amount of superconductor without impairing performance. Standardization of conductors is proposed."
 "The behaviour of Josephson tunnel junctions is theoretically investigated in order to determine the junction preparation parameters which allow one to obtain a junction, which, when subjected to microwave radiation produces a convenient constant-voltage current step structure at high bias voltages. Major junction characteristics, like geometrical dimensions, normal tunnel resistance RN, critical current Io, are taken into account, as well as various coupling conditions between junction and microwave radiation. Stable Nb-oxide-Pb junctions having various electrical characteristics for rather different geometrical dimensions have been prepared and tested. The experimental results are in good agreement with our calculations."
"The energy stored in the magnetic and electric field near a superconducting point contact is typically the same magnitude as the coupling energy which produces the Josephson effect in the weakly coupled superconductors. These energies are usually of order one electron volt. One consequence of energy storage in both the electric and magnetic field is that the junction can oscillate at a fundamental frequency ω=2eV/hn, where n is an integer. The dynamics of these subharmonic oscillations have been studied for a model in which the magnetic and electric energies are represented as being stored in an inductance and a capacitance respectively. The model was studied numerically for various biasing conditions, and the behavior compared to experimental data. A simple analytic approximation was developed that gives physical insight into the mechanism that creates the subharmonic oscillations. By use of an electrical analog model, we demonstrated that these subharmonic oscillations can phase lock with an externally applied signal."
"A promising method for microwave coupling to thin-film Josephson devices via microstripline techniques has been developed which has significant advantages over more traditional waveguide techniques. In particular, direct determination of intrinsic junction cavity parameters such as the geometrical resonance frequencies and Q values are made practical and compact cryogenic multi-octave microwave holders readily realized. The results of coupling experiments with Pb-Pb oxide-Pb and Nb-Nb oxide-Pb tunnel junctions are discussed and applications of these results to the design and construction of shielded single junction 2e/h devices and small multi-junction arrays are described."
"We consider a current biased, resistively shunted josephson junction irradiated at two frequencies. The perturbation technique introduced by Aslamasov and Larkin is used in the calculations. Both signals are treated as perturbations. The second order calculation yields the size of the mixing steps atV_{\\pm}=h(\\omega_{1}\\pm\\omega_{2})/2e. As in the case of a single frequency we show that subharmonic mixing steps are absent. The amplitude of the voltage oscillation at the difference and sum frequencies is shown to be non-zero at all voltages. We calculate the microwave resistance for one frequency ω2to third order in the perturbation. There are negative resistance regions nearV\\pm(as well as nearV_{2}= h\\omega_{2}/2e). Near V, the negative resistance region appears for bias voltage V just aboveV_{-}, while near V the region appears for V just belowV_{+}. This means that when an incident frequency mixes with a cavity mode the mixing step atV_{-}will be inverted compared to the cavity step itself."
"A new way to use Josephson junctions for parametric amplification with phase control is proposed. The dc current bias of the junction is adjusted such that the Josephson oscillation automatically synchronizes with the input signal and oscillates at twice the signal frequency with the proper relative phase. The impedance of the junction then has a negative resistive component which can be used for amplification. Extension to other phase sensitive circuits is also discussed."
"Previous experiments have shown that a Josephson oscillator, exposed to a weak narrow-band input signal, exhibits behavior characteristic of an injection-locked oscillator. When in lock, Adler's theory of injection locking describes the experimental observations reasonably well. This paper extends the range of applicability of the theory to the out-of-lock regime where a spectrum of output frequencies is observed. Obtaining the theoretical output power spectrum requires solving a differential equation having the same form as the equation describing the resistively shunted junction model of Stewart and of McCumber. Experimental measurements of the output spectrum of a nearly locked Josephson oscillator are shown to be in reasonable agreement with the theory. Additional results discussed briefly include the observation of a frequency dependence of the locked Josephson oscillator output, and experiments in which a Josephson oscillator-mixer was injection locked by a weak signal at the if."
"We have recently shown that point contact Josephson junctions can function as millimeter wave heterodyne mixers with conversion gain. The best results achieved thus far show a single sideband conversion gain of 1.3 and a mixer contribution to the system noise temperature of 54K. Both of these results are ∼ 5 times better than the best published figures for cooled Schottky barrier diode mixers operated at the same frequency. The measured noise for a variety of junctions can be expressed as a universal function of the normalized rf frequency\\Omega = \\hbar \\omega/2eI_{c}R. It is about a factor 2 larger than the calculated noise arising from the thermal noise in the junction shunt resistance R. The noise calculation was done for the resistively shunted junction model using an analog junction simulator."
"The parametric nature of supercurrent in Josephson junctions may be exploited for amplification of high frequency signals in several modes of operation, where in each case the reactance variation is provided by the internal oscillations due to the average contact potential, a)One mode is negative resistance amplification with a single idler. This mode is entirely equivalent to that generally employed in conventional parametric amplifiers with varactor diodes. b)Negative resistance amplification with several idlers at further combination frequencies. This mode of operation is typical for the resistively shunted junction model, c)Amplification by upconversion, which is conceptually employed in the rf SQUID used in magnetometry. Experimental verifications of these various modes are described and their suitability for low noise amplification discussed. The upconverter experiment permitted the measurement of device noise by variation of the temperature of the input termination. An upper noise limit of 15°K is established. This experiment demonstrates that in high frequency application of active self-oscillating Josephson junctions the fundamental noise achievable is not greatly in excess of the thermal limit."
"It is now possible to develop a new class of receivers for the millimeter and shorter wavelength region by application of Josephson and other electron tunneling phenomena which occur in superconducting materials. This development represents a major advance in receiver sensitivity and will be applicable over a wide frequency interval. Operating in the conventional heterodyne detection mode this receiver has a theoretical noise temperature as low as 20 Kelvin at 100 GHz. Three basic components required are: a superconductor-semiconductor Schottky diode mixer; a Josephson junction phase-locked multiplier local oscillator; and a Josephson parametric amplifier. The component and system design and limiting factors will be discussed."
"\"Tool maker, stacker of wheat.. Flinging magnetic curses amid the toil of piling job upon job.\" Anybody who has had a magnet quench on him knows what Carl Sandburg meant when he wrote of Chicago. The question before all of us today is: Can we lick the magnetic curses and really apply superconductivity? Certainly the wider the range of properties that superconductors have the more chance there is of success. The first portion of the paper will be concerned with the range of intrinsic properties: the critical temperatures (Tc), critical fields (Hc), and critical currents (Jc) In the latter part we will discuss the fabrication of superconducting materials into composite wires or cables in forms suitable for producing magnets, generators, transmission lines, and some of the other devices that are the subject of this meeting. Structures concerned with nonpower-related applications such as Josephson junction devices unfortunately are beyond the present scope."
"During the past five years, several very large superconducting bubble chamber and spark chamber magnets have become operational. The economic and other factors which have led to the construction of large superconducting solenoid magnets for high energy physics research are discussed, and the technological development which made these magnets possible is summarized. Much of the recent development work on superconducting magnets for high energy physics has been directed toward the next generation of accelerators and beam storage rings. Here the goal is to develop dipole and quadrupole magnets of high field precision, low cost, high reliability, capability for slow pulsing, and minimal sensitivity to radiation heating. The status of this work and its application to future accelerators is described. Also, the application of superconducting rf cavities for linear accelerators and particle separation is reviewed briefly."
"Economics has been the single most important factor in determining the future of any new commercial technology in the United States. This criterion is in need of serious examination in view of the projected sharply increasing consumption of energy in the next few decades, particularly in the form of electricity. In order to make a smooth and meaningful transition from conventional methods of generating and transmitting electricity, a coordinated effort between all segments of the private and public domains will be required. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) should play a vital role in planning for both the imminent short term, and long term national electrical energy needs; and in coordinating efforts to achieve these vital goals. If, as predicted, the U. S. power consumption increases by more than a factor of six in the next 30 years, it should be clear that it is necessary to develop high power density methods of producing and transmitting electricity. Superconductivity is the natural prime candidate for a new feasible technology that can take on this responsibility."
 "Presents the front cover/table of contents for this issue of the periodical."
"Dayem bridge Josephson junctions have been successfully fabricated for the first time from sputtered thin films of high-TcNb3Ge. Microwave induced current steps have been observed in the IV characteristic of one of these junctions at a frequency of 10 GHz at temperatures between 20.9 and 21.0K. This junction was fabricated by a mechanical scribing technique instead of sputter etching. Sputter etched junctions also exhibited Josephson steps, but only at much lower temperatures, due to a depression of Tcby the sputter etching process."
"Techniques for constructing a superconducting thin-film particle detector have been developed. Detecting surfaces were fabricated by evaporating a 500 Å tinindium film on a glass cover slide and scratching to obtain a 1 micron strip. At a point just below the Tcand at current densities near Ic, pulses due to single incident Ar, Ar+, He, and He+ particles were observed. Pulses were observed for helium and argon down to 200 eV and 150 eV respectively and up to approximately 800 eV. The response of the detector to ions and neutral particles was identical with near 100% efficiency. Calculated values for the size of normal regions of the film due to incident particles were of the same order of magnitude as those measured. Pulse height analysis indicated no dependence on incident particle energy. It was concluded that this lack of pulse height dependence on incident energy was due to an intrinsic fluctuation phenomenon of the superconducting film."
"Sputtering techniques have been used to fabricate Nb3Ge films on amorphous substrates which exhibit superconductivity up to about 21 K. Of the many sputtering parameters that can be varied, the most important appear to be target geometry and composition and substrate temperature. Initial results of analyzing the composition indicate that a Ge-rich phase nucleates during the initial stages of the deposition. Josephson microbridges have been fabricated from these films and microwave-induced steps in the I-V curves have been observed in micron-sized bridges. An interpretation of the criticality of the bridge size in terms of a vortex state is given."
"In the course of developing the refrigeration system for the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory energy doubler, a new concept was developed for the cooling of long, superconducting magnet systems. The concept depends on: a) the use of pumps for the transport of liquid helium and refrigeration, and b) heat transfer between a stream of boiling helium and one of subcooled liquid helium for maintenance of a constant temperature of the fluid surrounding the magnet windings. In order to verify the validity of the concept an experimental program at Fermilab was started. This paper describes the experimental installation and some of the test results obtained during a number of test runs."
"A short summary of the theory of Josephson tunneling in the presence of a time-dependent voltage is given. It is shown that neither the reactive part of the quasiparticle current nor the cosine term contributes directly to the time-averaged current. However, non-zero frequency components of these two terms can interact with a circuit in such a way as to alter the voltage and therefore the time-averaged current arising from the quasiparticle and sine terms. The importance of the reactive part of the quasiparticle and cosine terms is considered briefly at high frequencies."
"We investigate the time-dependent behaviour of the variable-thickness bridges (VTB) and give expressions for the excess current, for theV \\cos \\varphiterm and for the upper frequency boundary of the Josephson effect. We discuss the validity of the results obtained for different weak links: cross-scribed bridges, proximity effect bridges and whiskers. On the basis of previous analysis the properties of memory element QUANTRON are studied. Then it is shown that the properties of many-terminal bridges allow one to combine high parameters of an externally-pumped down-converter and the simplicity of a self-pumped down-converter."
"The details of the Josephson effect in thin metal bridges are difficult to derive quantitatively, and many papers have been written on the subject attempting to describe quantitatively such qualitative features as irreversible phase slip, instantaneous 2π phase slip, variation of order parameter in time and space, Bernoulli effect, and others. It does not seem to be generally recognized that all of these qualitative features are universal attributes of the Josephson effect and occur also in tunnel junctions. In addition, when a steady voltage is impressed across a junction, a term in the electric field is set up (in addition to the Bernoulli field) which has a rather complex temporal and spatial variation."
"We have reduced the self-heating of microbridges by attaching the actual thin (0.1 μm) bridge to a thick (1 μm) film. Two different fabricating procedures have been followed, based on scratching with a diamond point. Contrary zo expectation, based on previous experimental evidence, Sn microbridges as long as 0.7 μmand 1 μm wide were found to show microwave (9 and 35 GHz) induced steps, periodically varying with power, in a temperature interval 0.3 < T/Tc< 0.97. Good results were also obtained with Al. These results support the idea that previous experiments by various authors have been considerably influenced by self-heating, not taken into account in their interpretation of the results, and that it is possible to use microbridges for device applications at temperatures far below Tc."
"We have measured the noise power spectrum of tin films evaporated on glass substrates biased at the transition temperature. The spectrum is close to 1/f between 0.1 and 1000 Hz. The noise is found to be correlated over a correlation length (D/πf)1/2, where D is the diffusivity of tin film. We have also studied samples in which a thin layer of aluminum was predeposited before tin evaporation. The aluminum layer appears to greatly reduce the thermal boundary resistance between tin and the substrate. The amplitude of noise for such samples is greatly reduced below 10 Hz, where it is almost independent of frequency. These results are in accord with the thermal diffusion theory proposed by Clarke and Voss. They should have important implications on future construction of superconducting bolometers."
"Audio frequency noise density measurements have been performed on weakly superconducting proximity effect bridges using a cooled transformer and room temperature low noise preamplifier. The noise temperature of the measuring system is approximately 4°K for a 0.9Ω resistor. Noise density was measured as a function of bias current and temperature for the bridges. Excess noise above that expected from Johnson noise for a resistor equal to the dynamic resistance of the bridges, was observed in the region near the critical current of the device. At high currents, compared to the critical current, the noise density closely approaches that given by Johnson noise."
"Using a high resolution SQUID voltmeter, we have measured the spectrum of low frequency voltage fluctuations across a thin-film Josephson tunnel junction biased at a constant current I greater than the junction critical current Ic. We find that the frequency dependence of the voltage spectrumV^{2}(f)may be accurately represented by the power lawV^{2}(f) \\propto f^{-1}over the frequency range of our data:10^{-2} < f < 10Hz. The dependence of the magnitude of the spectra at any single frequency upon the value of the bias current I and upon the sample temperature T supports our hypothesis that the observed voltage fluctuations arise from a modulation of the junction critical current Icby equilibrium, thermodynamic temperature fluctuations in the active junction volume. We are able to interpret our measurements in terms of the semi-empirical theory of Clarke and Voss for the low frequency fluctuation spectrum of systems obeying a diffusion equation. This interpretation provides design criteria which may prove useful in reducing the level of long-term drifts in systems employing Josephson tunnel junctions."
"To understand the sputtering process as a means of producing high Tcmetastable superconducting compounds we have investigated the need for thermalization of the sputtered atoms as they are deposited on the substrate. We have used low pressure RF sputtering to produce Nb3Ge with Tcof ∼ 22°K for pressures of 20 mtorr Kr and for 45 mtorr Ar. To test the hypothesis that a thermalization is required to effect a high Tcin Nb3Ge we have been studying the sputtering process for systems such as Nb3Al where Kr is used to thermalize the Nb atoms with the minimum number of collisions and an admixture of Ne is used to optimally thermalize the Al atoms. A computer simulation of the sputtering process aids in the choice of optimum parameters. If the thermalization hypothesis is correct then co-evaporation should be able to produce high TcNb3Ge."
"Alloy samples of Nb and Ge were prepared by simultaneous R. F. sputtering of composite Nb-Ge targets onto heated alumina substrates. The variation of the superconducting transition temperature Tcand the X-ray properties of these specimens were studied as a function of the alloy composition, in the neighborhood of Nb3Ge. The variation of the sputtering parameters, i.e., the self bias voltage, the sputtering gas pressure and the substrate temperature was also studied. Results indicate that high Tcoccur for well-ordered stochiometric Nb3Ge alloys. It was also found that the competing tetragonal phases are promoted by the highly energetic atoms i.e. at high sputtering rates. The relative sticking probability of Ge is important at the higher substrate temperatures."
"We present a review of the superconducting, metallurgical and synthesis properties of Nb3Ga which are important for its potential application. The superconducting properties to be discussed are Tc, Hc2(T) and the dc critical current Jc(H). Special metallurgical features of the Nb-Ga system which put severe constraints on synthesis techniques of potential practical importance for this material are discussed. Superconductivity data for materials synthesized by the techniques of quenching and annealing, chemical vapor deposition and vacuum co-evaporation are reviewed. Recent results on the effects of radiation damage and its recovery by annealing are reviewed."
"The superconducting properties of bulk films(0.02- 0.06 mm thick) of Nb3Ge deposited on Cu substrates by chemical vapor deposition have been studied along with physical parameters characterizing these deposits. Results of susceptibility measurements showing superconducting onsets greater than 21 K and resistivity measurements showing onset greater than 22 K are presented along with heat capacity measurements. Data are also presented defining a relationship between superconducting transition temperature and lattice spacing throughout the range of 4 - 21 K. In addition, the effects of substrate temperature and substrate material, as well as mechanical properties such as substrate adherence are described."
 "High quality Nb-Al-Ge and Nb-Al superconductor deposits, up to 1 mm thick, were made at a rate of 1 μm/min using high-rate sputtering techniques. High-rate sputtering eliminates most of the fabrication problems generally encountered with these materials. Reasonable quantities of high-field superconductors can be made at acceptable cost for practical applications by high-rate sputtering. Highly reflective metallic mirror surfaces on these deposits indicate a high quality, even in thicknesses up to 1 mm. The deposits were completely free of voids and they did not seem to be overly brittle either before or after heat treatment. Crystal structures for deposits made at 20°C were not clearly defined, but probably were body-centered-cubic (bcc). Heat treatment between 550°C and 850°C completely transformed the bcc deposits to extremely small (350 Å) grains of the A-15 crystal structure. The A-15 phase formed by heat treatment for 1 hr to 5 days at 750°C was metastable and supersaturated with Al and Ge. Deposition and heat conditions for decomposition of the metastable A-15 phase were identified. The highest critical temperatures (18°K) were observed only in those deposits containing undecomposed metastable A-15 phase. To assess practical use of the sputtered superconductors, 1- to 2-m lengths of ribbon and filamentary Nb-Al-Ge superconductor were produced on ribbon and wire substrates. It also was found that an excellent superconductor-stabilizer bond can be formed by high-rate sputter deposition of copper stabilizer onto heat-treated Nb-Al-Ge and Nb-Al superconductors."
"Nb3Al wire which is essentially all A15 may be fabricated by powder or rod composite techniques, with subsequent reaction and ordering anneals. Several of the previously existing problems, including aluminum loss and Kirkendall porosity, have been identified and solved, and transverse-field critical current densities well into the 105amp/cm2range can be produced. However, reproducibility of the critical current density seems to depend on reproducible control of grain size, which we have not as yet achieved. The internal oxidation techniques which succeed for Nb3Sn do not appear to work for Nb3Al, for several reasons. A possible solution to the grain size problem, and to the problem of manufacture of Nb3Al in stabilized form, is to lower the initial reaction temperature. To achieve the latter we have reduced the scale of the elemental composite to a required diffusion distance of about 3000 Å. before reaction. We were thus able to produce substantial quantities of A15 at 1100°C, but for several reasons (see text) we believe finer composites will be necessary."
"The accomplishments and the prospects of forming A15 superconductors using electron beam evaporation are reviewed. The techniques of monitoring and controlling the evaporation are discussed. The special advantages to the synthesis of A15 materials are pointed out, followed by a number of examples. The prospect of the large scale production of A15 superconductors using electron beam processing is also considered."
"Solid solution alloys of niobium with concentrations of Sn from 1 to 9 wt% have been prepared by quenching the solid solution from about 2100°C to room temperautre. These materials are relatively ductile and can be deformed, by swaging, into the desired shape, after which the material is reacted at about 800°c. The resulting structure is a mixture of Nb3Sn and Nb, with as much as 45% of the volume containing Nb3Sn."
"The components (insulation, stabilization material and the superconductor) of a superconducting coil system for a fusion reactor are exposed to fast neutrons, probably with a dose of about 1018n/cm2during the lifetime of a reactor, and with an energy spectrum comparable with the one of a fission reactor. Experimental investigations were made on the influence of low temperature neutron irradiation on the stability of a superconductor and of the superconducting properties of NbTi wires with different initial jc and pre-treatment. The influence on jcand Tcof Nb3Sn was investigated."
"The characteristics of a new superconducting wire material, consisting of a 7 μm carbon filament substrate thinly coated with niobium carbonitride, are reported. These filaments are coated (∼ 1000 at a time as a yarn) by a co-CVD process in which the desired carbonitride is deposited as a compound. Several coating compositions from NbC to NbC.75N.15have been studied. At each composition several coating thicknesses from 300 to 3000 Å were prepared. Although our present coating compositions are not near NbC0.3N0.7, which has previously been determined as optimum for this pseudobinary system, we nevertheless have obtained excellent superconducting properties. Zero-field critical current densities of 2 × 106A/cm2in the coating have been obtained, and there is no discernable ac loss at frequencies up to 50 kHz. In addition to the superconducting measurements we have also performed chemical, x-ray diffraction, and electron microscopic analyses on the coated filaments."
"Results of x-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, critical field(Hc2) and transport measurements are presented and discussed for bulk amorphous and microcrystalline transition metal alloys obtained by liquid quenching. The transition temperature of the alloys is in the range 1.5 to 4.7°K. It is observed that Jc-Hc2-Tcrelations are rather simple for this class of material. These relations are compared with the theories of type II superconductors whereever possible. The high resistance of bulk metallic glass to radiation damage might render them suitable for magnetic field applications in high radiation environments."
"The effect of high energy neutron (E>1 MeV) irradiation at 60°C on the superconducting critical temperature, Tc, the upper critical field, Hc2, the lattice parameter, ao, and the degree of Long Range Order has been measured for Nb and V based A-IS superconducting compounds. Large reductions in Tc, and Hc2are observed for fluences up to 5.0 × 1019n/cm2. For Nb3Al aoincreases and the degree of Long Range Order is significantly reduced as Tcis depressed. The results are discussed in terms of atomic ordering in the A-15 structure."
"NbTi and Nb3Sn multifilamentary composites have been irradiated with fast-neutrons at 60 ± 5°C to fluences of 1.2×1020n/cm2(E > 1 MeV). The NbTi samples show only a moderate reduction of Icas a function of neutron fluence in an applied field of 40 kG. Reductions in Icwere observed for fluences greater than 3 × 1017n/cm2and saturate at 18% for fluences greater than 3-4 × 1019n/cm2. The Nb3Sn composites showed large neutron radiation induced changes in Tc, Icand Hc2. Reductions in Tcwere observed for fluences greater than 7 × 1017n/cm2. No measurable changes in Ic(40 kG) were observed below 1018n/cm2. Between 2 and 3×1018n/cm2, however, there is an apparent threshold where a very rapid reduction in Ic(40 kG) is initiated. At the threshold the decrease in Tcis 13%. Between the threshold and 1.1 × 1019n/cm2, I2(40 kG) has been reduced to 4% of the unirradiated value. These changes in superconducting properties in NbTi and Nb3Sn are analyzed in terms of the radiation induced defects. The impact of the response to irradiation of both materials on their applications in fusion reactor magnets is discussed."
"The object of this work was to estimate the effects of neutron irradiation at 77K on commercial stabilized superconductor wires. Irradiation doses of 1018to 1019fast neutrons per cm2were explored and the critical current measured in magnetic fields extending from 2 to 8 Teslas. A reduction in the critical Current density, depending on the type of the conductor was observed and for the single core wire a decrease of the take off voltage indicates a loss of stability."
"To study the effects of low temperature irradiation on technological type II-superconductors, NbTi and V3Ga multifilamentary composite wires, the critical current Icand the transition temperature Tcwere measured before and after irradiation with 50 MeV deuterons at 10 K and 15 K, respectively. While the irradiation effects on Icand Tcof NbTi are substantially unaffected, the V3Ga wires undergo a reduction in Icof about 50 % and Tcdecreases from 14.7 ± 0.1 K to 12.3 ± 0.1 K at a total deuteron flux of 2.7 × 1017cm-2. Annealing experiments at room temperature and 100° C show only a small recovery of the superconducting properties up to 15 %. The field dependence of the volume pinning force densities Pvwas determined and the results are shown to be consistent with a qualitative dynamic pinning model."
"The \"ac\" losses in normal metal sheaths around superconductor composites are calculated. Three cases are considered: (1) the composite region is assumed to have a finite constant resistance, (2) flux lines are assumed to move from the normal metal into the superconductor at constant velocity, and (3) complete equations of motion and continuity of flux are used in both the normal and superconductor region. Case (1) is incorrect since it predicts a decrease In losses for an increase in rate of change of applied magnetic field, in contradiction to case (3). Case (3) is, of course, complete and accurate but complex enough to require numerical solutions. Case (2) however is only in error by a few percent for charging rates in the order of one tesla/h. Case (3) can be applied for any charging rate as long as the superconductor filaments are transposed, not just twisted."
"The recent report that Nb3Ge films can be prepared with superconducting transition temperatures of over 22K has immediately made Nb3Ge a very important potential candidate for a variety of large scale applications, such as for example, power transmission lines, or large high field magnets. Short sample data on sputtered films show that Nb3Ge possesses an extremely attractive combination of high field properties, competitive with any other presently known material at all temperatures from zero to Tc. The development of a process capable of being used to fabricate Nb3Ge in a useful configuration (i.e., long length of wire or tape) is now being investigated. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a demonstrated commercial process, which may be applicable for this purpose. Our initial CVD studies have yielded films with Tc's over 21.5K."
"Transport and magnetization measurements have been made on 6μ, 720 filament niobium carbonitride yarn. The magnetization data is discussed in terms of the hysteretic loss, the temperature dependence of Jc, the matrix-superconductor bond quality and the doping effects on the high field Jc's. Transport properties are compared to properties obtained from magnetization data. In addition, weak coupling has been investigated in low conversion fibers. The V-I curves show numerous voltage steps, some corresponding to an order of magnitude increase in resistivity."
"Following an extensive study of cryogenic power transmission systems under development in this country and abroad it was concluded at Brookhaven that a flexible superconducting ac cable appeared to be the best choice for an economical high-capacity underground system with superior technical characteristics. A form of niobium-tin has been developed for this application with an intrinsic low-loss performance at 60 Hz. In addition, it has been determined that the ac characteristics of many commercial forms of Nb3Sn are degraded by additives, these effects are described. A flexible cable will require a lapped plastic insulation which must possess necessary properties both at room temperature and at the operating temperature, these are listed together with a summary of test results. Several designs for the cryogenic envelope to contain the cable are under development, the design options and trade-offs are discussed. Using performance data based on present knowledge of helium-cooled cables, systems were designed for an actual utility company transmission corridor 43 miles long rated at 4800 MVA. These designs are costed and compared to conventional transmission facilities."
 "This review will sketch the present state of affairs in applications of Josephson junctions and SQUIDs to: magnetometry, DC and RF metrology, detection and amplification of electromagnetic signals, frequency metrology, noise thermometry and computers. It will also mention recent progress in super-stable oscillators using superconducting resonant circuits, pulse transmission lines, and thin-film deviees to detect radiation or charged particles. Many of these topics are maturing nicely."
"Various applications of sc magnets are pursued in our country. Development in nuclear physics, especially new developments for dc and pulsed superconducting beam line magnets are reported. Research work on magnets for plasma and fusion physics concentrates on systems studies, toroidal systems, and energy storage devices and will become one of the most challenging fields for magnet builders in the future. Industrial applications of sc magnets are investigated for high speed transportation systems, sc machinery and magnetic separation devices. Programs and results are discussed."
"The TMLV Technology Program is concerned with the use of magnetic levitation for suspension of high-speed ground vehicles traveling at speeds of 480 km/h. The program is configured to permit comparative evaluation of two competing MAGLEV concepts -- repulsion and attraction. The program has two major tasks: conceptual design of a passenger-carrying system which meets a specified ride quality objective, and design and test of a high-speed (480 km/h) rocket-propelled test vehicle capable of providing engineering data relevant to the aforementioned conceptual design. The high-speed tests will be carried out at the Naval Weapons Center, China Lake, California. This paper will discuss both parts of the program, with emphasis on the superconducting magnets used in the levitation/guidance systems."
"The use of high field superconducting d.c. magnets in cyclotron design makes possible accelerators that are small and consequently have a significant cost advantage over comparable iron-magnet cyclotrons. A general description of superconducting isochronous cyclotrons is given, with emphasis on the magnet design requirements. Saturated iron poles to provide flutter focussing are described. A conceptual design for a heavy ion energy booster cyclotron for a tandem Van de Graaff is described, similar cyclotrons for production of proton or deuteron primary beams and π mesons or neutron secondary beams can, in view of the low cost, be considered for dedicated applications such as activation analysis or cancer therapy."
"The opportunities and limitations of the applications of superconductors in rotating electric machines are given. The relevant properties of superconductors and the fundamental requirements for rotating electric machines are discussed. The current state-of-the-art of superconducting machines is reviewed. Key problems, future developments and the long range potential of superconducting machines are assessed."
"Applications of superconductivity will be needed in each of the three magnetic confinement systems being developed in the AEC controlled thermonuclear research program. Fusion plasmas must be confined by magnetic fields instead of solid walls. The tokamak and magnetic mirror confinement systems will need superconducting magnets to produce the confining magnetic field. The theta-pinch confinement system will need superconducting energy storage coils and homopolar machines to provide energy for pulsed magnetic fields. The AEC is supporting developments for these three systems but it is not yet known which magnetic confinement systems will be used in fusion power reactors. The technology problems associated with these applications of superconductivity are described in the paper."
"Lift and drag forces are compared for various null and normal flux superconducting magnet configurations where each coil consists of a pair of infinitely long parallel wires separated by a fixed distance. The nullflux configuration has a minimum in the drag to lift ratio for a particular value of I2/W (I=magnet current, W=vehicle weight) when the vehicle cruises freely at constant speed. This calculation takes into account losses due to non-uniform eddy-current density distribution in the solid track. Results indicate that the null-flux configuration is the most efficient design, followed by the normal-flux, single track configuration. All other schemes are less efficient for a thin track configuration. A general method is outlined for calculating the zero-torque case."
"The resistive state of a superconducting film can be induced either by passing sufficient current along the film or by raising the temperature above Tc. We have been studying this transition in aluminum films when they are injected with \"hot\" (i.e. nonthermal) phonons and electrons. This injection efficiently breaks electron pairs in the region near the injection point. These \"hot\", electrons and phonons are produced by tunnel junctions which incorporate or are adjacent to the Al film under study. This method of current injection usually results in significantly lower critical currents than the critical current measured conventionally along the film. Well-defined and reproducible critical currents together with I-V traces for the Al film, which under certain conditions are characterized by a series of constant current voltage steps, have been obtained with a variety of geometrical configurations and different tunnel junction resistances."
"Some of the problems encountered in constructing superconducting switches for magnetic energy storage systems are discussed. Empirical rules are given which assure that a switch is driven fully normal when triggered, and some of the possible geometrical arrangements for switches are considered. Results of energy transfer experiments from 20 kJ and 300 kJ superconducting energy storage systems using superconducting switches are given."
"Although magnetic separation may become the first industrial application of superconductivity, its advantages do not appear to be as great as many of us had anticipated."
"This paper describes the construction and performance of several small solenoids wound from filamentary composite wires produced by A.E.R.E., Harwell, U.K. The Nb3Sn is formed in the wire after winding by a high temperature treatment. The maximum field obtained was 12.2 Tesla, produced by placing a 9.9 Tesla Nb3Sn solenoid in the backing field of a 6.5 Tesla Nb-Ti solenoid. The working current densities are substantially greater than those obtained with Nb-Ti."
"Initial operational characteristics of a wind tunnel electromagnetic balance utilizing superconducting coils are reported. Both d.c. and a.c. superconducting coils are used for balancing and measuring 3-component aerodynamic forces on simple models in Mach 3, room temperature flow. Liquid helium boil-off measurements corresponding to a wide range of operating conditions are presented together with results of systematic a.c. losses scaling experiments using various pancake coils wound with superconducting tape. This unique prototype facility is primarily for studying the practical feasibility of using superconducting magnetic suspension techniques for aerodynamic testing and accumulating the knowledge and expertise required for extrapolating these techniques to large-scale facilities."
"With the help of careful measurements of the terminal voltage appearing across a noninductive winding of Nb-Ti wire we have studied the influence of oscillating magnetic fields on the transport current. It is possible to discuss the voltage versus oscillating field characteristics in terms of the critical state model, and good agreement with experimental data has been achieved. The analysis shows that the voltage measurement gives some detailed information on the distribution of the magnetic induction inside the superconductor. An effective resistance Reffappears in the transport current loop when the amplitude of the oscillating field exceeds a certain threshold value. The dependence of Reffon amplitude and frequency of the oscillating field and on the wire diameter is discussed and the application of this analysis to the case of superconducting solenoids is outlined briefly."
"The transmission behaviour of NbTi-foils, NbTi-multifilament wires in CuNi-matrix and of NbN-sputtering sheets have been investigated and compared under different switching modes. Suitability for switching of 50 Hz-a.c. current has been proofed. Based on the results at 1200 A switch for a 12 kJ-superconducting storage coil which was the basic step in a project for the development of superconducting storage systems has been built. The switching time with and without load current has been investigated for different amplitude of current pulses."
"The instantaneous and integrated voltages detected between pairs of diametrically opposite contacts attached on the periphery of superconducting Nb tubes of different wall thicknesses were monitored as flux threading the walls and the hole is caused to change. For a chosen change of flux, the signals across a pair of contacts were found to depend dramatically on the configuration of leads to the contacts relative to the direction of flux motion. The persistent currents induced to flow azimuthally around the walls of the cylinder are made to collapse partially or completely and the flux retained in or shielded from the hole and the wall is made to exit or enter by applying heat at a narrow strip along the length of the tube. The numerous observations are consistent with the following picture. Changes of flux in the hole or in the walls generate a voltage only across the leads which embrace the region where entry or exit of flux occurs (only changes of magnetic flux in the measuring circuit excluding the superconducting volume contribute)."
"We have measured the critical current of several superconductors to 24 kA in magnetic fields to 4.5 T. The samples were hairpin shaped with the straight section under test in a perpendicularly applied field. The proximity of the straight parts causes the field of the current in one leg to change the applied field in the other leg. We have corrected the measured results for this adjacent conductor field (ACF). These corrections result in data for uniform applied fields. One conductor was used in a 300 kJ magnet. This single-layer, edge-wound coil was rated near 9.8 kA using the uniform field data. Under test the magnet reached 12.5 kA giving no sign of approaching the critical current. The \"excess current\" is due to the field gradient across the conductor in this coil. One contribution is due to the variation of jcwith the field value within the conductor. A second contribution results from the position dependent anisotropy of the filaments. A third possibility is to change the definition of Ic. We have chosen the definition to be the current at which the sample generates an electric field of 3.5 μV/m. If 46 μV/m were chosen, Icwould rise approximately 0.86 kA at 17 kG."
"A gravimeter has been developed which uses the levitation of a superconducting sphere by the field of persistent current magnets. Instabilities in the field have been reduced to the point where environmental noise on local gravity is greater than the instrument noise. In present results the persistent currents are decaying at a rate of 2 parts in 107/yr. Concurrent measurements of magnetic field and gravimeter signal allows for correction of this drift. The device is being applied to geophysical problems through measurements of: secular variations in local gravity, tides of the solid earth, effects of oceans and atmosphere on local gravity, and normal modes of the earth."
"Recent developments in superconducting magnetic gradiometer technology have led to the construction of advanced ultrasensitive gradiometer/magnetometer arrays. Details of construction techniques and data showing operational capabilities are presented. The most recent of the gradiometer/magnetometer arrays simultaneously measures five independent spatial gradients of the magnetic field and three vector components of the magnetic field. The measured signals from this array are subjected to a novel signal processing technique which provides detailed information about the magnetic signal source."
"While a great deal of attention has been paid to two-pole superconducting synchronous machines, very little analysis of low speed, multipole superconducting synchronous machines has been done. Such machines may prove desirable as drive motors in ship drive systems. This paper presents the results of an analysis which assumes a motor of sufficient size that the airgap may be considered to be flat. A power output expression is given which shows the effects of machine geometry and superconductor characteristics on machine size. Based on this expression, a 40,000 hp 120 rpm motor is sized, and the resulting machine is compared with a conventional ship drive motor. The comparison illustrates possible size reductions through the application of superconductivity."
"The Magneplane is a magnetically propelled and suspended vehicle for high speed ground transportation. The design represents an attractive transportation option applicable to various transportation corridors. The purpose of the paper is to highlight various development efforts associated with the project and to report recent results of the study."
"Standard microelectronic fabrication techniques have been utilized to produce batch quantities of superconducting quantum electronic devices and circuits. The overall goal is a fabrication technology yielding circuits that are rugged and stable and capable of being fabricated controllably and reproducibly in sizeable quantities. Our progress toward this goal is presented, with primary emphasis on the most recent work, which includes the use of electron-beam lithography and techniques of hybrid microelectronics. Several prototype microcircuits have been successfully fabricated. These microcircuits are formed in a thin-film parent material consisting of layers of superconducting and normal metals, and use proximity-effect structures as the active circuit elements."
"A batch fabrication technology is described for the production of small niobium based Josephson junctions. This technology uses thermally oxidized silicon wafers as substrates, allowing maximum usage of silicon integrated circuit techniques and equipment. Patterns are produced in rf sputtered niobium films by sputter etching through masks generated by \"step and repeat\" photolithographic techniques. Typically over 600 junctions are fabricated at one time. Measurements of voltampere curves, Josephson current versus magnetic field, and self resonant step structure were made."
"Characteristics of in-line Josephson gates have been computed, using numerical techniques, for a number of differing junction length to Josephson penetration depth ratios. These are verified by systematic experimental results, where the agreement between theory and experiment was found to be good."
"Transverse alternating field losses at 4.2K have been measured from 0.5 Hz to 10 kHz in a Nb3Sn multifilamentary superconductor in bias fields to 5 Tesla. The 0.020 inch diameter sample was prepared by heat treating a Cu, Nb-1 wt % Zr, CuSn composite at 700°C for 20 hours to form Nb3Sn on the inside surface of the annular filaments. Metallurgical studies have been made to determine the Sn distribution and to estimate the thickness of the Nb3Sn layer. The Ic-H curve and resistive and inductive transition curves are presented. The losses are analyzed with respect to the present loss theories using the conductor characteristics measured and excellent agreement between experiment and theory is achieved."
 "In an attempt to meet the eventual needs of fusion magnets, a multifilamentary Nb3Sn conductor has been proposed consisting of a cabled array of multifilamentary Nb3Sn strands .027 cm in diameter, surrounding a stainless steel core. This cable assembly would be jacketed with soft copper to provide an overall rectangular exterior. For the purpose of testing this concept, a prototype cable was fabricated in a length of several hundred meters. The cable was designed to carry 300 amperes at 12T and have a minimum bending radius of about 6 cm. Fabrication techniques, short sample critical currents and bending test results will be presented, and the problems anticipated in scale up will be discussed."
"Multifilament conductors have been fabricated in several configurations employing various combinations of Cu, Sn, Cu-Sn bronze and Nb. These conductors are in the 8-100 mil size range and contain 400-13,000 filaments. Filament sizes range from 8-100 microns in diameter. Heat treatment studies and their effect upon superconducting properties have been performed for temperatures in the range 600-800°C. Sample evaluation has included measurements of Tc, resistivity and Jcup to 150kG. Mechanical tests to assess allowable bending diameters and metallurgical studies to determine the distribution of constituent elements subsequent to heat treatment have been made. These results will be discussed and compared in the context of optimizing the properties of these conductors for high field magnet applications."
"A three-dimensional close-packed array of Josephson junctions was successfully produced in the form of a bulk granular superconductor. The granular system is a tightly compressed solid of oxide coated small tin particles in the thousand Å range. The three-dimensional array of Josephson junctions thus formed showed coherent Josephson oscillations when external rf radiation was imposed, rf induced constant voltage steps were observed on its I-V characteristics at voltages a few thousand times the Josephson voltage hv/2e. The external rf radiation also induced Stable dc voltages on unbiased bulk samples, suggesting a practical mode of microwave detection. The analogy of this bulk superconducting system with a magnetic spin system will be discussed."
"We report on the characteristics of thin film microbridge Josephson junctions fabricated using electron beam lithography and discuss the techniques used to fabricate these junctions, which are typically 0.3μ square. Extensive measurements have been made on both individual junctions of tin and indium and on small arrays of these junctions. Synchronization of current biased series arrays by an applied microwave field has been achieved. This synchronization appears as a zero differential resistance across the entire array at a voltage of MVJwhere M is the number of elements in series and VJis the Josephson voltage hv/2e. Furthermore we have observed a systematic variation with microbridge dimension of the microwave enhancement of the critical current."
"Magnetization of cabled and braided samples which are long compared to their transposition lengths has been measured in a uniform magnetizing field directed at right angles to their widths. A separated double pancake with nonuniform windings was constructed to produce a suitably uniform radial field in which long coiled samples could be placed. Magnetization losses have also been measured in the ISA I magnet at BNL. Results are compared with theories which are due to Wilson[1] and, basically, Morgan.[2] Also, design optimization procedures have been defined for the use of multistrand conductors in magnet windings."
"We have previously reported damage to two large superconducting solenoids caused by axial expansion forces and radial compression forces. These forces, which can be greater than and are of opposite sense to the classical Lorentz forces, we have attributed to the diamagnetism of the composite superconductors. Some irregularities experienced in the operation of force cooled superconducting magnet systems appear to be readily understood by considering diamagnetic forces. It seems likely that several other previously unexplained occurences in the operation of large superconducting magnets will also eventually be attributed to this effect. We describe how diamagnetic properties of superconducting strips produce repulsive forces on opposite edges of the strips. At the end pancake and innermost layer of a solenoid, these forces are seriously unbalanced and may override the Lorentz forces. We discuss how the magnitude of these forces may be estimated and how their effects may be minimized. We suggest that the stress analysis of large superconducting magnets currently in operation or in design be reviewed to consider the relevance of diamagnetic forces to their safe operation."
"As a result of the predicted savings in weight and volume offered by superconducting field windings, the USAF initiated a technology advancement program on superconducting machines. The initial phase of this program was devoted to the preliminary design and analysis of certain critical components judged to be essential in constructing a high speed, high power superconducting generator suitable for airborne application. As a final feasibility test, the most critical components, i.e., the dynamic cryogenic seals, power leads, and superconducting field winding, were to be assembled into a complete working rotor and tested under full operating conditions. This paper will review the overall design, fabrication and final test results of a prototype 12,000 rpm 4-pole superconducting rotor. The main emphasis will be placed on the design, fabrication and test of the superconducting coils, and on the description of the cryogenic cooling scheme for the 4-pole coil structure."
"Planar series arrays of up to 500 proximity effect superconducting bridges have been fabricated with sufficient uniformity to respond coherently to incident radiation (10-20,000MHz) without separate biasing. By varying the geometry, resistance for the arrays can range from .1-50Ω. Despite this high total impedance, low frequency coherent response to external radiation is limited only by single bridge voltage noise. Low frequency (30-500MHz) coherent internal voltage oscillations of current biased arrays have been detected and confirm that the oscillating voltage signal grows linearly in bridge number while the voltage noise increases only as the square root. An array of n elements responds to incident high frequency radiation in first approximation as though it were a simple Josephson junction but quantized in units of n(h/2e). Coincident operation to high frequency depends strongly on small (\\leq 1\\mu) bridge separation. High resistance, coincident operation, and exponential dependence of critical current on temperature make these arrays good candidates for voltage standards, coherent and bolometric radiation detectors, and cryogenic rf sources."
"A problem is considered of optimizing the following parameters of the single-junction quantum superconducting fluxmeter: 1. The full range output signal of the magnitometer ΔA. 2. The derivative of the signal characteristic\\gamma = |\\frac{\\partialA}{\\partial\\phi_{e}}|3. The minimum detected flux change δφ For the hysteresis case (\\ell=2\\piL_{R}I_{o}\\phi_{o}^{-1} > 1) the following results have been obtained. In the resistive mode (q= wL_{R}R^{-1} < 1) the maximum value ΔA equals (\\phi_{o/2})[\\Delta_{k}Q(\\piL_{R}C_{T}^{-1}]^{1/2}where the maximum value of the function\\Delta_{k}(\\ell)is about unity, when\\ell \\approx 1.5. A satisfactory agreement has been obtained between the measured and calculated dependences of ΔA on k and CTparameters for the fluxmeter having a pumping frequency of about 10 MHz and the high-Q circuit. With detuning\\xi_{o}conditioning either a triangular or trapezoidal waveform pattern, γ is as usually given by\\gamma_{o}=\\frac{w}{k}\\sqrt{\\frac{L_{t}}{L_{R}}}If the detuning is great and negative a signal amplitude may take a rectangular form, and γ in this case is much more larger than γo. The experimentally obtained value\\delta\\phi =10^{-11}Gs.cm2is near enough to the known theoretical estimation. Calculations indicate that for a nonhysteresis case one may have the following formulae:\\gamma_{\\max}/\\gamma_{o} = l/q \\gg 1and(\\delta\\phi)_{\\min} \\simeq 1.2 (L_{R}/\\ell) (4\\Delta fk_{B} T/R)^{1/2}giving(\\delta\\phi)_{\\min}/(\\Deltaf)^{1/2} \\approx 10^{-14}Gs.cm2/\\sqrt{Hz}when\\ell \\approx 1,L_{R}= 10^{-10}H (not taking into account the noise of the amplifier). The magnetometers were employed to search for the electrical dipole moment of the electron in the macroscopic experiment, in low temperature paramagnetic thermometry and also to test the degree of magnetic field shielding with a hollow superconducting screen."
"A descriptive review of some of the familiar and not-so-familiar behavior of Josephson devices was given making use of mechanical analogs. Previously unpublished material on the two-dimensional junction analog and noise properties of the resistively-shunted junction model is given here."
"It is shown both by computer simulations and experimentally that a single Josephson junction has memory and can therefore be used for information storage. Means of reading-out the information content of such a memory element are demonstrated. Finally, memory operation, writing and reading, is described as a direct application of these concepts."
"Planar SQUIDs with a Dayem bridge and two holes have been fabricated by sputter etching NbN thin films deposited epitaxially on MgO substrates and their performance has been tested in a conventional mode of operation at 15 MHz. It has been found that the devices operate with satisfactory reliability and their operating temperature covers over a wide range nearly from the superconducting transition temperature of the basic films e.g.∼15 K down to the pumped liquid helium temperature. The fabrication technique and the result of the performance test are presented, and the bridge characteristics and possible application of the device are discussed from a technical point of view."
"The problem of calculating of the magnetic field in magnets with superconducting shields is considered. As an example of calculating the magnetic field of a rectangular cross section coil with two shields is analyzed. The results are compared with experimental data."
"This paper describes a superconducting power supply (flux pump) of the transformer rectifier type in which the rectification is produced by thermal switching. The supply is intended for use with a superconducting magnet. At an operating current of 1000A the pump can charge a magnet at about 20 W with an efficiency greater than 93%. In separate battery tests the pump has developed 38 W at a current of 1500A. Design of an improved 1500A, 500 W supply is in hand."
"We have developed a superconducting susceptometer operating in temperature range up to 230°K. The instrument is capable of routine susceptibility measurements on frozen solutions and suspensions, powders, crystals; a single helium fill up, lasting about 8 hours, allows about 50 susceptibility measurements at various sample temperatures. Sensitivity is 6 × 10-11e.m.u./cc for a sample volume of 0.5 cc and is independent of temperature. The overall accuracy of the instrument for sample temperatures upto 230°K is 3 × 10-9e.m.u./cc, temperature independent, in a typical applied field of 20 gauss."
"An investigation has been made of the effect of the weak link current-phase relation on noise in rf biased SQUIDs. Non-sinusoidal current-phase relations have been observed in various weak links and these non-sinusoidal relations have been correlated with significantly increased intrinsic noise in the SQUID ring. The current-phase relation is also found to affect the amplitude of the rf SQUID ring dissipation. The result of a rf SQUID system noise analysis shows that, due to increased intrinsic noise and reduced ring dissipation, the minimum attainable noise for a SQUID ring having a very non-sinusoidal current-phase relation is considably greater than for a ring with a sinusoidal relation."
"An inductance bridge has been constructed which operates at zero frequency to compare superconducting inductors. The bridge uses a point contact SQUID as a current null detector. The unknown and standard inductors are at liquid helium temperature, but the bridge is balanced by resistance adjustments at room temperature. The present bridge can detect a change of 1 part in 104in a μH inductance and has various advantages over ac bridges. The bridge can be applied in a number of ways. Currently we are using it to determine the kinetic inductance, penetration depth and critical current of thin film circuits. The bridge is particularly adapted to measuring the quantum phase difference vs current of current-dependent inductances. Susceptibility and precision measurements of inductance are other possible applications. Although the bridge was developed to measure small inductances, the principle can be easily applied to larger inductances and may be useful in large scale applications."
"D.C. SQUIDS of cylindrical geometry have been fabricated using Nb-NbOx-Pb tunnel junctions. The SQUIDs can be thermally cycled repeatedly and cooled in the earth's magnetic field without significant loss of performance. Flux resolution of3 \\times 10^{-5} \\phi_{o}/\\sqrt{Hz}above a frequency of 1 Hz has been achieved through optimization of electronic circuitry and careful shielding. Fluctuations and drift in the temperature of the helium bath are found to be the major source of long-term SQUID noise. With a simple temperature stabilizer, drift has been reduced to less than8 \\times 10^{-5} \\phi_{o}/hr over a three hour period."
"Magnetic fields produced by organs of the human body are being measured in the M.I.T. shielded room, using both a SQUID magnetometer and second-derivative gradiometer. Measurements of the field around the human body can yield new information about the organs which generate current, not available to surface electrodes, and also about organs which contain foreign, ferromagnetic particles. Magnetocardiograms of normal and abnormal heart subjects are being analyzed and visually displayed in order to assess their information content. Magnetoencephalograms recorded from normal and abnormal brain subjects are also under analysis. Measurements have been made of magnetite dust in the lung, with two potential medical applications: the first is the use of pure magnetite dust as a deliberately inhaled tracer (harmless) for pulmonary diagnosis; the second is the assessment of the amount of asbestos accumulated in the lungs of heavily-exposed workers, since most asbestos (harmful) occurs with adhered magnetite."
"Cryogenic direct current comparators, utilizing superconducting shields and Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs), provide current ratios of up to 100/1 or higher with accuracies of\\lsim 1 \\times 10^{-9}and current resolutions of\\lsim 6 \\times 10^{-11}A. Two types of comparators differing in the shielding arrangement of the ratio windings are described. One type consists of unit windings inside a seamless Pb tube; the other consists of multi-turn ratio windings within an overlapping toroidal superconducting shield. For both shielding configurations, SQUIDs serve as flux sensors for the comparators. The application of these comparators to the measurment of resistance ratios is described."
"Studies on the use of superconducting magnets for levitation, synchronous propulsion and guidance of high speed intercity ground transportation in Canada are reported. For a 100 passenger vehicle weighing 300 kN, a levitation height of 22 cms at 480 Km/hr. is obtained by the interaction of eight 3.85 × 105amp turn 100 × 30 cm magnets with eddy currents induced in two 80 × 1 cm aluminum guideway strips. In low speed sections, aluminum thickness is graded to 3 cms to maintain total drag (aerodynamic and magnetic) almost speed independent. The variable speed LSM uses fifty 5 × 105amp turn 40 × 150 cm magnets on a half pitch of 45 cms. The motor, with split 3-phase guideway windings energized in 5 Km block lengths, has 72% efficiency and 0.82 power factor. A favoured guidance scheme for a flat-topped elevated guideway (minimizing snow accumulation) uses the interactions of the propulsion magnets with flat null-flux loops overlying the LSM windings and with the edges of the levitation strips. This scheme produces a lateral stiffness of 106N/m and a maximum guidance force equal to vehicle weight. The Canadian test facility, presently being commissioned, uses full scale magnets and a 7.6 m diameter wheel rotated about a vertical axis with a maximum peripheral speed of 100 Km/hr."
"There is a growing interest in a.c. superconducting machines. Several new concepts have been proposed for these machines in the last years. One of the most promising seems to be the \"three elements\" concept of Pr. Smith, allowing to cancel the torque acting on the superconducting field winding and thus overcoming some of the major contraints. This concept leads to a device of induction-type generator. In the present paper a synchronous three elements superconducting a.c. machine is described, in which a room temperature, d.c. fed rotating winding is inserted between the superconducting field winding and the a.c. armature. The steady-state machine theory is developed. After having the flux linkages established, the torque expressions are derived. The condition for zero torque on the field winding, as well as the resulting electrical equations of the machine are given. In the last part of the paper, the theoretical behaviour of the machine is studied, using phasor diagrams and assuming for the superconducting field winding either a constant current or a constant flux condition."
"We have made and tested 1250Å-thick silicon-barrier Josephson junctions. The junctions tested show supercurrent and have junction characteristics which may be useful for high-frequency applications. A detailed junction fabrication process and the effects of surface oxides on the junction characteristics are described."
"We have investigated the use of Josephson devices as switching components for computer circuits. One part of this work is a study of the switching properties of the superconductor-semiconductor-superconductor junction. The switching speeds of a single junction and a basic memory cell, computed by numerical methods, are comparable with the corresponding values for oxide-barrier junctions. Having a much lower Q than the conventional oxide-barrier junction, it should not have the previously experienced difficulties caused by junction resonances. The damping of plasma oscillations in the semiconductor junction is also more effective, leading to a shorter switching time. A new type of logic gate employing Josephson devices has been investigated. This circuit would automatically unlatch after each operation, thus requiring no external means for resetting. Numerical analysis predicts subnanosecond switch-reset operation for appropraite parameter choices. The qualitative behavior of the circuit has also been shown with a mechanical analog."
"A process is described for the production of Pb(In) - oxide barrier - Pb Josephson tunnel junctions. The junctions are predictable in resistance to within 30%, and have excellent leakage, storage and ageing properties. Critical currents and magnetic behaviour agree well with theory. Investigation of the deposited films by surface techniques shows that the presence of In suppresses the formation of 'hillocks' which occur during annealing and during sputter etching. The distribution of In through the films is investigated by Ion Scattering Spectroscopy, which shows In enrichment at the free surface. There is some, as yet inconclusive, evidence that In plays an important role in the barrier formation (oxidation) process."
 "An integrated loop-memory cell with miniaturized Josephson-junction dimensions (∼5 × 5 μm2) and very high Josephson current density (30 kA/cm2) has been made in a 2 μm-minimum line-width lead-alloy technology. The storage currents are easily set up with coincident word and digit pulses. Nondestructive read-out, write and half selection has been successfully performed. The deduced current transfer time during write is below about 80 ps."
"In order to develop a compact and light-weight superconducting vehicle magnet for a magnetically suspended high speed train, a superconducting magnet with a tube-type cryostat has been constructed and tested. The shape of the superconducting coil is a rectangle, which has a length of 1.5 m and a width of 0.6 m, and coaxial vessels of the cryostat cover the coil winding. The liquid helium vessel and the outer vacuum vessel of the cryostat have an outside diameter of 8 cm and 14 cm, respectively. The experimental results and the evaluation for the magnet are described."
"Thanks to the zero resistance of a superconducting wire, an induced current in a closed superconducting circuit is continuously exactly opposed to its cause. This phenomenon has been applied to the correction of the field harmonics of a pulsed magnet by putting short-circuited superconducting coils of particular symmetry in the useful aperture of the magnet. After a recall of the choices to be done for the main characteristics of such devices [1], the construction of two correcting coils (quadrupole and sextupole) is described. Experimental results about magnetic efficiency and time behaviour are given; they are quite encouraging since the field harmonicshave been reduced by one or two orders of magnitude."
"Dipoles and quadrupoles have been developed for use in a 12.5 GeV storage ring at the ZGS. The winding bore of these magnets is 10.16 cm with a useful aperture of 7.6 cm. The magnets produce a high quality field (±0.1% nonuniformity including the ends) that requires no correction at any field level. An operating current of 190 A at the design field of 30 kG allows the use of a very low heat leak cryostat design. A 3 meter length of magnets is expected to require only 2 liters helium per hour. Construction of 5 prototype modules, consisting of 2 dipoles and 2 quadrupole each, complete with cryostats, is almost completed."
"A new approach to a ductile composite of Cu and an A-15 superconducting compound has been reported recently. This new metallurgical process consists of melting the constituent elements and subsequent cold-working and heat treatment. The superconducting materials prepared by this technique are composed of about 90 atomic per cent Cu and a superconducting compound such as Nb3Sn or V3Ga which is in the form of fine filaments embedded in the Cu matrix. The new alloy is superconducting at a temperature nearly identical to that of the superconducting phase in bulk form. The current density (Jc) is\\sim10^{4}to 105A/cm2at 4.2°K and zero magnetic field (Jcis calculated by taking the total cross-section of the specimen). An up-to-date account of the experimental situation in this field will be given. The discussion includes (1) the results of varying the alloy composition, the amount of cold-working and the heat treatment; (2) the transition temperature and Jcof Sn-coated Cu-(Nb3Sn) wires; (3) Jcas a function of transverse magnetic field; (4) the phenomenon of Jcenhancement as a result of mechanical deformation and (5) the basic mechanisms responsible for the observed superconductivity in these new materials."
"The Fermilab Energy Doubler project will require some 744 dipoles 6 meters long and 240 quadrupoles of varying lengths from 1.5 meters to 2 meters. Since earliest conception the Energy Doubler has been envisaged as an adjunct accelerator located in the same tunnel as the present Main Ring and capable of reaching a final proton energy of ∼1000 GeV. To do this using a lattice similar to the Main Ring's requires a bending field of 45 kilogauss and, consequently, superconducting magnets.[1] The magnet fabrication and testing program was initiated in September 1972, operated the first test magnets in January 1973, settled on a shell type geometry by June 1973, tested and evaluated a matched set of dipoles by November 1973 and operated the first 6 meter, or \"20 ft\", prototype dipole by March 1974. The 20 ft dipole did not perform satisfactorily, reaching less than 50% of design current and exhibiting excessive training. Consequently, a redirection of the program channeled further efforts into a 2.5 ft model program to identify and correct the sources of difficulty and to enable resumption of 20 ft prototype construction. The first phase of the 2.5 ft program has included the construction and testing of 12 magnets and is essentially complete. It has led to the promise of an improved wire and a slightly more conservative magnet design that is now being used in the construction of 2 1/2 and 10 ft models. Events in an intensive development program do not proceed in logical sequence. While the 2.5 ft model program has been in active progress, two additional 20 ft prototype dipoles of the original design and one 7 ft quadrupole have been completed. One of these, 20 ft dipole #2, has been successfully operated in the forced flow liquid helium pump loop.[2] A 7 ft warm iron quadrupole has also been tested successfully and would be adequate in present form for use in the Doubler project."
"A 342 filament Nb3Sn conductor made by \"the bronze\" approach is described in some detail. Larger conductors containing 1045 and 3553 filaments, respectively, are also mentioned. One of these contains a barrier layer to separate the bronze matrix from high conductivity copper which is required for stability in some applications. A high aspect ratio version of the 3553 filament conductor has also been made. A 67 507 filament conductor carrying 1000 A at 12 T, developed for Lawrence Livermore Laboratories, is shown. It has been made into several different configurations, one with the size and aspect ratio of the 3553 filament conductor shows less anisotropy in current properties with different field orientations."
"The design of a shield winding to be placed around a superconductive magnet is discussed. By operating the shield and main winding in parallel, it is possible to transfer energy to and from the magnet system without exposing the superconductive coil to a changing field, thereby eliminating ac losses in the superconductor and stabilizer. Such units have applications for CTR devices and for load leveling the power demand of the main ring at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory."
"A superconductive magnetic energy storage system has been designed to smooth the pulsating power requirement of the Fermilab accelerator. The system stores 1 MWh and operates at peak power level of 200 MW on a 10 sec cycle. The magnetic system employs cryogenically stable superconductors and a flux-forcing normal secondary. The power system uses phase controlled thyristor rectifier-inverters similar to those employed in the main accelerator power supply."
 "We have previously reported radiant energy detection by superconducting thin films in both a thermal (or bolometer) mode and a current mode. We now report evidence that at least some current-mode detection is due to Josephson behavior associated with agglomeration in tin films. The temperature dependence of the critical current agrees with results for Dayem bridges, and we observe microwave-induced steps in the current-voltage characteristics which have the proper dependence on frequency and power. At a constant film resistance the current-mode responsivity shows structure (dips) in its dependence on bias current which shifts with microwave frequency in agreement with the Josephson theory. The films appear to behave like an array of weak links in the \"correlated\" state as observed by Clark and explained by him and Tilley."
"Magnetic Corporation of America has designed and is presently building a 300 kJ superconducting pulsed energy storage coil. The coil is a solenoid and will operate at a central flux density of 2.0 Wb/m2and a current of 10 kA. The critical current as measured by extrapolation along the peak field load line is 15 kA. The structure which is completely non-conducting has been designed mechanically so that the coil may be operated at 12 KA. The windings are partially potted and are cooled on one face of the braid. It has been designed to remain superconducting throughout the 10 s charge period and the 2 ms discharge period. The repetition period is 30 s."
"We have measured the critical current at 4.2 K in Nb-strips of 1 μm thickness and different width, w, prepared by electron-beam vacuum-deposition. The substrate temperature during the deposition was varied between room temperature and 800°C. The width of the Nb strips ranged between 20 and 300 μm. Whereas up to 600°C the different substrate temperatures yielded about the same average critical current density, Jc, (critical current divided by sample cross section) the specimens prepared with 800°C substrate temperature showed a reduction of Jcby a factor of 4-6. In zero applied magnetic field the samples prepared with 400°C substrate temperature or lower showed a decrease of Jcroughly proportional to w-1/2. Our critical current data obtained in an applied perpendicular field, for the high-field regime, were compared with Kramer's theory of flux pinning which assumes plastic shearing of the flux-line lattice around individual pinning sites during flux flow."
"For wire samples of cold worked Nb- 40wt%Ti and Nb-50wt%Ti a strong anisotropy of the volume pinning force Fpis observed, when the angle between transport current and external magnetic field is varied. Good agreement with the experimental results is found, if Fpdepends on fp2, where fpis the pinning force per pinning centre, and if one takes into account the finite dimensions of the subbands that act as pinning centres. For the current-optimized samples, a smaller anisotropy is seen, and for recrystallized samples the pinning force is practically independent of the orientation of current and field, as it was expected."
"Multipole magnetic fields up to 17,600 Oe were trapped transversely to the axes of solid, hollow, and split hollow superconducting cylinders. Dipole, quadrupole, and sextupole magnetic fields were permanently stored with high fidelity to the original fields using Pb, Nb, and Nb3Sn. The advantages of this technique are mahifold: 1. Only one pattern magnet has to be made, whose field, regardless of configuration, may then be inexpensively replicated ad infinitum. 2. There is a saving of space, weight, and material. 3. There is a saving of electrical power, as the only power loss is due to heat conduction. 4. The stored magnetic field can remain extremely stable over long periods of time. 5. The magnetic field can persist for long durations even during power curtailments or shutdowns. This paper will explore the advantages and limitations of this technique, experimental results, geometry effects, and possible applications."
"In the past several years, considerable progress has been made in developing a low loss superconductor for use in a 60 Hz ac power transmission line. In particular, work by Snowden, et al.[1] has indicated the possibility of exploiting conductor configurations attainable by thin film evaporation techniques to achieve critical currents and ac loss characteristics superior to that of bulk materials. In this paper, we describe instrumentation which has been designed to test conductors fabricated by the evaporation technique and present some of our first results on these materials."
"A superconducting ac power cable has been developed using Nb/Cu/Invar composite conductors and shields in a coaxial configuration with pressurized. He at 4.7 K as the primary dielectric. Two major concerns for this cable system were the accommodation of fault currents and the differential thermal expansion between the conductor assembly and the cryogenic envelope. We have shown that a Nb/Cu/Invar composite tube is capable of accommodating the fault currents as well as the differential thermal expansion. Studies of the effect of surface finish on the ac losses showed that with proper surface finish, the losses can be reduced to an acceptable level for power cable applications. The lowest 60 Hz losses measured at a peak surface magnetic field of 0.1 T correspond to 43 watts per 3-phase mile for a 138 kV, 3400 MVA power cable."
"The preparation and characterization of a multifilament niobium carbonitride yarn is reported here for the first time. The fine diameter multifilament yarn was prepared by chemical conversion of a precursor carbon yarn. The fibers are generally composed of both NbC and NbCN phases and exhibit a Tcof 16-17.5°K and an Hc2of 110- 120kG. Icvalues at zero field of up to 130 amperes have been measured corresponding to a Jcof 106A/cm2. Icis proportional to the amount of superconductor phase present as judged by weight gain data. At low conversion levels an anomaly has been detected in critical current behavior of the fibers suggesting a non-continuous superconducting path. Electrical contact to the fibers by copper coating is discussed showing the importance of obtaining a low resistance contact. Jcwas measured as a function of magnetic field for both the pure material and samples doped with silicon using SiCl4. The silicon dopant was found to be effective in reducing the field dependence of the critical current."
"A new computer code is briefly described which can be advantageously applied to superconducting toroidal systems with complicated coil shapes. The guiding idea is to use the same geometry for the current elements and the stress model. Furthermore, a short review shows that more work is necessary for elucidating the influence of mechanical stress on the critical current density of the superconductors and on the physical properties of the non-superconducting stabilizing material. Values for the centripetal force acting on each torus coil can be easily calculated when the \"1/r approximation\" for the magnetic flux density is assumed. The influence of the magnetic flux leaking out between the coils is discussed and it is shown that for tori with large numbers of coils (say, 32 to 64) and with not too large aspect ratios (say, 1.5 to 2) the above mentioned approximation for the calculation of the centripetal forces yields values which are only a few percent too large. Finally, the consequence of a coil failure in a toroidal magnet is discussed under the assumption that each superconducting coil operates in persistent mode. Due to the re-arrangement of the currents and of the magnet fields, centripetal forces and perpendicular force components result whose asymptotically reached values are appreciably larger than the static values calculated for a torus with one coil missing."
"Current sharing in a two-layer composite is studied analytically by numerically solving the 1-dimensional diffusion equation in the normal metal and the phenomenological critical state model with field independent critical current density Jc(T) in the superconductor, with boundary conditions appropriate to a transmission line at each surface and the interface. It is found that with a sufficiently low resistivity (ρ) backing, and reasonable assumptions as to heat transfer, an appreciable fraction of a current density of several thousand amps per cm can be carried in the backing with the balance in a superconductor with high Tcsuch as Nb3Sn. The dependence of the dissipation on such parameters as thickness, Jc, ρ and frequency at constant temperature is given, and typical loss voltage waveforms presented."
"Observations on very small Pb-Pb oxide-Pb tunnel junctions prepared by a new method are reported. The zero-voltage Josephson critical current is found to increase, then decrease with decreasing temperature. The current-voltage characteristics show very prominent periodic structure. The junctions have microwave (X-band) power sensitivities of 10-14W, more than two orders of magnitude better than conventional-size junctions."
"New metallurgical phases and enhanced superconductivity can be obtained using hot substrate sputtering. Some advantages and limitations of this technique are discussed. For Nb-Ge studies of Tc, resistivity, crystallographic structure, compositional dependences, and impurities are summarized. Although Tcvaries with composition it is not found to be critically dependent upon exact stoichiometry and, at the same composition, is considerably higher in the films than in the bulk. A simple correlation between Tcand resistance ratio is reported."
"There are many large, useful electromagnets in service in Laboratories thru-out the world that are faced with common problems; incipient failure due to age, ever present desire for higher fields and staggering escalation of power costs. Conventional rewind is generally not feasible due to magnet configuration and continuing high operating costs. This paper presents a unique engineering approach for the modification of existing exciting coils to operate in a superconducting mode using proven state of the art techniques and considerable cost savings over the fabrication of new superconducting coil packages using more conventional coil packaging. Typical cost analyses show the attractive use of such proposals."
"A 92-MHz superconducting-Nb helix resonator of exceptional quality has been thoroughly tested under a variety of conditions. The unit is a full-scale λ/2 structure with dimensions appropriate for heavy-ion acceleration. When operated at a temperature of 1.8K and with bare (not anodized) Nb surfaces, the low-field Q is 9.4 × 109, equivalent to a surface resistance of 5 × 10-10ohms. The maximum surface magnetic field is 1200 G and the maximum surface electric field is 37 MV/m, which corresponds to a traveling-wave axial accelerating field of 4.6 MV/m. These characteristics set new performance standards for helix resonators. A systematic study of the effects of various surface treatments, including abuses of the cavity, are described. The tests consist of 24 liquid helium cooldowns, at 4.2K and 1.8K, of the cavity with bare and anodized Nb surfaces which at various times were electropolished, oxypolished and heat treated. RF and helium conditioning are discussed as techniques to get through multipactoring barriers and extend the maximum obtainable electric field."
"Presents the back cover of the periodical issue."
 "Present state of the art in tape wound Nb3Sn solenoids is the generation of magnetic fields above 15T in clear bore diameters up to 65 mm. Details of the construction and operation of magnets of this type, especially the first one which achieved 15.8T in a 26 mm bore at 4.2K are given. The operation of this solenoid at reduced temperatures in a pumped helium bath is described. The solenoid was operated at various temperatures to below 3K where a maximum field of 16.5T was observed, limited only by mechanical strength. The prospect of achieving even higher fields at 4.2K and lower temperatures is discussed in terms of the properties of Nb3Sn and practical design considerations."
"An effective method for the fabrication of multifilamentary Nb3Sn tape has been developed. Filamentary superconductive paths are produced in otherwise standard commercial superconductor tape by the chemical milling of separator slots through the Nb3Sn layer. The present multifilament configuration features a matrix of ten parallel helical superconducting paths along the length of the tape; filament width and interfilament separation are approximately 1.2 mm and 0.4 mm respectively. Thirty-five multifilamentary tapes 0.4 m long were produced. Complete arrays of continuous, fully-defined filaments were reliably formed. Tapes tested as small pancake coils (6-10T) demonstrated the integrity and continuity of the matrix and showed that critical current was sustained in direct proportion to retained superconductor. Interesting behavioral differences resulted from filamentization: critical current anisotropy was reversed, and the slope of the Icversus H curve was reduced. Other tests found qualitative evidence of substantially improved stability in the multifilamentary tape."
"Measurements on two types of S-band single-cell cavities are reported. In these investigations our interest has been directed toward questions concerning the location and mechanisms of magnetic field breakdown in these cavities. The results show that in TM modes the surface electric fields are an important factor in the initiation of rf breakdown. Among the mechanisms for rf breakdown are: localized heating initiated by multipacting electrons, deterioration of the superconducting properties through the impact of electrons, and inherent inhomogeneities in the surface. In order to reduce the electron loading and subsequent field limitation, careful treatments have been applied to the surface. In doing this fields of 81 mT in an electron free mode and 40 mT and 25 MV/m in TM modes were attained in one type of cavity. In the other type cavity 67 mT and 38 MV/m have been attained."
"Microwave critical magnetic flux densities Bcacup to 160 mT and higher than Bc1were obtained with niobium-cavities by special surface treatments. Breakdown in this flux density region occurs by a thermal breakdown mechanism in which no superconducting critical flux density is involved. Considerable increase in Bcacmay be expected with high-Tc-superconductors such as Nb3Sn. Nb3Sn-layers were produced on niobium structures by exposing them to a saturated Sn-vapour at 1000 °C. Bcac-values up to 40 mT and surface resistances smaller than 10-6Ω were measured with TE011-cavities at 9.5 GHz."
"Niobium microbridges developed for SQUID applications are discussed. We can reliably produce superconducting films down to a thickness of 50 Angstroms using rf bias sputtering techniques. Bridge patterns of submicron width are produced through electron lithography with a scanning electron microscope/flying spot scanner combination. The transition from macroscopic leads to the microbridge is made with a multiple exposure technique. The pattern is reproduced in the superconducting niobium films by sputter etching."
"Electrical and thermal conductivities of Cu-4, 10, and 20 at.% Ni are presented from 1-25 K. These alloy concentrations are typical of those being used in some composite superconductors to minimize electrical coupling between filaments during rapidly changing fields. Data are presented for both highly annealed and heavily deformed specimens. For a given alloy, the electrical conductivities increase as a result of deformation and can vary by nearly 10%. The thermal conductivities decrease as a result of deformation and can vary by greater than a factor of two forT \\geq 4K."
"This paper describes a method of manufacturing stabilized multifilament superconductors by connection of single or multifilament wires together by electroplating process. The method was tried first in summer 1965 just after appearing of paper by Kantrowitz and Stekly [1]. The scheme of the method is shown in Fig. 1. A set of parallel wires was wound onto a drum and then immersed into an electrolitic bath. The turns were separated with an insulated wire to prevent their coalescence. Copper covering of both sides of the set resulted in a high quality stable conductor. At that time we considered the method as a successful palliative which allowed us, however, to test our first stable coil in summer 1965 (Fig. 2). But eventually the advantages of the method became evident. Some of them are inherent to all compound conductors, i.e. conductors which consist of a number of smaller cross section conductors or wires joined in parallel. The advantages are as following: 1. The superconducting components can be manufactured by optimum process. They can be tested preliminary and properly selected. It eliminates the risk of spoiling great quantity of expensive superconducting alloy at once. 2. The length of the conductor is not determined by the size of a metallurgical billet. It is possible to make large cross section conductors of any necessary length without using of expensive metallurgical equipment. 3. Superconducting wires can be fully transposed in such a conductor."
"Classical adiabatic stability criteria appear to be pessimistic for multifilamentary composites. The thermal conductivity K, the magnetic and thermal diffusivities Dmand Dθ, the heat transfer coefficient hkplay a leading part in the determination of a stable composite. The differential magnetic and thermal equations have been solved and typical stability curves are given for either the slab model or the round conductor. Measurements of the quenching currents, in different magnetic, thermal and cooling conditions, for two meter long non inductive coils are made. The results are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions."
 "The cryogenic and electrical aspects of a program to evaluate superconductors for a dc superconducting power transmission line are presented. Results for conductors in lengths of 20 meters operated at currents up to 10 kA are described. A battery driven power supply which is capable of delivering and controlling currents upto 50 kA is discussed. Specific experiments are discussed which have been designed to probe the response of the conductors to a variety of thermal and electrical conditions, such as: thermal gradients over the length of the conductor, single and two phase flow of cryogen, loss of coolant flow, operation at temperatures near Tc, a.c. ripple current, and high current ramping rates."
"Self field critical current densities of thick Nb3Ge films have been measured in the liquid hydrogen temperature range 13.8 - 21 K. Bulk critical current densities Jcabove 1.6 × 106A/cm2were observed at 14 K falling linearly at higher temperatures. The behavior extrapolated to zero critical current gave a critical temperature Tc∼ 19.2 K which is ∼1.5 K lower than the onset Tcdetermined from the a.c. magnetic susceptibility. The samples were long sections of copper tubes, which had been coated on the inside with Nb3Ge by a chemical vapor deposition process. Jcfor various high Tcmaterials are compared including calculations of adiabatic stability. Nb3Ge holds promise for a dc superconducting power transmission line operating near 14 K."
"By using a Mo0.75Re0.25alloy endplate on a Nb microwave cavity (TE011mode, resonant at 11.2 GHZ), an upper bound for the residual surface resistance of this alloy was shown to be 2.8 µ-ohm, a lower bound for the breakdown field was shown to be 102 G. In view of the fact that these properties were determined at 11.2 GHZ on the first Mo-Re endplate made with no particular effort devoted to optimization of surface quality, this material is deserving of further consideration for practical microwave applications."
"The surface metallurgy of niobium will be discussed including factors such as impurity distributions at the surface and surface topography. Measurements of the penetration depth are presented both in the clean limit, where there is about a 20Å region of oxygen at the surface, after high temperature heat treatment, which affects the boundary condition on the GL order parameter; and in the dirty limit where heating in an oxygen atmosphere near 10-6torr can greatly affect the surface roughness. Auger measurements of the surface conditions in a 1% Zr in Nb alloy are also presented. A discussion is given of preliminary results in a special apparatus where rf breakdown experiments can be performed on small samples and correlated with the metallurgical factors mentioned above."
"Superconducting magnet technology is one phase of applied superconductivity where significant electrical power savings may be appreciated. Furthermore, these power savings maybe gained without sacrificing reliability of operation or initial capital costs. This paper describes the design and construction of 4 large superconducting dipole magnets which are being used at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory to conduct high energy physics experiments. Two of these magnets have been built and operated continuously for several months prior to installation in beam lines. Two larger superconducting dipoles are presently under construction and both magnets will be completed this year. All magnets are designed to operate continuously without special attention consuming approximately 10% of the power which would be demanded by a conventional magnet. The engineering concept and construction techniques are described."
"The need for low cost, low thermal conductivity, high strength insulation suitable for cryogenic applications is becoming more evident. An investigation of the potential of cellular concretes to fulfill this function has been initiated. A review of the thermal and mechanical characteristics of foamed plastics and cellular concrete is presented along with relative cost comparisons. Test data from preliminary investigations is presented to define the influence of material constituents, density and temperature on the mechanical and thermal response of cellular concrete. Specimen densities range from 0.64 to 1.44 gr/cc. The influence of temperature variations from 22°C to -196°C is reported for selected densities."
"This paper describes a series of experiments on small straight-sided ('racetrack') magnets designed to investigate the influence of the force support structure on training. In windings typical of those used in large magnets we have demonstrated that training can be eliminated by correct clamping of the windings and that it can be re-introduced by poor clamping. This behaviour has been found for several quite different types of winding impregnation and has also been confirmed at temperatures down to 2.3 K."
"A design of a read out system for a superconducting gyroscope to be used in an orbiting Gyroscope Relativity Experiment is discussed. The \"London Moment\" of the superconducting rotor, which lies along the spin axis of the rotor, will be measured with a SQUID type magnetometer. The SQUID will be built around the gyro rotor, with a very close spacing to give an inductance between 10-8and 10-9Hy. A SQUID of this design should resolve 10-4φo. The angular resolution of the gyroscope will then be\\Delta\\theta = 3.5 \\times 10^{-3}arc-second, which is sufficient for the intended experiment."
"An outline of the magnetic levitation project in Japan is given. Research has been concentrated on levitation system utilizing electromagnetic repulsive force between a normal metal track and on-board superconducting magnets. Development of levitation magnets together with other items basic for a levitation system is given."
"We report the development of a simple 450MHz SQUID magnetometer, utilizing a symmetric two-hole permanently adjusted point contact SQUID ring. One hole of the SQUID ring is coupled to the center conductor of a resonant superconducting coaxial cavity. A superconducting coil, inserted into the other hole, allows us to couple an external flux into the SQUID system. The sensitivity is an order of magnitude better than that attained with identical SQUID rings biased at ∼10MHz. We show that this improvement can be achieved simply and relatively inexpensively, and without sacrificing the excellent flux coupling attainable with such SQUID rings."
"This paper discusses the current status of superconducting, d.c. motors and generators with particular regard to civil marine propulsion. It commences with a brief account of the factors which help to ensure reliability and proceeds to enumerate the advantages which are expected from superconducting d.c. marine propulsion systems. Following a mention of a practical demonstration of the latter, now under test at IRD, the paper concludes with assessment of the general market for the machines. Also, included in the paper is some mention of industrial applications for these new machines."
"The results of experimental investigation of \"non-Josephson\" radiation from the X-band cavity containing the Nb-Nb superconducting point contact junction are discussed. Experimental dependences of the amplitude and frequency of \"non-Josephson\" oscillations on the bias voltage across the junction and modifying of the I-V-characteristic (IVC) of the junction under action of these oscillations are presented. The comparison of the results with theoretical calculations is made. It is shown that the influence of fluctuations on phenomenon characteristics is considerable."
 "The amplitudes of the signal lobes (\"Bessel Maxima\") observed in several types of thin film SQUIDs excited at 9.2 GHz exhibit pronounced periodic intensity modulation. This behavior is consistent with the simplified flux entry model proposed by Mercereau in the limit of\\tau \\sim Twhere T is the shortest time between successive flux entry into loop and τ is the flux passage time. From our results, τ was deduced to be\\sim 10^{12}seconds for both proximity effect and narrow constriction devices."
"Using a superconducting ring containing a Nb point contact inductively coupled to a resonant circuit fed with an rf current source, (typical rf SQUID configuration) we have measured the tank voltage as a function of frequency in the regimeLI_{c}< \\Phi_{0}/2\\pi. ForLI_{c} \\ll \\Phi_{0}/2\\pi, the curves of tank voltage versus drive current for various values of external flux\\Phi_{x}through the ring agree with the calculations of Hansma. For higher critical currents, there is an asymmetry in these curves for frequencies above and below ω0, the resonant frequency of the circuit. Calculations using an expanded theory including the effects of a conductanceG_{o}(1+\\alpha \\cos \\phi)and of screening flux give good agreement with the data. In principle α can be determined from these measurements, however the\\cos \\phiterm and the screening flux produce qualitatively similar effects. A quantitative determination of α requires a precise knowledge of Go/Ic. Using values of Goand Icfrom independent impedance measurements, the data yield a negative value of α in agreement with another experiment."
  "A review is given of energy legislation activities of the 93rd Congress, particularly since the Arab oil embargo, with attention mainly to energy provision technologies R&D - program goals and management organization. Relations are pointed out between Congressional actions on the one hand and Congressional committee jurisdication and personalities on the other. The relevance of this legislation for a particular technology, superconductive electrical transmission, is pointed out."
   "Measurements of the upper critical fields are presented for ternary metal-molybdenum-sulfides as a function of temperature, T, with dc magnetic fields up to ∼215kG and pulsed fields to ∼500kG. A nearly linear variation of HC2versus T is observed up to the highest dc fields for all the compounds. The materials (nominal composition), Tc(measured);(dH_{C2}/dT)_{T=T_{c}}(measured), and HC2(4.2 K) (calculated) for a dirty type II superconductor assuming no paramagnetic limiting are respectively: (a) Pb0.9Mo5.1S6: 11.7 K, 60 kG/K, 390 kG; (b) SnAl0.5Mo4.5S6: 14.2 K, 32 kG/K; 275 kG; (c) SnMo5S6:13.4K, 37kG/K; 290 kG; (d) PbMo5.1S6: 14.4, 60kG/K, 515kG. Pulsed field measurements yield HC2(4.2 K) = 390 kG for (a), 275 kG for (b), 290 kG for (c), and ≃510kG for (d). The PbMo5.1S6has the highest value of HC2measured to date."
"It has been demonstrated that the superconducting compound Nb3Sn can be produced at the interface of Nb and a Cu-Sn alloy when the composite is heat treated at the proper reaction temperature. This method of Nb3Sn preparation was also shown to be particularly suited to the fabrication of (a) Nb3Sn multifilamentary composite wires for dc and low frequency applications and (b) low ac loss Nb3Sn tapes for 60 Hz applications. The fabrication method and superconducting properties of Nb3Sn composite conductors made by this process are reviewed and the metallurgical aspects of the process are discussed. Since practical applications of these composites requires large, high current conductors, methods of producing compound conductors such as cables and braided ribbons which include strengthening and stabilizing components are also discussed and some preliminary results of high current conductors are presented."
"We describe point contact junctions with normal state resistances of 10Ω - 10kΩ, made from electropolished Nb parts, which couple well to millimeter radiation. The response is governed by fluctuations. The principal effect of external radiation is a change in the dynamic resistance. An approximate expression is given for the differential resistance at zero current, based on a linear combination of the effect of fluctuations and of microwave radiation. Experimental data show significant deviations from the RSJ model. The results are in qualitative agreement with numerical calculations by Kalashnik et al. We argue that in our junctions zero-point fluctuations are dominant, caused by the very small capacitance of about 10-15F."
"As the cost of fossil fuel has increased and the load factors on electric utilities have decreased, the need for efficient, reliable energy storage systems has increased. Although pumped hydro storage is now used extensively on those utility systems having the appropriate resources nearby, it is only 65% efficient. Superconducting magnetic energy storage which promises to be more than 90% efficient and easily sited may become a competitive energy storage technology. A comparison of the various energy storage systems is presented in terms of performance on electric power systems, and cost. Emphasis is given to the various technologies involved in the development of large superconducting magnets. A brief review of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory program on superconducting magnetic energy storage is included."

 "The authors give the chemical, morphological, crystallographic, and magnetic properties of solid solutions between cubic iron sesquioxide γFe2O3and cobalt ferrite CoFe2O4obtained as fine particles by a new preparation method. This method gives the whole range of compositions and allows shifting of the magnetic and morphological features in a direction suitable for magnetic recording applications."
"The variations in coercivity, remanence, and microstructure for2\\frac{1}{2}hour aging anneals between 300°C and 1000°C on an Fe/Co/3% V alloy have been determined. Additionally, the effects of varying aging times for temperatures between 885°C and 925°C have been analyzed. Hysteresis parameters and optical microstructures were characterized on wire samples which had been either cold worked by stamping or remained undeformed prior to the aging anneals. Results show that the alloy exhibits maximum magnetic hardness in its initial cold worked or undeformed conditions. Aging anneals produce a general decrease in magnetic properties with increasing temperatures to 700°C. However, the deformed material exhibits a secondary maximum for aging temperatures between 590°C and 610°C. For anneals above 800°C magnetic parameters again increase as a two-phased, duplex BCC (α1+ α2) structure is developed. By varying the aging time for anneals that produce this duplex structure, a level of coercivity comparable to that achieved for a 600°C anneal was attainable. However, a comparable level of remanence and, thus, a similar squareness ratio, could not be produced with the duplex structures developed by aging near 900°C."
"The solution of the integral magnetic field equation by numerical iteration is discussed. Using a simple linear example, it is shown rigorously that relaxation techniques are required to obtain convergence. The range of permissible relaxation parameters is examined and that particular value which yields most rapid convergence is determined. An iterative solution to a simple nonlinear problem is shown to converge rapidly if the relaxation parameter is adjusted appropriately at each step in the iteration. For the general case of a saturable media of complex geometric shape, a relaxation matrix method is proposed in order to achieve rapid convergence."
"In recent years a better understanding of the magnetic recording process has resulted from self-consistent iterative calculations of the magnetization transition induced in the recording medium. One important limitation on these calculations has been the difficulty in fitting realistic hysteresis loops into these calculations. It is not practical to include the actual hysteresis loops, so the practice has been to approximate them by various plausible models. However, none of these models fit the actual loops as closely as would be desired. In this paper, we avoid modelling the major loops, but approximate them using spline interpolation. We demonstrate, by comparison with experimental loops, that the actual loops can be approximated much more closely than with an analytic model. A criterion for deriving the minor loops is given, and we demonstrate a generally better fit of the initial minor loops than that obtained from a model. A self-consistent iterative calculation is made using both an analytic model and the spline approximated loops. We find that the choice of loop model noticeably affects the calculated magnetization distribution and that the spline approximated loops lead to a transition width which more closely matches the width estimated from an experimental single readback pulse. In summary, we demonstrate that good simulation of the hysteresis loops can be significant and discuss a simple approximation technique from which an excellent fit to actual loops can be obtained."
"Defects causing extra-bit errors on a magnetic storage disk can be represented by a simple model. An experiment supporting the validity of the model is described."
"A general equation for the axial magnetic field at any point due to a cylindrical pole-piece with a spherical pole tip magnetized uniformly to saturation is derived in terms of the various distances and linear dimensions. In conclusion, brief remarks are made on the general usefulness of the equations."
"The problem of lens convergence because of very high voltages used in electron microscopy can be mastered with superconducting lenses, the magnetic circuit of which is partly saturated. The equations of magnetostatics have to be solved directly for the investigation of the properties of such lenses. A network method is used and it is shown how to establish finite-difference equations for the solution of equations referring to saturated magnetic materials. A computing program for symmetrical lenses is described, and the accuracy of the solution is estimated by comparison of the computational results with those measured on an actual lens."
"An annotated literature survey covering major development in the area of microwave ferrite materials and devices for the period 1968-1974 is presented."
"The design and operation of a magnetic bubble AND-OR gate are reported. Operation at 100 kHz in a 25 Oe rotating field with 28.2 μm circuit periodicity was achieved with about 50 percent of the free bubble bias field margins. A transfer pulse is used to divert bubbles from a propagation path which delivers the AND output tO one which delivers the OR output. The transfer is defeated by the presence of a bubble in the appropriate cycle of the OR path. The AND bubble is then delayed by one cycle instead of being transferred. This frastrated transfer strategy was devised to circumvent the restrictive bias field limitations in the operation of previous logic circuits."
 "The vector helium magnetometer, one of the Pioneer-Jupiter experiments, has measured the magnetic field of Jupiter and the interplanetary magnetic field in the outer solar system. The comprehensive scientific objectives of the investigations are explained and are then translated into the major instrument requirements. The principles of operation of the magnetometer, which involve the optical pumping of metastable helium, are discussed and the Pioneer instrument is described. The in-flight performance of the magnetometer is discussed and principal scientific results obtained thus far by the Pioneer investigation are summarized."
"Thermomagnetic recording is the production of a remanent magnetization in a material by cooling it from a critical temperature in a small magnetic field. The most prominent applications for thermomagnetic recording presently under consideration are high density information storage and tape copying; other applications, e.g., display and magnetic printing, can also be envisioned. In this review of the field, we discuss the proposed applications of thermomagnetic recording, the physical principles of the various magnetic phenomena that can be used for this purpose, and the degree to which specific materials meet the requirements for thermomagnetic recording."
"A status report on progress toward the development of a magnetic levitation and propulsion system for mass transportation is presented. It summarizes important results and provides a bibliography for further study. Emphasis is placed on various aspects of different magnetic structures which have been proposed for this application."
"The anisotropic magnetoresistance effect in 3d transition metals and alloys is reviewed. This effect, found in ferromagnets, depends on the orientation of the magnetization with respect to the electric current direction in the material. At room temperature, the anisotropic resistance in alloys of Ni-Fe and Ni-Co can be greater than 5%. The theoretical basis takes into account spin orbit coupling and d band splitting. Other properties such as permeability, magnetostriction, and Hall voltage have no simple relationship to magnetoresistance. Anisotropic magnetoresistance has an important use as a magnetic field detector for digital recording and magnetic bubbles. Such detectors because of their small size are fabricated using thin film technology. Film studies show that thickness, grain size, and deposition parameters play a significant role in determining the percentage change in magnetoresistance. In general, the change is smaller in films than bulk materials. Several tables and graphs that list bulk and film data are presented."

"A general theory is developed that applies to arbitrary polarization and takes account of damping and of the dipolar interaction between domains. The effect of the microwave field on the domain structure can be characterized by a pressure on the domain walls and by an alignment energy, both of which are proportional to the square of the rf magnetic field and become large in the vicinity of a resonance. For circular polarization the pressure tends to decrease the Larmor-domains (domains in which the imposed sense of polarization coincides with the sense of the natural spin precession) for frequencies outside the resonance region. Inside the resonance region, however, the pressure tends to increase the Larmor-domains. A linearly polarized field also exerts a pressure on the domain walls, with the polarity dependent upon the orientation of the field to the wall normal. In a linearly polarized magnetic field the domain walls tend to become aligned parallel to the rf field at frequencies ω near the low-frequency resonance (ω =γHa, γ = gyromagnetic ratio, Ha= anisotropy field) and perpendicular to the rf field at frequencies near the high-frequency resonance (ω = γ[Ha(Ha+ 4πM0)]1/2, M0= saturation magnetization)."
"This paper is a review of ferromagnetic metal film magnetoresistors for applications such as read transducers in advanced computer memory and storage technology (mainly bubble domain memories and magnetic recording systems). Uses of semiconductor Hall effect sensors in this environment are also reviewed, and wherever possible a comparison of the suitability of the two classes of sensors for a particular application is made. The paper includes a phenomenological treatment of galvanomagnetic effects, a brief discussion of materials, design considerations and applications, and a short section on device fabrication techniques."
"The use of magnetic devices in medically-related applications has often been frustrated by insufficient magnetic force, or by an inappropriately designed device. This paper describes magnetic treatment systems which were designed with the benefit of the cooperation of hospital personnel at all levels. Two systems are described in detail. First, a superconducting magnet, with integral orientation system, intended for use in intravascular catheter guidance. The maximum field and gradient produced by this solenoid are 20,000 Oe, and 2250 Oe/cm, respectively. The system is both powerful, and easy to use, by virtue of its completely portable design. The second is a magnetic traction device which has been successfully employed in the treatment of esophageal atresia."
"The inverse magnetostrictive sensitivity of martensitic stainless steel AISI-410 has been examined with intended application for pressure transducers in nuclear environments. The experiments were performed by applying tensile and compressive stresses to a specimen made of AISI-410, and then measuring the voltages induced in the secondary coil of the specimen for various excitation currents of 400 Hz supplied to the primary coil. It has been observed that the sensitivity increases as the excitation strength increases, and that it saturates at about 28 ×10-3Wb/m2/kg. mm-2at an excitation of about 600 AT/m-400 Hz. It seems that the sensitivity and the linear stress range are sufficient for the intended applications. Based on the measured data, a prototype of a miniature pressure transducer has been designed and constructed. The constructed transducer has performed well during tests."
"Butt-ended follower drives have been constructed in which each member consists of a mild steel disc on which a number of equally spaced rectangular or trapezium shaped blocks of permanent magnet alloy are arranged. A drive consists of two such similar assemblies, each magnetized with alternate N and S poles. Variations in the alloy and geometry have been made. The maximum torque that can be developed has been measured with a strain gauge transducer. The torques are greater than those that can be produced within the same diameter by ferrite magnets. A theory derived by Wullkopf for ferrite drives is reasonably accurate for high coercivity alloy assemblies. The influence of attempting to drive through a metallic partition is excess load on the motor rather than loss of transmitted torque. However, high resistivity partitions of austenitic stainless steel or Nimonic alloys are satisfactory."
"The magnetic properties of grain oriented Si-Fe sheet with Goss texture depend on the texture perfection. The texture produced by primary recrystallization is one of the parameters which controls the perfection of the secondary texture. It is here shown that a martensitic phase dispersed in the matrix, obtained by quenching the hot rolled band from high temperature, can affect the primary recrystallization texture. By a particular X ray diffraction method the central part of the {110} pole figure of the primarily recrystallized sample is described. It is clearly shown that if a low temperature transformation phase is present in the microstructure before cold rolling, the divergence of orientation of the individual grains from the ideal one in the final sheet is lower and the 10 Oe permeability is higher."
"We have measured the magnetomechanical coupling in highly magnetostrictive TbxDy1-xFe2-δas a function of bias field, x, and δ. We find a peak coupling factor of 0.6 at x = .26 and bias field of 180 Oe; the largest reported for a magnetostrictive material. The corresponding material Q is 200. Because of the high magnetostriction, relative permeabilities are necessarily low;\\mu_{\\max} \\simeq 5. Young's modulus at constant field changes from 4.5 to ll (x1010n/m2) as the bias changes from zero to 4.5 kOe, corresponding to a change in sound velocity >50%. The magnetomechanical coupling factor was also evaluated for0 \\leq \\delta \\leq .3. When δ is non-zero a eutectic second phase is present which acts as a toughening agent."
"The stability over very long ageing times of iron particles in mercury and the effect of coatings on this stability has been investigated. To study this, ferromagnetic liquids containing 2% by weight of iron in mercury have been prepared by electrodeposition of iron onto an agitated mercury cathode and a mercury/tin amalgam cathode. Measurements of coercivity at 77°K and at room temperature have been made on these samples and show that particle radii in the range 20Å-40Å exist in the tin-free fluid, and between 15Å-30Å in the ferrofluid containing tin. Electron microprobe analysis has shown that a tin coating is present on the iron particles after tin addition. Ageing at 425°K and plotting log(radius)/ log(time) reveals two distinct growth characteristics in both coated and uncoated samples. Previous results obtained by Luborsky can also show these two regions. Electron micrographs of coated samples after ageing show the presence of clustering and particle growth within the clusters. The short term characteristics of the log/log plot can be understood in terms of cluster formation during this period. At the longer ageing times, diffusional growth is thought to be the dominant process."
"Elastic modulus, saturation magnetisation, and Curie temperature measurements have been made on Nispan C and binary 42% Ni alleys after varying degrees of deformation between 0 and 55%. Deformation preduces an increase in modulus (7%) and a substantial reductien in saturatien magnetisation (12%), but only a relatively small change in Tc(2%). The ΔE effect is reduced by deformation, in marked contrast to the effect preduced by ageing. Since Nispan C behaves almost identically to the binary alley, these changes cannot be attributed to deformation-induced precipitation of intermetallic compounds. A modified two gamma states medel is found to explain the observations in a reasonably quantitative manner."
 "The magnetic order development in polycrystalline Ni3Mn alloys has been studied as a function of atomic ordering during anneal at 500°C for times up to 32 hours after an initial quench from 1000°C. The cluster moments appear to saturate at about 5 × 10-17emu, with an exponential growth characterized by a time constant of about 5-10 hours. The clusters grow to about 40 Å radius, assuming an aligned moment of 1 μBper atom within clusters. The cluster density increases abruptly to 2.0 × 1019cm-3after the initial 5-minute anneal, levels off, and then decays to about 1.0 × 1019cm-3. These data suggest that the clusters \"pop in\" during the initial stages of short range order development, and then grow in size to saturation."
"The coercivity, the saturation induction and the initial permeability are investigated as a function of the sputter pressure, the cathode voltage and the thickness of the individual Ni-Fe alloy- and SiO2-layers."
"RCo5Compounds are metastable at room temperature and contain disordered cobalt atom pairs. A pair of atoms creates a zone in which the anisotropy is weak. However, the size of such a zone is not large enough to allow nucleation of reverse domains. The presence of substitution clusters associated with the metastability of the RCo5phase has to be considered. The coercivity essentially depends on the dimension and the anisotropy of these clusters which are mainly related to the amount of substitutions necessary to Stabilize the phase."
"A pulsed-field (1 μ sec to 3 m sec) inductive magnetometer has been constructed that measures the magnetic moment of a ferrofluid as a function of time. After the applied field is removed, the magnetization is characterized by a fast decay (< 1 μ sec) and a gradual decay that can be as long as 4 msec. The fast component of magnetization varies from about 50% to nearly 100% of the total and we conclude it is due to magnetization processes within the particle. The slow component of magnetization is believed to be due to particle rotation and can be related to particle size through a model developed by Janak."
"The experimental performance of high gradient magnetic separators employing an assembly of ferromagnetic fibers as the collecting agent has been reported by several workers and theoretical treatments for this system have been given. In this paper, we report experimental results for the collection of MnO2and αFe2O3on a single nickel wire in an isolated configuration. The deposit developing on the wire is recorded photographically and by electrical measurement. The deposit develops rapidly on a clean wire and then approaches an asymptotic limit which is many particles thick and depends on the properties of the particles and the flow. The experimental results are given, the procedure is described, and some of the problems are discussed."
"The ability of superconducting coils to produce large magnetic fields over large volumes without excessive expenditure of power makes them ideal candidates for use in magnetic separation. This paper is concerned with the effect of high magnetic fields on the separation process in a high intensity type of separator as well as some of the expected characteristics of devices using superconducting coils. It also describes a 50 kilogauss unit having a bore of 5 inches and a matrix length of 20 inches."
"Magnetic separation in water purification uses a magnetically susceptible seeding material as a substrate for pollutant removal. The chemical bond between the seed and pollutant is normally achieved by the action of a chemical coagulant. There are cases, however, in which an additive is not necessary, as in the removal of algal cells from sea water. Under the proper chemical conditions, a coagulant cation such as Fe(III) or Al(III) will yield an insoluble precipitate that will form rapidly throughout the solution. This insoluble species coats the solids of the system and is responsible for the bonding that occurs among the particulates. Since the magnetically susceptible seed material is now part of the coagulum that is formed, the subsequent magnetic separation procedure will remove all of the suspended matter as well as the adsorbed precipitate. This removal is rapid and efficient in the magnetic filtration device. The capability of the magnetic separation process to remove the insoluble precipitates and coagulated solids from solution is examined in detail."
"Diffusion couples formed between cobalt and cerium provide useful information about the eutectoid transformation involving Co5Ce. The presence of Co5Ce in the couple formed at 700°C and its absence in the couple formed at 650°C provides supporting evidence for the instability of Co5Ce. A transformation of an unknown nature was observed in the Co17Ce2phase held for a long period at 650°C."
"High gradient magnetic separation used in the kaolin industry to separate fine, weakly magnetic particles is applicable to the treatment of a variety of waste and process waters in steel mills. High efficiency and low space requirements make high gradient magnetic filtration capable of removing almost all suspended solids found in these waters. High gradient magnetic filtration devices operate much like automatic backflushing filters. The recovery of magnetic particles in these devices depends on the ratio of magnetic to hydrodynamic drag forces which is large for typical particles found in these waters. The cost and performance of high gradient magnetic filters depend on the magnetic field strength and the flow velocity used. Reduction in suspended solids contents of treated waste waters is typically greater than 90% and often exceeds 99%. A full scale treatment plant for basic oxygen furnace waters has been designed and would require a tenth of the land area of that used in a conventional treatment system."
"This paper describes the reduction of the concentration of iron and potassium from a slurry of English Clay using a high intensity superconducting magnetic separator. It was found that for magnetic fields greater than about 2T, the performance of the filter depended on HoVowhere Hois the applied field and Vois the entrance velocity to the filter in agreement with theory. For fields less than 2T there is a slightly enhanced performance which is again in agreement with theory. Although in this region the theory may not be valid because particle size and shape effects become important."
"A new core-transistor multivibrator for firing a thyristor inverter is presented. In the multivibrator introduced here, we conserve size, weight, and power by use of a pulse modulated supply instead of a continuous dc supply. The frequency can be controlled over a wide range by changing the volt time integral of the pulse train. A phase locking technique is developed to prevent fluctuating frequency errors which might otherwise occur in the output."
"To facilitate an efficient comparison of properties of various E.M. bearings, we propose a common analysis framework for either type of bearing which can be characterized by the following properties : the method of partition leads to a unique model ; the basic equations are derived from the electrodynamic theory of continuous media ; a technological classification of bearings is obtained through certain dimensionless matrices and bounds are found for optimal working conditions. After a brief description of the main points of our analysis, we present its application to a cylindrical bearing with liquid metal lubricant ; this bearing seems particularly well suited for the large turbine generators."
"This paper considers the capture of paramagnetic particles, of radius R and susceptibility χ from a slurry, of viscosity η, by a ferromagnetic wire, of radius a and saturation magnetization Ms, in a uniform magnetic field Ho, large enough to saturate the wire, applied perpendicular to the axis of the wire. When the slurry is far away from the wire it's velocity is Vo. Capture is considered for various orientations of Vowith respect to Ho. In the calculations the fluid is treated in the inviscid, incompressible approximation. Calculation shows that when Ms/2μoHois large, the capture radius Rcincreases with Ms/2μoHo. For values of Ms/2μoHo<.2, Rc depends only on Vm/Vo, where Vm, is the magnetic velocity, Vm= (2χMsHoR2/9ηa). The increased performance observed in magnetic filters when μoHo<2T, but operating at constant Vm/Vo, is consistent with the increase of Rcwith Ms/2μoHo. Effects observed in filters when various configurations of flow in relation to field are used could not be explained in terms of the differences in the bare wire values of Rc. It is argued that these differences are due to different dependences of Rcon the volume of material captured in the various configurations."
"A qualitative theory is proposed for the salient-pole hysteresis coupling based on test results from an enlarged model. The relative contributions of alternating and rotating hysteresis losses to the total loss at different excitations are discussed. This leads to an explanation for the shape of the torque/excitation curve which accounts for the fall-off in the torque observed at high values of excitation."
"Two flow-through model ore separators have been constructed and tested. Both separators use the magnetic field of a straight wire conductor which deflects magnetic particles in toward the conductor. Nonmagnetic gangue particles in the water slurry are deflected away by gravity in one case and by centrifugal forces in the other case. Tests have been conducted with synthetic ore slurries made up of carefully screened sizes of magnetite and silica. These tests show that separation does take place and that the theoretical separation time expected for ferromagnetic particles in a magnetic field is obtained."
"Enzymes are immobilised to a wide range of support materials so that their catalytic activity can be re-used in biological reactors. Magnetic support particles have the potential for extending immobilised enzyme technology to new areas of industrial use. The enzyme α-chymotrypsin has been immobilised to several particulate magnetic materials. Uncoated metal and metal oxide powders are unstable in acidic solutions. Even in neutral solutions metal ions from an uncoated particle surface inhibited α-chymotrypsin giving a rapid decline in activity. The rate of loss of activity was greatly reduced by coating the magnetic particles with a thin layer of bovine serum albumin before immobilising the enzyme to them. Reactor designs are proposed using magnetic coolant filters or high gradient magnetic separators to remove the magnetic immobilised enzyme particles from the product stream so that they can be returned to the reactor."
"A method of measuring the refractive index and thickness of garnet films by the combined use of the variable wavelength method and the variable angle monochromatic fringe observation method has been developed. This technique can be used to determine film thicknesses from 0.5 μm to several microns with an accuracy of 1%. A rapid and accurate evaluation technique for the measurement of the bubble collapse field is described. Stable submicron bubbles can be found in the Systems, (YCaSm)3- (GeFe)5O12, (YCaEuTm)3(GeFe)5O12and (YLaTm)3(GaFe)5O12. Bubble velocities for these films were measured by the bubble transport method. At a driving field of 2.5 Oe across the bubble, velocities ranging from 300 te 1050 Cm/sec have been observed."
"Acicular magnetic particles up to about 25 nm thick can be suspended permanently and individually in a liquid. Their orientation by dc and ac magnetic fields can be followed through the induced optical birefringence (Cotton-Mouton effect). Analysis of the field dependencies yields the average magnetic dipole moment of the particles and the width of the distribution, the magnetic anisotropy field, and the distribution of switching fields."
"A high sensitivity flux-gate magnetometer sensor element has been developed by electrodepositing permalloy films on cylindrical conductor substrates with magnetic easy-axis in the axial direction. The cylindrical films are of 2½\" length, ¼\" diameter and vary in thickness from 2 to 12 tousand angstroms. Film composition is 81% Ni and 19% Fe adjusted to zero magnetostriction. The resulting films exhibit an anisotropy field, Hk, of 1 Oersted and less than 5 degrees for the dispersion angie α90."
"The technique of magnetic tagging using materials with different Curie temperatures was initially applied to the identification of oil spills. Continued development has demonstrated the feasibility of magnetic tagging of a very wide range of solids and liquids. This versatile technique offers the benefits of economy, sensitivity, stability, large vocabulary, easy recovery, and no environmental hazards. In addition, the detection system is simple, inexpensive and portable."
"A new type of nonlinear dependence of wall displacement on applied pulse width is studied by the interrupted pulse method in Permalloy films. The phenomenon is attributable to the acceleration and deacceleration of the wall under the applied pulse field and coercive force. The wall relaxation time and wall mass are determined as a function of film thickness. The relaxation time in films thicker than about 700 Å is about 50 ns, which is about thirty times larger than that expected for bulk Permalloy, and decreases rapidly with decreasing film thickness. The measured wall mass is also two to three orders larger than that expected for bulk material. It is found that qualitative agreement is fair between the measured mass and the Schlömann's recent calculation."
"The response of an isolated magnetic bubble domain to pulsed magnetic fields normal to the film plane is measured with high spatial and temporal resolution. Digital signal averaging techniques are used on a succession of identical pulses, permitting changes in bubble radius to be measured to a precision of 2 nanometres, in successive time intervals of 10 nanoseconds. The radial wall velocity, obtained by differentiation, is determined with a precision of 0.2 metres per second. Significant \"inertial\" effects and velocity non-linearities are seen at quite modest drive fields (a few tenths of kA/m, or, a few Oe) and wall velocities (a few m/s), in response both to an applied blas-field step and to a pulse."
"The continuous \"Carousel\" high gradient separator has been used in a pilot scale field test at the Hanna Research Laboratory in Nashwauk, Minnesota. Also, a new batch type magnetic separator acquired by Hanna was used to extend the range of some of the parameters affecting the separation of the oxidized taconite iron ores selected for this program. Three ore blends were used, one of which was similar to the sample on which tests were performed at MIT in a previous test program. The object of the field test was to produce a feed for the flotation pilot plant in which a successful flotation of a difficult-to-treat ore blend had been achieved. High iron recovery from the crude feed was sought as well as the rejection of a large part of the feed weight with a small iron content. Achievement of this goal would result in a considerable saving in reagent costs for the flotation process. The results of tests on the longer matrix used in the batch tests were very high recoveries. They were correlated closely with the results of continuous tests which were confined to short matrix lengths. A short discussion of flotation is included."
"It is known that copper-hardened magnets can be prepared from alloys lying between the 1:5 and 2:17 phases. We show that good magnetic properties are only obtained within a limited region of the phase space, in material which has been equilibrated at temperatures of the order 1200°C and then given a second treatment at about 800°C. Such materials contain two phases which form at the higher temperature and which are metastable at low temperatures. Decomposition of the phases adversely affects the magnetic properties. Small additions of iron enhance both remanence and coercivity provided no FeCo precipitation occurs; the microstructural requirements are otherwise identical to iron-free materials."
"Axial currents in the form of step functions or pulses flowing in a filament parallel to and inside a cylindrical shell of infinite length and finite thickness, give rise to eddy currents in the conducting material of the shell due to proximity effect. Similar currents returning through the shell give rise to skin effect. The distribution of both these types of currents is determined analytically by solving the differential equation for penetration of currents in the conducting material in the transient state and appropriately applying boundary conditions. The associated loss is also determined. Constant permeability is assumed."
"High gradient magnetic separation is a new technique which provides a practical means for separating weakly paramagnetic materials down to colloidal particle size on a large scale and at flow rates over one hundred times faster than the flow rates possible in ordinary filtration. The technique is also applicable to non-magnetic materials which can be made to associate with magnetic seed materials. HGMS has already been applied industrially to the purification of kaolin for paper coating, and is also applicable to the beneficiation of many minerals which are too finely divided to be economically separable by any existing method. Other potential applications include the desulfurization and de-ashing of pulverized and liquefied coal, the decontamination of water, industrial waste and municipal sewage, and even the decontamination of rivers and lakes. HGMS is based on the use of matrices of finely divided filamentary ferromagnetic material containing 95% void space, such as felted or woven steel fabric, compressed steel wool, expanded steel lath, etc. It requires sophisticated magnets capable of generating high intensity fields in large volumes of empty space at lower cost and energy expenditure than was previously possible. Superconducting magnets will ultimately be used for larger applications."
"The inductance of one phase conductor of a three-phase supply system is expressed as the mutual inductance between loops formed of this phase and the two other phases then this mutual inductance is calculated as the flux cross-section is divided into small sections for which the flux is computed as flux density in the center of the section times area of the section. The flux density is calculated as by the RENO 100 program. This RENO 100 is transformed into the RENO 400 by sifting out the geometry of the source loop and the field-loop into subroutines. Truncated parts of the field loop require another (truncation) subroutine. As a typical example the inductance of a phase of a three phase busbar system supplying an arc furnace in a steel-work is given."
"A permanent magnet d.c. machine is described, with an axial field and a disc-shaped armature. The potential distribution is calculated in three-dimensions for high-coercivity magnets, for which a uniform intrinsic magnetisation can be assumed. This shows the importance of not assuming a constant potential over the pole surface, and of not reducing the system to two-dimensions. The field in the air-gap is found, and a comparison of magnet shapes shows that commonly used circular poles produce poor values of useful field. A compacted mixture of iron powder and epoxy resin has been found to be a good substitute for laminations in the magnetic circuit. It is shown that this material carries about the same flux in the machine as does mild steel. However, it offers a significant reduction in the eddy-current and hysteresis losses, compared with laminated nickel iron."
"The influence of magnetic cores on the magnetic field of a superconducting split-coil solenoid has been investigated. It is found that the increment in field consists of two parts, one arising directly from the magnetization of the cores, the other from their enhancing effect on the superconducting windings. The spatial distribution of both contributions is calculated and the optimum choice of dimensions of magnetic cores is discussed."
"In the previous work, the authors stated that the performance characteristics of the power converters with the bridge-core circuit or with the bridge-connected reactor circuit which have been made by us are essentially the same as that of the parametric transformer 2,3,4. A good constant voltage characteristic of it is due to the constrained conditions in the magnetic bridge circuit formed in the magnetic cores. In this paper, the performance characteristics of the center-tap reactor circuit which has been derived from the bridge-connected reactor circuit are stated in details. Its performances are divided into four modes, and with each mode the experimental results are compared with those obtained by the computer calculations. As the results of these calculations, the optimum values of the circuit constants are obtained, and the limiting conditions of characteristics are clarified. Moreover, a new power converter has been derived from the above considerations. In the new power converter, one of the reactors in the center-tap reactor circuit is replaced by the parallel ferro-resonance circuit. This small alteration provides the increase in the output power and smaller voltage regulation in the load characteristic."
"The structure of domain walls may be studied theoretically by considering the wall either to be a continuous magnetization distribution (micromagnetic-type approach) or a discrete moment distribution. It is shown that the discrete moment approach becomes necessary in materials of high magnetocrystalline continuous such as SmCo5, where the domain walls are only of the order of 10-20 atomic distances wide. The structure of such walls is found to be very sensitive to short range variations in exchange and anisotropy and the presence of an anomalous exchange interaction between two spins produces pinning fields which are of the same order as values of coercivity in SmCo5. It is concluded that exchange anomalies may play an important role in domain wall pinning in the rare-earth/cobalt materials and that further information on the exchange mechanisms could help to explain their high coercivities."
"The influence of the deviation from stoichiometry on the magnetic properties has been investigated on the compositions given by the formula (NiO)α(ZnO)1-α(Fe2O3)xwhere α = 0.30 ; 0.36 and 0.9 < x < 1.1. The authors describe all the cares needed to prepare such compositions and the tests used before succeeding in obtaining magnetic property values which are characteristic and comparable. The influence of the deviation from stoichiometry upon the initial susceptibility is important near the Curie temperature and over a fairly large temperature range ;it decreases at low temperatures. This influence is also spectacular on the ceramic parameters of the materials (grain growth, density). Concerning other properties, crystallographic (lattice constant) or magnetic (Ms, Tc), the influence of the deviation is much lower but unambiguous. It is the variation of the Curie temperature with x which is responsible for the large susceptibility variations (previously mentionned by other authors at room temperature). The variation of Tccould be related to the variation of the lattice constant with x."
"Nucleation and pinning mechanisms in sintered SmCo5magnets have been investigated using the Kerr magneto-optic effect and conventional demagnetization measurements. It has been shown that changes in the total grain boundary area produced by grinding the sintered material do not correlate directly with the resulting decrease in coercivity. Observations of the domain structures during demagnetization end subsequent remagnetization indicate that most grains are controlled by a type of nucleation which involves immediate reversal of the magnetization of the grain at a critical nucleation field. Evidence is also presented which shows that domain walls can be strongly pinned within grains and that a further increase in the field is required for their removal. There is also considerable asymmetry in the behaviour of individual grains since the application of a given field in one direction produces a different result from that when the field is applied in the opposite direction. Preliminary measurements on the grain boundaries by scanning electron probe micro-analysis show that they are samarium rich."
"A model of the magnetic frequency triplet is described that yields useful design information at a reasonable cost. The model is based on the analysis of an ideal lossless triplet. Simple modifications are introduced to account for the effects of direct and quadrature axis losses. Similarly, a method of including a line filter network is described."
"The hard magnetic properties of RE1-xNdxCo5magnets with RE = MM and Sm have been studied as a function of the Nd-coneentration up to 65 at% Nd of the RE fraction. 'In MM-based magnets of the composition (MM0.85Sm0.15)Co5a maximum of the eoereivity was found for Nd-concentrations between 20 and 30 at% of the rare earths fraction. The magnetic remanence increases steadily with the Nd-concentration in the whole range of composition studied, from 8 KG for 0 at% up to 9.2 KG for 65 at%. A similar behaviour is found for Sm-based magnets. We have also studied the temperature dependence of both coereivity and magnetic remanence as a function of the Nd content. The coereivity-temperature curves of the magnets show a maximum, the position of which depends on the Nd-concentration. With increasing Nd-concentration the maximum is shifted to higher temperatures. This is related to the temperature dependence of the anisotropy field of these alloys which is strongly influenced by Nd-concentration. We also measured the dependence of the coercivity on the angle between the direction of easy magnetization and the applied fields. These measurements are compared with measurements of the primary magnetic properties of (MM1-xNdx)Co5as well as Sm1-xNdxCo5single crystals."
"A review of recent theoretical experimental results on domain walls in thin magnetic films both of prallel anisotropy (permalloy films) and of perpendicular anisotropy (bubble film) is given. For the case of parallel anisotropy good agreement is achieved between theoretical predictions and experimental observations of the three wall types, symmetric and asymmetric Néel walls and asymmetric Bloch walls. We show pictures of asymmetric Néel walls in NiFe single crystal foils. In general, the calculation of a domain wall in a thin film means the calculation of a two-dimensional vector field of unit length under the influence of a long-range, dipolar interaction. Theoretical methods to do this are still clumsy and only very few rigorous calculations have been published. Even models Which avoid the dipolar interaction (stray field free models) cannot be computed straightforwardly. Recent efforts are reviewed together with a proposal for a new approach."
 "Criteria governing the successful application of RE2T17compounds in permanent magnet production are suggested, based upon the experience gained with RECo5materials. The implications of these criteria to both alloy composition and production techniques are illustrated for Sm2(CO1-xFex)17. In this respect the primary magnetic properties of these compounds, derived from single crystal measurements, are presented. The results of initial attempts to produce hard magnetic materials from certain of these materials are reported and analysed in order to identify the major problems still to be overcome."
"Using the singular point detection technique, we have determined the anisotropy field HA= 2(K1+2K2)/Msfor polycrystalline samples of YCo5,CeCO5,PrCo5and ThCo52. Measurements have been made in pulsed magnetic fields up to 200 kOe and over the tamperature range 4.2K-330K. In addition, magnetisation measurements have been carried out on aligned powder samples to enable independent estimates of K1and K2to be made. In the case of YCo5, a broad spectrum of anisotropy fields is apparent with a well defined satellite in some cases, which probably corresponds to the stoichiometric composition. For ThCo5,K2changes sign at about 100K. For PrCo5, the anisotropy field measured here does not agree with the low field anisotropy constants previously reported. This apparent field dependence of anisotropy constants may be due to non-collinear sublattice magnetisation."
"A marked magnetic hardening is observed at room temperature on compositions 35NiFe2O4.65Mn3O4and 30NiFe2O4.70Mn3O4in the binary system NiFe2O4-Mn3O4. From the effects of aging temperature and time upon the magnetic hardening, the measurements of the change of Curie temperature by aging, the results of X-ray and chemical analyses, and microscopic and electron microscopic observations of microstructure, the new findings have been concluded to come from the precipitation of γ-Mn2O3."
"The scanning electron microscope has been used to study the domain contrast in ferrimagnetic oxides including garnets. A systematic attempt has been made to investigate the parameters which influence magnetic contrast, particularly those concerned with the electron collecting system. In addition a phenomenological model has been developed which explains most of the observed contrast and image quality features. As a result it is possible to assess quantitatively the image quality as a function of microscope parameters and hence to choose operating conditions which maximize it."
"Metglas amorphous Fe-Ni base alloy ribbons supplied by Allied Chemical Co., Morristown, N.J., while mechanically strong, are magnetically very soft, with Hcaround 20-100 mOe. About 20 Oe H is necessary to saturate the material in strip form. The remanence is on the order of 1/3 the saturation. Elastic tensile stress of a few N/mm2greatly increases the magnetization in low fields. The stress resulting from winding the ribbon into a toroidal sample changes its behavior, giving a much slower approach to saturation and an increase in Hc. Thus properties achieved in a strip cannot be maintained on simply winding it into a toroid. Reversal takes place in a series of discontinuous jumps, at fields depending on the previous magnetizing field, just as in cobalt-rare-earth particles. Elastic torsion greatly increases Hcand produces a perfectly rectangular loop, again characteristic of nucleation-dominated reversal."
"The vertical section of the Fe-Cr-Co system at 15 wt%Co, 1 wt%Nb and 1 wt%Al was constructed. The extention of the α phase region of the system was sufficient enough to allow for the solution treatment of the alloys at 25∼30 wt%Cr content at any temperature above the α1+α2miscibility gap. After step-tempering, their magnetic properties were given as Br = 11.5∼13 KG, Hc = 500∼600 Oe and (BH)max = 4∼5 MGOe. These values were also achieved by continuous cooling from α phase region. The addition of Nb and Al to Fe-Cr-Co system will facilitate a practical manufacturing for producing Fe-Cr-Co permanent magnets."
"Several designs for the conductors in lumped element circulators have been proposed by the author and others for the purpose of attaining wideband performance or low cost. In this paper, a new approach utilizing capacitive coupling is described along with its experimental performance. In the past, only a simple model was used in the design of the circulator. Here, the imperfect coupling between conductors and the nonreciprocal filling factor are introduced into the design formulas to make them more exact. For wideband design, matching circuits with ordinary capacitors and inductors have been used in the past. In this paper, a new approach is proposed which uses a matching network in which the capacitance decreases inversely with frequency. Material with the required characteristics is shown together with measured parameters. The improvement of a circulator with capacitors made of semiconducting Barium Titanate is also shown."
"A review is given of grinding, the resulting mechanical deformation and the effects on the magnetism of ferrites. The grinding system is divided into components and the laws of material removal are stated with particular emphasis on the role of the forces in the system. From the geometry of horizontal spindle grinding a useful parameter is derived, the continuum chip thickness, that can be used for comparing grinding situations. Under these forces the abrasive particles deform and remove the surface. The various modes of deformation of the material are considered. Due to tensile stresses a brittle mode is found. Moreover, underneath the abrasive particle high compression occurs that allows ductile deformation. The latter mode requires more energy per unit volume of material removed. Deformations occur underneath the abrasive particle, but also in front of it, caused by the impact sound wave, and behind it where the compression has changed into tension. Finally the influence of deformation on magnetization, on permeability, losses and domain patterns is considered."
"Stripe domain structures have been observed in (001) single crystal nickel platelets, using the magnetic colloid technique. Little variation of structure with platelet thickness occurs in the approximate range 0.7-15 μm. Below 0.7 μm the stripe structures are degenerate. The stripe structures observed are consistent with Hubert's theoretical ideas on low stray-field structures of stripe domains."
"The amplitude distributions of mixtures of Gaussian and crosstalk noise, as found in a disc or tape magnetic recording drive (file), have been calculated. Methods are described for modelling the readback process to estimate its susceptibility to noise, and thus to find error rates. These techniques are used for optimizing certain aspects of the file design, and provide an approximate value for the highest achievable areal packing density at any given state of the technology."
"The behaviour of liquid metal, when supported over parts of its surface by an alternating magnetic field, has been examined in controlled conditions by an analogue experimental technique based on sodium immersed in an inert oil of slightly lower density. Experiments have been performed over a wide range of frequency, and with various excitation-system geometries. The ultimate purpose of the work is to identify mechanisms that may limit the size of liquid metal charge capable of stable levitation in an 'electro-magnetic crucible', and that may affect stability in related devices. Various theories are current, and it uncertain which are correct. It has become clear that a particular static stability analysis, based on energy considerations, leads to conclusions which are contradicted by experiment; this matter is now theoretically understood. Dynamic instability of the metal surface is possibly important in practice. Past work on plasma stability is relevant to the subject, but requires extension for the liquld-metal case. This paper briefly reviews the general problem, and then concentrates on the analogue apparatus and experimental results, drawing attention to the main features of observed behaviour."
"Numerical methods are generally applied to induction devices by assuming 2-dimensional geometry, and are difficult to extend to 3 dimensional eddy currents because the field relationships require vector functions, each with 3 interdependent components. A simpler description is sought by replacing the field quantities by two coupled networks, one electric and one magnetic. These provide an insight into the behaviour of the device, since they combine a terminal equivalent circuit with a topological description, and they are suitable for numerical solution. Their key property is their interlinkage. It is shown that this can be manipulated to provide a scalar-potential description of the 3-dimensional eddy-current problem, corresponding to the dynamic equivalent of a magnetic shell. The same approach can be used to derive a variety of equivalent circuits for induction devices and, when applied to a transformer, shows that the magnetising, and not the leakage reactance, should be split into two components. The scalar-potential formulation is particularly simple when applied to thin plates, backed by unsaturated iron, and its validity has been demonstrated by comparing calculated and measured flux distributions around a square copper plate. It is here applied to conductors of large cross-section, and the results compared with the customary vector-potential formulation in 2 dimensions."
"The theory describes a computation method of eddy losses in massive magnetic pieces of electrical machines. The essential cause of eddy losses is the time variation of the magnetic flux flowing tangentially in a very thin surface layer of the pieces. A computation method for that surface flux is proposed. The method is extended to any periodic time variation."
"The dynamical behaviour of an in-plane magnetized stripe-domain in a thin film strip is shown to be strikingly similar to that of a bubble-domain in a single-crystalline platelet. This is supported by theoretical as well as experimental evidence. In particular, several mechanisms of propagating a stripe domain by means of a local magnetic field gradient are discussed. However, from the physical point of view the \"flat\" and the \"true\" bubble differ substantially in two important respects: in the former case, (i) the wall energy plays actually no role - at least in the first approximation, and (ii) no bias field is needed to stabilize the domains (except for very narrow film strips in which a bias field must be used to stabilize the specimen's initial state of magnetic saturation). The above-mentioned similarity applies as well to the multi-domain case in a film strip, though in this case the magnetostatic stabilizing forces are obviously smaller."
"It has been shown recently that the guideway conductors of high-speed trains will have to be segmented in order to keep the eddy losses induced by the large fields of the cryogenic magnets within reasonable limits. This paper describes an experimental program which has demonstrated that the normal stranding used in manufacturing aluminum and copper cables produces sufficient strand isolation, that strand insulation will not be required to keep the eddy losses small. The average measured difference in losses between cables having uninsulated strands and those having insulated strands was only 10 per cent for both the TE and the TM mode for both aluminum and copper cables."
"Techniques and geometries for MIC circulators employing ferrite discs embedded in dielectric substrates have been developed extensively at frequencies ranging from 1 to 40 GHz. This form of fabrication, in which fit of the ferrite disc and finish are important, has proved reliable in use and to be of low cost. At high microwave frequencies microstrip to waveguide transitions are used with quartz substrates, whilst at low frequencies conductor geometry may be modified to reduce overall size of circulators and matching sections. Medium power loads using inserts of barium ferrite have been developed which can be incorporated into the microwave ferrite disc. For extreme environments circulator inserts may be deposited by arc plasma spraying of ferrite powder."
"The influence of the steady magnetic field H on the peak-power handling capability of a junction circulator is studied. Particularly when this magnetic field is above the limit magnetic field Hlim, no nonlinear. effects appear in the junction circulator. This principle of operation has been applied for the study and the realization of three port KU band and four port X and KU band junction circulators with high peak-power handling capability. The use of new Sm-Co5permanent magnets permits the realization of lighter and more compact circulators and differential phase-shift circulators well-known for high-peak power applications."
"A careful comparison between theory and experiment is made for the transverse alternating field eddy current losses in three twisted mlxed-matrix filamentary superconductors of the composition 3CuNi: 3Cu:1NbTi. The measurements were made over a wide frequency range, up to 106Hz."
"Theoretical analysis was made of the magnetic field in the air gap between the attracting magnet and the rail for the electromagnetic levitation of vehicles. Eddy current induced by the magnetic field in the rail weakens the field, particularly near the leading end of the magnet, and decreases the attracting force as the magnet speed becomes higher. Eddy current also generates drag. Analytical solutions of the field equations were derived and formulas for calculating forces were obtained. Magnetic field distribution within the air gap was calculated to show how the excited field is weakened by the eddy current in the rail. Speed characteristics of the magnet, such as attracting force versus speed curves, drag versus speed curves, lift/drag ratio versus speed curves, were calculated, and are compared with some experimental curves. These curves show that speed-characteristics of the attracting magnet can be very superior in a very wide speed range, if it is designed properly. It is shown how parameters, such as magnet length, rail thickness, etc., affect the speed characteristics of the magnet."
"Roth's method for solving two-dimensional boundary value problems has now been extended to 3- dimensional, two-reglon problems in which eddy currents can flow in one of the regions. This has been done by resolving the vector potential of the air-space into 2 parts: One part is called the limiting potential which exists when the eddy-current region is replaced by an infinitely permeable region. This potential is expressed as a triple infinite series in trigonometric functions, the current producing the field being represented by a triple Fourier coefficient. The second component is a modifying potential which together with the eddy currents in the second region has to satisfy all the boundary and interface conditions. All the field and current distributions are obtainedas complex triple infinite series. Tests carried on an experimental model show good agreement with the theoretical results. The theory indicates that the eddy currents in the region of finite ρ will be parallel to the interface between the two regions whatever may be the relative position of the exciting current. Possibilities of further applications of this method to 3-region problems, discontinuous boundaries and linear machines etc are also mentioned."
"Ferrite thin films were prepared in serial process of vacuum evaporation of iron on an alumina substrate, oxidation of iron surface by alkali treatment, conversion to hematite at a high-temperature in air and reduction to ferrite at a low-temperature in hydrogen atmosphere. In the conversion to the hematite above 900°C, the solution of the alumina to the hematite was taken place to give rise to the firm adhesion of the film to the substrate. Magnetic properties of the ferrite thin films hardly depended on the film thickness in the range of 0.6 μm to 1.5 μm. Hc was 400-500 Oe and Br was 3000-2300 G, depending on the temperature of the annealing in air. In recording characteristics, these films considerably exceeded the conventional γ-Fe2O3coating medium."
"The magnetic suspension system makes an ideal facility for the measurement of the aerodynamic Magnus force acting on a wind tunnel model which is spinning about an axis inclined at an angle to the air flow. The Southampton University system was modified to allow the suspended model freedom to spin whilst retaining control of the other rigid body degrees of freedom. Force and moment read-out was obtained from calibration of the suspension electromagnet currents. The model was spun up using air jets and the mechanism retracted leaving the model rotating and free from flow interference. The Magnus force signals were recorded on magnetic tape during the gradual decay of spin rate for subsequent digital analysis. Typical test data is presented showing a strong influence of tail region geometry on Magnus force. This indicates that a mechanical support at the tail should be avoided and illustrates the usefulness of magnetic suspension in aerodynamic testing."
"This paper details the use of computerized magnetic field solutions, based on magnetic vector potential, to optimize rotor slot asymmetries for minimum eddy current losses in strands of stator conductors of turbogenerators due to radial flux. This optimization results in minimum peaks of air gap flux densities and minimum densities in critically saturated parts of the rotor and stator. Loss and saturation reductions as high as 34% and 13%, respectively, were achieved. A 4-pole 659 MVA asymmetrical rotor turbogenerator and a 2-pole 733 MVA standard rotor turbogenerator were used to demonstrate the procedure and results of rotor optimizations. Useful rotor design optimization guide lines, computerized flux plots for the optimum asymmetrical rotors and experimental test results are given."
"Numerical methods, based on a magnetic scalar potential function, have been used to compute three-dimensional leakage fields and leg-plate losses in large power transformers. Fast convergence is obtained. The currents induced in the leg-plate are calculated by a simple modification of the static scalar-potential formulation. This includes three-dimensional, flux perturbation, and plate edge effects. The results show that two-dimensional approximations are unsatisfactory."
"The development of advanced digital magnetic recording systems requires every significant system parameter to be optimally designed since the margins for reliable operation are shrinking very rapidly. The performance of these high density systems is primarily limited by the writing-demagnetization processes which are highly non-linear and interactive. Consequently, design by trial and error is unsatisfactory besides being very time consuming and expensive. Theoretical design and optimization can be fast and efficient, but requires a modeling technique which can accurately simulate the non-linear interactive processes, and incorporate all the frequency and wavelength-dependent effects in the transducer, the medium, and the circuits. The dynamic iterative model meets these criteria and is used in this paper to simulate the performance of advanced digital disk systems. The theoretical predictions are compared to experimental measurements from an IBM 3340 disk system, and the correlation is very good for both the spatial distribution (timing) and the absolute amplitude of the signal response."
"The mechanical properties of filamentary Nb3Sn superconducting composites have been investigated. The effect of reaction conditions and variation of component dimensions on the strain which can be accommodated before loss of current carrying capacity occurs has been determined, Critical strains to failure lie within the range 1-3%. The failure mechanism of Nb3Sn layers is discussed in terms of the fracture mechanics of composite materials. Commercial types of composite consisting, typically, of 1500 filaments in bronze were found to withstand repeated stressing to 3.6 × 108Nm-2in liquid helium without degradation of superconductivity."
"Computer studies of high field superconducting lenses comprised of a superconducting coil and holmium pole pieces (operating close to saturation) are reported. One of the optimized designs has better optical properties than lenses of classical design."
"We have prepared and studied various kinds of sputered Nb-N samples. By changing the preparation conditions we can indeed obtain superconducting samples or on the opposite very resistive samples. In the first case we have studied the behaviour of the slope of the critical field versus temperature curves near Tcand we have shown that(\\frac{dH_{c2}}{dT})_{T_{c}}is a regular increasing function of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter κ. On the other hand have measured the perature dependent resistivity\\rho(T), of the nonsuperconducting samples. The results can be interpreted in terms of hopping conduction in disordered materials, the resistivity indeed fit well Mott's relation,\\rho=\\rho_{0}\\exp(\\frac{T}{T_{o}})^{-1/4}."
"A rapid method for the computation of the magnetic field of permanent magnets in the presence of saturable iron cores is described and experience in using it discussed. This method makes use of finite elements and allows for non-uniform magnetisation in the magnet. The factors affecting convergence are examined."
"The cation distribution of single crystal manganese ferrites Mn1-yFey[MnyFe2-y]O4with0.06 \\leq y \\leq 0.24was modified by appropriate heat treatment at temperatures 300-600°C. With these samples the Curie temperature, the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, the spontaneous magnetization and the differential susceptibility at high magnetic fields were studied. The experiments enabled us to determine the magnitude of the molecular field coefficient NMn(A)-Fe(B)= 89 and to estimate the main part of the contribution to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy in MnFe2O4which was found to come from Fe3+in octahedral sites. High field susceptibility measurements confirmed the applicability of the noncolinear arrangement of magnetic moments in MnFe2O4which supposes that Mn(B) spins make an angle of 53° with the direction of the total magnetization."
"The performance of electrical machines is largely dictated by the action of current and flux in the core length. The field in a cross-section obeys Poisson's equation and approximate solutions have been obtained by finite difference and element methods. The finite difference method requires a large number of nodes and is slow to converge as permeability is variable. The finite element method is more flexible being more readily fitted to iron-air boundaries and has better convergence. However, it is difficult to formulate a legitimate variational formulation for transient conditions in the presence of dissipation. Here, discrete equations are formed by applying Ampere's circuital law around each node. Careful choice of contour lines give a current distribution superior to that obtained with finite elements. Fast convergence is obtained and the method is applicable under transient conditions."
"The response of magnetic tapes to field pulses of durations down to 0.68 ns was measured. The tapes examined included: gamma iron-oxide, cobalt-substituted gamma iron-oxide, chromium-dioxide, and cobalt-phosphorus in particle and continuous film form. The majority of tapes showed a fairly linear relationship with switching speed constants from 0.2 to 0.6 us-Oe when reciprocal time was plotted against pulse field amplitude. No correlation was observed between the response speeds and the common physical or magnetic properties of the tapes. The pulse fields were generated from a strip-line recording head whose response was flat from dc to 3 GHz."
"In electromagnets having rectangular cross-section, the magnetic flux in the airgap is a function of the relations between the geometric dimensions of the exciting coil. Maximum magnetic flux from a given volume can be obtained when the optimum values of the geometric parameters are chosen. The results of the investigation are presented both analytically and graphically in non-dimensional forms for a wide range of electromagnets used in practice."
"The transverse force and flux distributions are examined for the important case of overlapping rectangular poles of saturable material. Results from measurements on physical devices and from numerical iterative solutions of the field equations are presented, with flux plots for varying pole positions. Accuracy, as determined from control cases and other means, is better than 1%. The transverse force is presented in a novel way as a unique function of the three variables, the mmf, the overlap distance, and the saturation polarization of the pole material. This shows that the force is remarkably independent of overlap, and for large overlap is double the force for the corresponding linear case and directly proportional to both the mmf and the saturation polarization."
"A magnetoresistive (MR) head produces high output. A stripe type MR head, however, has poor wave-length response due to its stripe width loss and has limitation in reducing track width due to its configuration. A new MR head, therefore, is proposed here to obtain extremely narrow track width. This head can achieve very high areal density and has no wear problems, since having flux guide cores."
"The properties of hot pressed Sm-Co magnets are compared to those obtained in sintered magnets. Hot pressing was performed several hundred degrees below the normal sintering temperature using powder compacts of three types: (1)isotropic discs, (2)axially aligned discs and (3) radial aligned rings. In all cases densities in excess of 97%, of the theoretical value were obtained which is somewhat higher compared with sintered material. Intrinsic coercivity values, Hci, were between 15 and 20kOe, which is comparable to annealed, sintered magnets. Despite the higher density of the hot pressed samples, values of Brand (BH)maxwere lower than in sintered magnets. Inverse pole figures obtained by x-ray diffraction indicated that the alignment of magnetic poles after hot pressing does not change from that of the original powder compact. This is in contrast to the improvement in alignment as a result of normal sintering, which presumably occurs as a result of well aligned grains growing at the expense of poorly aligned grains. By heat treating aligned, hot pressed magnets at the sintering temperature, a similar improvement in alignment was obtained. Values of (BH)maxas hot pressed and after this heat treatment were 12MGOe and 16MGOe, respectively. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of sintering and grain growth processes as they relate to metallurgical structure and final second quadrant characteristics. In the case of radial ring fabrication, the results are particularly encouraging since hot pressing in a confining die eliminates the distortion and cracking which occurs during sintering."
"The paper discusses the application of the integral transforms method to the analysis of the magnetic field produced by a system of conductors with finite thickness. An example is given for the determination of the magnetic field due to a spherical coil using the Mellin tramsform of the current density distribution function. Obtained formulas for the magnetic field distribution are very useful for numerical computation. In many cases it is necessary to determine the magnetic field of the current flowing in a coil of finite dimensions. It concerns the determination of the field inside and outside the conductors."
"About three years ago, Kaneko et.al described a new permanent magnet alloy system Based on the elements Cr, Fe and Co. Permanent magnets Based on this system can reproduce the properties of many of the alloys of the Al-Ni-Co system. The present work was undertaken to ascertain whether this similarity extended to temperature stability. Alloys of Cr-Fe-Co, including some with additions of Ti,Mo,V or Si were given the heat treatment necessary to produce optimum permanent magnet properties. Tests made on these magnets included measurements of the reversible temperature coefficient around room temperature, variation of coercivity with temperature, the reversible and irreversible magnetic changes up to 500°C. Metallurgical changes at still higher temperatures were also investigated. The Cr-Fe-Co magnets were found to behave very similarly to those of the Al-Ni-Co system and can, therefore, be developed for applications requiring a low temperature coefficient and good performance at high temperatures."
"The instability of magnetic properties of cobalt substituted acicular iron oxides can be reduced without losing the desirable properties in their application as high energy magnetic recording media. It is shown that by introducing small amounts of zinc into these oxides, they become chemically and magnetically stable. This stabilizing effect is produced by the ability of zinc to decrease the crystal anisotropy of the cobalt substituted iron oxides. The degree of chemical stability and the degree of magnetic stability is dependent not only on the zinc content but also on the zinc to cobalt ratio. In addition, tapes prepared from these powders do not show magnetostrictive losses under pressure, as is the case with cobalt substituted iron oxides."
"Single crystals of Zn doped lithium ferrite have been obtained by the classical flux melt under argon oxygen pressure. Magnetic properties and microwave measurements have been performed. It Appears that the single ion anisotropy model is valid for a small amount of zinc."
"Very fine barium ferrite powders exhibiting good magnetic properties were recently produced by IMI (Israel Mining Industries) employing a special thermochemical process. Conventional sintering of these powders considerably lowered their magnetic properties. A hot-pressing process was therefore developed which yielded dense bulk samples of good magnetic properties. The optimal conditions of this process were found to be: temperature, T = 1000°C, pressure, P = 400 kg/cm2and duration time, t = 5 sec. Under these conditions a minimum average grain size of 0.5 μm was achieved giving rise to an intrinsic coercivity ofIHc=4.32 kOe. Partial orientation effects of the hot-pressing process raised the remanence value from Br=1.36 kG for the powder to Br=2.88 kG for the hot-pressed bulk sample."
"This paper presents the steady state performance characteristics of the LSM fed from a voltage-source frequency converter. A model, similar to the one used for conventional synchronous motor analysis, has been used to study the steady state behaviour of the LSM system. The results of the following investigations are discussed in this paper: Effects of various section lengths of the guideway winding on the performance characteristics of the LSM system, behaviour of the LSM system at different speeds, and a comparative study of the Linear Induction Motor (LIM) and LSM systems."
"Magnetic after-effect and induced uniaxial anisotropy investigations have been carried out on lithium ferrite polycrystalline samples of initial compositions Li0.5+xFe2.5-xO4(-0.05 \\leq x \\leq 0. 10). A directional order phenomenon has been observed, which is attributed to the migration of interstitial lithium. This phenomenon is characterized by an after-effect band at about 240°K and the creation of an uniaxial anisotropy of about 90 erg/cm3, which corresponds to 2.5×1019interstitial lithium per cubic centimeter."
"The Wolfson experimental maglev vehicle being built at the University of Warwick is to be levitated and guided over a track consisting of two flat parallel conducting sheets. The advantages of this system are discussed and measurements of forces and moments for the proposed coil configuration are shown. The condition for static stability is determined and the possibility of obtaining desirable roll characteristics under cornering and cross wind conditions by manipulation of track and vehicle geometry discussed. The system is shown to be stable for small perturbations."
"It was previously shown that the application of high-amplitude high-frequency drive fields to epitaxial garnet films affects the properties of the walls to give increased hysteresis, and peculiar modes of oscillation in low frequency test fields. Microscopic observations can also be made to show the behaviour of the walls in the high frequency fields themselves for direct correlation with measurements of magnetization amplitude and phase versus drive field amplitude. A rapidly progressive and irregular pinning of the walls is observed in a critical field region. The low frequency observations do not indicate corresponding high frequency modes of oscillation but are relevant to the interpretation of the results in terms of cumulative Bloch line formation."
"As the magnetic recording reproducing process can be assumed to be a kind of transmission line, the reproducing head shape is considered as one of the waveform transformation elements. This is known as a gap loss function for conventional heads. But such an analytical expression has not been obtained yet for recently proposed thin film heads with finite pole-tip length, comparable to the recorded wave length. This paper discusses the peak shift characteristics of finite length heads through a proposed approximate analytical expression for them, et al. suggests the possibility that peak shift of finite length heads exceeds that of infinite length ones, despite of the fact that finite length heads are generally said suitable for high density recording."
"A 1/25-scale Magneplane system with superconducting coils is described. The vehicle is 1 m long, has a 20-cm circular cross section, and weighs, without liquid helium, 14 kg. It is supported by inductive maglev at high speeds and propelled by a linear synchronous motor. The outdoor guideway with accelerating, cruising, and decelerating sections is 116 m long."
"A repulsive levitation system consisting of a finite number of vehicle coils and an infinite number of short circuited coils on the ground is treated with two degrees of freedom. All self- and mutual inductances are calculated three-dimensionally. A set of seven simultanious differential- and integral equations is obtained, which is solved numerically. As an example, a nullflux system for a high speed train with 150 and 500 km/h has been investigated. At the steady state, the losses, lift- and traction forces and their pulsations have been calculated. Transients due to sudden wind forces or track irregularities are also dealt with. The damping of the vehicle oscillations due to disturbances becomes poorer with increasing vehicle speed."
"The theoretical analyses of the repulsive magnetic levitation system for high-speed ground transport have so far treated only steady-state equilibrium conditions. This paper presents an experimentally verified dynamic circuit theory formulation which can cope will electromechanical time transients as well."
"The effect on ride quality of levitating a vehicle with inductive maglev forces which are distributed along the length of the vehicle is described. For a Magneplane vehicle that is 50 m long traveling at 100 m/s, the effect is to substantially attenuate heave disturbances above 1.5 Hz and pitch disturbances above 3 Hz."
"We give a chart mostly useful for heating and cooling Mn-Zn-ferrites with a constant oxidation degree. This chart has five different scales : a logarithmic one for PO2(arm), temperature (I/T), scales for Fe2O3and MnO contents (mole %) and another one for the oxidation degree. In the composition range given, with fixed values of PO2and T, the accuracy is better than an absolute error of ± 0.1 weight % Fe2+which corresponds to an absolute error of ± 0.002 for the parameter γ. We emphasize the care that must be taken to reach a real equilibrium due to the existence of a phase boundary and of metastable region. This chart has been calculated using two equilibrium constants derived from our experimental studies. Experimentally, the curves log PO2= f(1/T) are straight lines with the same slope whatever the composition. This slope corresponds to the enthalpy of transfer of one mole oxygen from the solid phase to the gas phase (ΔH= 66.5 Kcal.)"
"Calculations of the anhysteretic magnetic behaviour of uniaxial domain arrays have hitherto treated the domain walls as laminar structures of constant energy density. A more general expression for the free energy of a strip domain array is derived, which includes the asymptotic wall width as a floating parameter. This is used to indicate the variation of the wall width with film thickness and material parameters and to investigate effects in specimens with low anisotropy fields."
"In this paper we investigate the influence of hydrostatic pressure (up to 1000 bar) on the magnetization mechanisms of spinel polycrystalline ferrites. The results presented here have been obtained on the composition Ni.36Zn.64Fe2O4. We show that : - the inverse of the initial susceptibility increases linearly with the pressure, - both the critical field Hcr, where the susceptibility begins to increase sharply, and the field Hmcorresponding to the maximum of susceptibility, increase also linearly with the pressure. Similar laws have been found for the same composition at other temperatures, as well as for different compositions, - a new phenomenon has to be noted : a \"pressure induced hysteresis\" of the initial susceptibility, - the initial magnetization curves for different pressures can be reduced to a single curve by taking into account the ratio H/Hcr(where Hcris the critical unpinning field for the domain walls). The interpretation is based on a model previously proposed by Globus."
"Evaluation of the distortion resulting from imperfect biasing of a magnetoresistive (MR) read head shows that it is unacceptable in wide band recording systems. A general solution to the problem is presented which involves differentially sensed elements. A practical implementation and performance of a shielded head is discussed. Analytical techniques are shown for designing current-biased MR heads, which allow predictions of performance closely matching experimental results."
"A short review of bias methods for the magnetoresistive head (MRH), all based on the rotation of the magnetization, is given, and the properties of the various methods are discussed. A novel bias method is proposed which avoids many disadvantages of the former since it is based on the rotation of the current with the aid of slanted conductors, covering the MRH. Measured and calculated static curves are given for this new configuration, for which the name \"Barber Pole\" is proposed. The Barber Pole turns out to be more linear than a field-biassed MRH. The wavelength response of a Barber Pole is calculated and found to be very similar to that of a normal MRH; this is confirmed by measurements. A two terminal track sensing head, based on the new biassing principle is described."
"Hysteresis loops of thin MnBi films on mica and on glass show that a relationship exists between film thickness and nucleation field. Generally, It appears to be impossible to calculate nucleatlon fields of magnetic materials since these fields depend on materials imperfections which introduce unknown free energy contributions. The present work shows that for MnBi films a theory can be developed with which the nucleation fields can be calculated. Measurements of the nucleation fields Hnand calculated values are in good agreement with each other."
"The wavelength dependence of the ac biased recording sensitivity is calculated utilizing a model in which both longitudinal and vertical record fields are considered. Even though the effects of demagnetization fields and spreads in particle switching fields are neglected, the calculation yields excellent quantitative agreement with measurements on extremely well-oriented CrO2and γFe2O3magnetic tapes."
"The thermal spike frequency of magnetoresistive sensors is investigated as a function of average head/tape flying height. A qualitative relationship between particular thermal spikes and surface defects is shown to exist and insight is gained into the nature of \"flying\" at submicron spacings. Results for clear and oxide coated surfaces of varying surface topography are discussed."
"The observed conditions for homogeneous second-order stripe domain nucleation in uniaxial garnet films has previously been interpreted by a generalization of Neel's 1946 phase theory that yields values of the anisotropy constants from the observations, We show that a micromagnetic description of the phenomena yields additional detailed predictions of the domain orientation. These can be correlated with the films' anisotropic and magnetoelastic properties. The predicted behavior is consistent with earlier observations reported in the literature, and provides a good description of new measurements reported here."
"Phases with the stoichiometry R5Co19have been observed in the rare earth-cobalt systems with R = La, Ce, Pr, and Nd. These phases may play a significant role in the development of coercive force in RCo5-based permanent magnets containing the light rare earths, particularly mischmetal. The present paper reports Curie temperatures, saturation magnetizations, and the results of anisotropy field measurements made on alloy powders of these phases."
"The temperature dependence of ihe coercive field was measured on low-temperature phase MnBi single crystals between room-temperature and the Curie point. The wall-nucleation field Hnincreases more than one order of magnitude over this temperature range and values for Hnas high at 6-10 kOe were observed. This dependence of Hnon temperature is reversible with thermal cycling and the transition from a wall-motion-type hysteresis to a nucleation-type hysteresis is attributed to a temperature-dependent concentration of defects in the material. The results are compared with recent work on polycrystalline MnBi thin films and single crystal platelets."
"Magnetic semihard Co-Fe-Ni-alloys with additions of aluminium and titanium were investigated by measurements of coercive force and magnetization as a function of aging and measuring temperature as well as by electron microscopy. The coercive force is due to the α and γ phase precipitates having shape anisotropy and different saturation magnetization. It is shown that for alloys with up to 30 wt.-% Co content the variation of the coercive force is predominantly determined by the term\\DeltaJ\\min{s}\\max{2}/J_{m}in the equationH_{c}=P(1-p)\\DeltaN \\cdot \\DeltaJ\\min{s}\\max{2}J_{m}given by Stoner and Wohl-farth. For alloys with Co content more than 30% however the coercive force is mainly influenced by the shape anisotropy of the precipitates."
"Amorphous bulk samples of Fe-Co-Ni-P were prepared by continuous electroless deposition in the form of hollow cylinders 6mm diameter, 20mm length and with a uniform thickness of the order 0.2mm. The specimens had a general formula NiwCoxFeyPz, with a range of compositions given by 0< w< 0.81; 0 < x < 0.92; 0 < y < 0.10; 0.06 < z < 0.25. The room temperature magnetostriction and the temperature dependence of the saturation magnetisation of the amorphous samples were measured. A number of the samples were heat treated to obtain a single phase crystalline material, the heat treatment conditions being determined by differential scanning calorimetry. The magnetisation values showed a composition dependence similar to that of crystalline alloys of Ni-Co and Ni-Fe. The magnetostriction coefficients, however, were all negative in sign, unlike the behaviour observed in polycrystalline alloys of Ni-Co and Ni-Fe. The magnetostriction values for the amorphous samples were found to be roughly twice the magnitude of those for the crystallised samples. A qualitative explanation of this phenomenon is given based on the lower value of Young's modulus which has been observed in amorphous materials."
"The anomalous non-linear behavior of the power losses per cycle P/f vs. frequency f has been investigated in various materials: oriented and nonoriented FeSi 3%, FeSi 6%, mild steel, pure Fe, ultraperm, mumetal, FeNi 50-50 alloys, and FeCo 50-50. Measurements were performed down to very low frequencies, typically between 1 and 80 Hz, by means of a specially designed high precision wattmeter, under controlled sinusoidal flux conditions. The non-linearity anomaly is found to be a rather general phenomenon, not only limited to the well known case of Goss - texture FeSi, and to be particularly strong on transverse laminations of oriented FeSi 3%, on cubic texture FeSi and on FeNi 50-50. It further appears to be very pronounced at very low frequencies: in this region the models which relate the non-linearity to changes of stripe domain spacing with frequency seem somewhat inadequate, since they would require variations of domain spacings much too large than apparently observed so far. It is suggested that local flux distortions may qualitatively justify at least in part the strong non-linearity of P/f vs. f, in the very initial frequency range."
"The magnetic properties of the pseudo-binary alloy system Nd1-xSmxCo5were investigated to determine the compositional dependence of the anisotropy constants and the saturation magnetization. The anisotropy constants K1and K2of the alloy system were not linearly dependent on composition, suggesting that the single-ion model of anisotropy is not applicable for this System. The deviation from linear behavior could be fitted to an equation from sub-regular solution theory, giving K1=-67×107+96×107x+6×107x2(1-x)+ 108×107x(1-x)2ergs/cm3and K1=35×107-35×107x+43×107x2(1-x)-104×107x(1-x)2ergs/cm3at 4.2°K. However, the magnetization was found to be linearly dependent on composition in this system and is given by Ms(0)=1122-145.9x emu/cm3."
"An investigation has been made on the effects of a dc bias field applied to Gd1-xCOxthin films during rf sputter deposition. Such films may possess uniaxial magnetic anisotropy with easy axis perpendicular to the plane of the film and may be used in magnetic bubble devices. Uniformity in composition, thickness and magnetic properties has been achieved and film composition has been controlled to within one percent. However, significant variations of magnetic properties were observed from film to film."
"A range of broadband lumped element circulators has been designed and developed in the VHF/UHF bands by considering the bandwidth limitations imposed by the ferrimagnetic material properties at these low frequencies. Selection of suitable materials consistent with the demands of the basic circulator junction design yields broadbandwidths with low transmission loss using filter matching techniques. An extension of these techniques allows the tailoring of the out-of-band response to provide a predictable degree of rejection at harmonic frequencies."
"This paper describes the design and performance of three microwave integrated circuit subassemblies which employ ferrite substrates. They are: a stabilised X-band Gunn oscillator suitable for local oscillator applications; a Doppler intruder module operating at X-band and a non-degenerate parametric amplifier at X-band pumped at Q-band. The advantages of using a single ferrite substrate (i.e. maximum integration) for a single frequency unit such as the oscillator and Doppler unit are demonstrated. For a subassembly such as the parametric amplifier it is shown that there are serious limitations to using a single ferrite substrate and it is more satisfactory to use separate, butt jointed substrates."
"The results of some measurements of the magnetic properties of metastable, vapour quenched films of nickel, cobalt and their alloys are presented. The reduced magnetization of the films in their amorphous and crystalline states has been obtained as a function of temperature and estimates of the phase transformation temperatures and Curie temperatures have been made from the magnetic and some electrical resistance measurements. Changes in the magnetization of the crystalline phase are discussed in terms of theories of superpara-magnetism. Finally the magnetization of the amorphous state is discussed qualitatively in terms of previously obtained structural data for the single element films."
"Based on Hines' assumptions a numerical study of the edge mode propagation in a ferrite stripline isolator is described. Bandwidth, insertion loss and isolation are exhaustively analyzed. The correlation with experimental results is excellent. It is shown that the characteristic can be improved to an insertion loss less than 0.4 dB."
"This paper briefly summarizes various pulse-slimming methods for enhancing magnetic recording signals. It then describes the compensation methods used in a recently announced mass storage system. The advantages of the new methods of compensation are compared with previous methods. A key feature of the new design is a basic pulse-slimming block that enables the leading and trailing edges of an isolated read pulse to be slimmed independently. This, combined with an integrator to convert peaks to zero crossings, equalizes the phase and amplitude of the recording channel."
"Low-field magnetic properties of amorphous ferromagnetic alloys have been previously reported mainly at d.c. The alloys in ribbon form generally show square hysteresis loops, with coercive fields less than 0.1 Oe, and with saturation magnetization up to 17000 G. Maximum magnetization is obtained in low fields only when the ribbons are under tensile stress. This paper reports further measurements on amorphous magnetic alloys, including differential scanning calorimeter data on the crystallization of three compositions and a variety of a.c. measurements on toroidal samples at frequencies up to 2000 Hz. The coercive fields and magnetic losses under a.c. excitation are disappointingly high. This is attributed to an increase in coercive field when straight ribbon is wound into toroidal form, and to a further increase in Hcwith frequency due to an apparent decrease in the number of domain walls participating in the magnetization reversal. Neither effect is necessarily inherent in amorphous magnetic materials."
"Substitution of Ni for Co is proposed in order to improve the properties of Gd-Co amorphous films in bubble applications. For a fixed Gd to transition metals ratio, the compensation temperature does not change appreciably and the Curie Temperature decreases from 880° K to 750° K for 50 % of Ni. The absolute saturation magnetization gives no evidence of change for Co and Ni atomic moments. For a 50 % Ni substitution, the room temperature dependence of the magnetization with the Gd concentration drops from 800 G per At % to 300 G per At %, and the magnetization is reduced by a factor of 2 for a given value of the characteristic length."
 "Assuming that domain walls are straight and infinitely thin, it is possible to derive a system of equations of motion for any number of domain walls in thin film strips with in-plane magnetization. Considering the influence of the demagnetizing fields, the \"pulsed motion' of domains in a field with constant field gradient is analysed analytically and numerically by these equations that hold true for any position- and time-dependent fields. The theoretically expected dependence of the domain velocity on pulse frequency and amplitude is discussed. If there are several domains, one must take into consideration additional interactions between each other. Those interactions appear in form of an effective internal field difference ΔHwin case of two neighboring domains. The criteria for moving as under during the pulsation are discussed. In comparison with a single domain neighbouring domains change the Hw-dependence on domain width. Smaller remanent domain width and a reduced collapse field for domains result from this."
"Manganese-zinc ferrites of relatively high iron content were prepared. The content of ferrous iron was controlled by suitable substitution, thus shifting the second permeability maximum and the minimum of the losses into the range of 60 to 120 °C. These ferrites were found to exhibit high Curie temperature and saturation polarization."
"The design and material requirements are presented for a permanent magnet biased magnetoresistive (MR) stripe for high resolution MR recording transducers. Preparation details of three alternative biasing films (Fe3O4the preferred choice) as well as implementation and-testing of experimental transducers are described."
"This paper describes a microwave experimental study of the phase coefficient of magnetodynamic waves guided along a circular convex edge of a conducting film on a perpendicularly-magnetised ferrimagnetic substrate. The experiment consists of measuring the microwave resonance frequencies of a 10 mm radius gold disc on a O.5mm thick polycrystalline YIG plate, and identifying the azimuthal mode numbers 'n'. The measured dispersion curves for the edge-guided waves are compared with the theoretical results of de Santis. The measured phase velocities are found to be significantly greater than the theoretical values. The discrepancy may be caused by the theoretical assumption of a perfect magnetic wall at the disc edge. The experimental study is relevant to the design of miniature edge-wave nonreciprocal components that are being realised with instantaneous bandwidths much greater than an octave, e.g., 5-15 GHz."
"An electronic tachometer system used as a velocity transducer for the track-accessing control system of a disk file is described. Rather than employing a conventional moving magnet and fixed-coil velocity transducer, this electronic tachometer combines information from the servo head position signal and from the actuator motor current to generate an accurate measurement of actuator velocity. Transducer bandwidths of several kilohertz, together with good calibration accuracy and linearity, are obtained over the 100:1 dynamic range of 0.013 to 1.3 meters per second."
"This study describes a method for increasing the life of a particular recording head through a material development approach. Cylindrical specimens that approximate the actual head contour are used to evaluate several non-magnetic coating materials for wear resistance. The fabrication requirements associated with these materials, and the many facets of system performance are discussed. The best overall results for the simulated head are achieved with the aluminum-oxide and titanium-dioxide coating."
"The FMR linewidth of the 210-, 110-and 220-magnetostatic modes in a highly polished and annealed polycrystalline YIG sphere have been measured as a function of frequency at different temperatures. From these results a separation into anisotropy and porosity induced line broadening contributions was accomplished. The results show that both line broadening contributions arise mainly from scattering to low and medium k states of the spinwave manifold. Excellent quantitative agreement was found with Schlömann's anisotropy broadening theory over the whole range of the spinwave manifold covered by the investigated modes. The obtained porosity broadening contribution contradicts the theoretical predictions using the density of spinwave states as a scattering reservoir. A qualitative explanation of this result can be given by taking into account the dispersion of the spinwave angle Θ0."
"Operational reliability problems associated with the materials and packaging of current batch-fabricated head designs are described as they are used in digital tape drive applications. Using ferrite as the basic head material a design is presented, that successfully meets the reliability conditions."
"The arc plasma spraying (APS) technology has demonstrated the capability of being economical in the fabrication of non-reciprocal ferrite phase shifter elements. It has been possible to arc plasma spray a C-band element in less than 10 minutes using a commercial spray dried lithium ferrite powder. This paper discusses the material properties (coercive force, remanence, and microwave loss) of the deposited lithium ferrite and the device performance (differential phase shift and insertion loss) of arc plasma fabricated phase shifter elements. The effects of stresses, generated by a mismatch of thermal coefficient of expansion between the ferrite and the dielectric are also discussed."
"Samples of polycrystalline YIG have been doped at various concentrations with terbium and dysprosium. The effects on spin wave linewidth, ΔHk, effective linewidth, W, and resonance field shift, S, have been measured and compared. An empirical relation between the spin wave linewidth, the spin wave vector, and doping concentration is given with rare earth dependent constants. It has been observed that in the low field region the behaviour of W is consistent with coupling to high k spin waves (wavelength\\sim0.1 \\mum). Almost exactly the same behaviour has been observed in the high field region. Within the degenerate region the relative effects of the two rare earths were reduced. No changes in either the shape or magnitude of the S behaviour were observed. The conclusions are that the rare earth doping does not affect the degenerate coupling and that within the degenerate region both rare earth relaxation and polycrystalline inhomogeneity relaxation are effective. It is suggested that the high and low field behaviour of W can be explained if there exist localised, near atomic scale inhomogeneities producing coupling to very high k vector spin waves. More detailed quantitative analysis is required to verify this."
"Magnetically tunable filters operating in the 18-26.5 and 26.5-40 GHz frequency ranges have been constructed with spherical single crystal Ba3Zn2- Fe24O41(Zn2Z) resonators. Substantial reduction in the external magnetic field required for resonance (Ho) has been achieved by making use of the large anisotropy field (Ha) of Zn2Z. The design and performance of two-resonator Zn2Z filters which tune the 18-26.5 and 26.5-40 GHz frequency ranges are described. By using measured values for the saturation magnetization (Ms), Ha, and resonance linewidth (ΔH), the calculated filter 3 dB bandwidth (BW) and loss are 220 MHz and 6.4 dB respectively at 26.5 GHz. Experimentally measured filter performance characteristics reported herein are in substantial agreement with these calculations."
"Magnetostatic surface wave (MSSW) propagation loss and ferrimagnetic resonance linewidth of thin films of liquid phase epitaxy yttrium iron garnet were measured in the frequency range 2 to 9 GHz. With increasing frequency, both the loss and linewidth initially decreased to a minimum value at about 3 GHz and thereafter increased linearly with frequency. The measurements are in agreement with recent predictions of Vittoria and Wilsey; namely, there is a direct correspondence between MSSW propagation loss and magnetic damping at all frequencies."

 "Two series of tapes were coated to investigate the effect of switching field distribution (SFD) and intrinsic coercivity (Hci) on audio recording properties. In the first series the concentration of γ-Fe2O3was varied by dilution with α-Fe2O3. The SFD, which increased with the amount of α-Fe2O3present, had a large effect on the linear recording range. Signal loss associated with SFD was separated from demagnetization loss. In the second series γ-Fe2O3was blended with different amounts of cobalt doped γ-Fe2O3in order to vary Hci. The ratio of short wavelength saturated output to sensitivity expressed in volts was proportional to Hci."
"VTR ferrite head wear Wragainst CrO2is investigated as a function of δ in single crystals of Ni0.669Fe2.331O4+δ. Two kinds of CrO2tape are used: one with calendered smooth surface(c-tape) and the other with coarse surface(n-tape). Knoop hardness Hkis measured to correlate Wrand Hk. Although Hkincreases with δ, Wrhas a minimum value for the c-tape and a maximum for the n-tape near δ=0. It is concluded from the microscopic observations of the worn surface that the head surface is damaged with brittle fracture in the shape of stripes with a width of about 10 μm due to stress from tape, resulting in wear. It is pointed out that the δ dependence of Wrshould be decided by the nature of the plastic work in Orowan theory. A modified Orowan theory is proposed in order to understand the crystal geometric dependence of the head surface on Wr."
"We have presented calculations of write field from an integrated head. These approach was based on a micromagnetism analysis. We have shown that it was possible to modify the magnetic potential on finite pole tips surface, in order to minimize the extra-pulse effect caused by negative trailins pde fields, by changing the multilayered structure of pole tips. The purpose of this paper is to show the practical recording efficiency of such structure. We have chosen tape recording, because the phenomenon is more significant on thick recording medium. Like conventional heads, it is the last gap corner field in regard to the tape motion which gives the magnetization distribution in the medium. On a integrated head it's the last pole piece field which drive the tape magnetization. When the write head is symmetric in regard to its gap axis (y), it appears as read-back distortion due to the magnetization distribution in the medium. If we change the multilayered structure only on the writing (last) pole tip, the magnetization distribution in the medium is modified, and the distortion can be made to disappear. It's of course a write phenomenon because the read head is symmetric and the same in the both cases. A discussion explains why the distortion with symmetric write heads is more significant when there are transitions interacting."
"Thermally induced voltage pulses have been reported by Gorter et al. in the output of magneto-resistive reading heads. To reduce this thermal noise, Gorter et al. added a second magnetoresistive element on the same substrate but with a large head-to-tape distance. The outputs of these two stripes are differentially amplified to reject common mode noise. A theoretical analysis is made of the heat flow in magnetoresistive heads due to frictional heat generated at the head/tape interface. This model predicts that the dual stripe geometry will be effective for thermal noise cancellation only for low tape velocity or low thermal noise frequency and/or high thermal diffusivity substrate/cover material for the magnetoresistive elements. This result is also expected to be qualitatively valid for thermal noise due to intermittent cooling by the tape of Joule heat generated in the magneto-resistive elements."
"The design considerations, fabrication steps and test results are described for a 16K bit, major-minor loop bubble memory chip with an active area of 0.02 in<sup>2</sup>. The design includes a thin film chevron expanded detector and a double Y-bar transfer gate which does not require electrical insulation and which has been fabricated permalloy-first. The circuit has been successfully tested at 100 KHz using YEuTm as the bubble material. The transfer gate with a margin of 5 Oe at a rotating field of 40 Oe limits performance."
"The design and operation margins of a bubble memory chip 2,8 mm × 2,1 mm with 32 minor loops of 128 bits of storage capacity each are described. In a special package, designed for test purposes and containing the drive field coils and a variable bias magnet system, signals up to 10 mV are generated by bubbles of 6 μm diameter in a thin film detector. The X-bar propagation works well up to 500 kHz using garnets having the composition Y1,6Sm0,4Ca1Fe3,9Ge1Si0,1O12. Also the transfer is performed by special X-bar transfer gates."
"A binary switch has Been proposed to steer two bubble streams to either cross or bypass each other under external electronic control. A linear array of bubble shift register loops can be linked together by these flow-steering switches to form a storage structure which will be called a bubble ladder. It is shown that the ladder can alternate between two data structures - LIFO and FIFO. For storage units based on the ladders, a scheme is developed to rearrange data items according to recency of usage for improving average access time."
"In an attempt to unify digital recording theory, the principal ideas concerning pulse response, linear superposition, medium properties, head geometry, channel codes, signal-to-noise ratio, post-equalization and achievable bit densities are discussed."
"A simple formula is given which describes the magnetization distribution recorded in magnetic tapes. This is more realistic than the usualM = M_{o}\\sin wxin that it contains both longitudinal and normal components of magnetization. The corresponding output voltages are shown to be higher while the self-demagnetizing fields are lower than in the usual case."
"It has been deduced from the analysis of recording demagnetization mechanism in magnetic recording that in short wavelengths the remanent magnetization exhibits a closed-loop structure in the recording medium. In this paper a novel experimental method is presented to confirm the existence of such structure (a circular magnetization mode) and to investigate its mechanism for usual recording medium and heads. The transformation of magnetization from a circular mode to a perpendicular mode is also discussed."
"The single pulse read back from an isolated magnetization transition in a digital magnetic recording system represents one of the most significant and revealing characterizations of the system's resolution and signal response. Whereas it lacks information on recording demagnetization and interaction demagnetization - two phenomena which are particularly critical at high bit packing densities - it does contain much information on self-demagnetization, spacing losses, and transducer and circuit losses. Much of the missing information on interaction effects can be obtained from the waveform of two closely packed transitions. In this paper we studied both the isolated pulse and the two pulse response of many different disk systems and compared the results to predictions from various theoretical models. The best agreement in both amplitude and spatial distribution is obtained by the Dynamic Iterative Model."
"The read process has been studied in three dimensions for a film head by means of a large-scale model. It is shown that the readback voltage pulse can be obtained by simulating a magnetization impulse, using a narrow rectangular current loop with its plane perpendicular to the medium surface, and measuring the head flux generated by it. The on-track signal is compared with the sensitivity function for infinite head and track width, obtained analytically by Potter, et al [3]. It is found that the relative magnitude of the negative undershoot increases with decreasing head width as long as the head and track are about equally wide. By making the read head narrower than the written track, the pulse width is increased and the undershoot reduced. The off-track signal pulse is considerably wider than the on-track pulse, which explains why long wavelengths cause higher adjacent track noise than short ones."
"It is shown that the anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) of magnetic tapes as a function of field strength can be represented by an universal curve in a coordinate system whose ordinate is ARM divided by the ARM saturation value and whose abscissa is the field divided by the value necessary to produce an ARM which is equal to one half of ARM-saturation. A corresponding relationship is shown to hold for actual ac bias analog recording. From the non linear characteristic of ARM the third harmonic distortion, k3, in analog recording is calculated and compared with experiment. It is concluded and verified experimentally that for magnetic coatings with thickness comparable to the write head gap length the signal at constant k3is proportional to the remanent saturation flux-of the coating."
"To improve the understanding of the bubble domain propagation a stroboscopic investigation of bubble displacement with a permalloy T-bar overlay was undertaken at various values of drive field rotation rate. In addition to stepwise change of bubble wall velocity, variation distortion of the bubble shape in the process of propagation and an asynchronous lag of the bubble relative to the drive field vector were also observed, the lag increasing with the rotation rate. To explain these results a simplified method for determining the bubble position in a magnetostatic well was proposed whereby elements of the permalloy overlay was divided into elementary rectangular components. The computed data are in good agreement with the experimental findings and this permits explanation of a number of phenomena observed in bubble circuits."
"A theoretical model for bubble propagation under T-bar type overlays due to an in-plane rotating field is developed. By making certain assumptions about the nature of the overlay magnetisation, it is shown that bubble driving forces can be readily calculated for a circular bubble of varying diameter moving freely in 2-dimensions. Expressions for the frictional forces acting on a bubble are derived and the resulting equations are solved to yield the bubble centre trajectory, the radius, velocity and phase variations. This analysis is applied to examine bubble propagation along a straight portion and around a corner of a T-bar circuit. Cases of successful propagation of an isolated bubble, as well as of failure to propagate, are given. Bias margins for a straight T-bar track at 100 kHz are obtained theoretically and compared with experimental results for a chip having the same parameters."
"Progress in element and chip design of single-mask bubble chips, based on drive-field operation, is reported. Three new elements, which have been successfully operated, are presented. (i) The replicator copies bubble streams for one propagation direction; when used in combination with the sense of rotation of the drive field it can serve as a bit generator. (ii) The λ-creator can selectively shift a bit over one propagation period. It can be applied in a decoder organization which permits rapid access to stored information. (iii) A current-controlled splitter-type generator was designed, which takes current pulses of about 60 mA for creating new bubbles."
"Bubble domain memory chips with micron dimension patterns have been fabricated by additive electroplating through photoresist windows using the conductor first processing. Etching defines the detector strips and removes the plating base. The various fabrication steps are described and discussed. The uniformity of the plated films is good and gives a reasonable yield. Nonmagnetic underlayers were plated below the NiFe bars. The gap width could be reduced by overplating the photoresist windows. 4 kbit chips have been fabricated with the processes described."
"A low-temperature, all-vacuum process combined with electron-beam lithography suitable for single-level masking devices using 2-μm diameter amorphous bubble films has been developed. A test vehicle which uses 0.75-μm wide chevrons and 1-μm wide T.I bars in an 8,000- bit chip configuration, resulting in an areal density of 1×107bits/in2, was used. Important process features are found to be: (1) laminated NiFe films to obtain low Hcand high magneto-resistive effect when deposited at low substrate temperature, (2) maintenance of low surface temperature during metallization to preserve the integrity of exposed and developed electron-beam resist pattern, and (3) proper resist profile for ease of the lift-off process. Excellent bubble device operating characteristics have been obtained as a result of uniformity in materials and structure resulting from careful control of fabrication parameters."
"Operation of all functions in an 8000 bit bubble domain device with 107bit/in2storage density on an amorphous film has been achieved. High frequency data clearly establishes 1 MHz operation in the amorphous films and large wall velocities indicate that frequencies in excess of 10 MHz may be possible. Replicate-transfer switches were made to operate with currents of 12 ma and chevron expander detectors produced 3 mv signals from the 2 μm domains. Relationships between materials characteristics and device performance are established and discussed."
"Using fast response detecting and recording equipment the breakdown voltage spectra of thin film dielectrics (with a GdCoMo first electrode and permalloy counter-electrode) were measured as a function of time and temperature during application of linearly increasing (ramp) voltages. For 1000 Å thick SiO2films the dielectric breakdown events occurring at high voltages were seen to be strictly voltage-dependent, whereas those breakdowns occurring at low voltages exhibited a definite time-dependence in addition to a voltage-dependence. In this low voltage region slowly increasing voltages (low ramp rates) resulted in significantly greater numbers of cumulative failures, for a given attained voltage, than did rapidly increasing voltages. This time-dependence, transformed through a simple kinetic power law to a constant applied voltage experiment was found to be consistent with Peek's law of dielectric breakdown. The data and analysis suggest that reliable device operation will not be achieved if electric fields in excess of 0.6 × 106V/cm are applied across the dielectric."
"A new packaging technique for field accessed bubble devices, named \"REFLECTION COIL PACKAGING\", is proposed. The \"REFLECTION COIL PACKAGING\", comprising flat coils and a conductor plate with attached bubble chips, is characterized by ease of assembly, good thermal properties and low induced noise; it also has a potential capability for high-speed (up to 1 MHz) operations. Described in this paper are the concept of the \"REFLECTION COIL PACKAGING\", its basic characteristics and experimental results on the prototype high-speed module."
"Restriction of electron mean free path in small metallic particles leads to a modification of the bulk optical and magneto-optic constants. The effect of this restriction and particle shape on the effective macroscopic values of\\bar{n}and\\bar{Q}for a particulate layer are considered. Values of saturation polar Kerr rotation and Faraday effect figure of merit are calculated for different volume concentrations of nickel particles in a quartz matrix."
"Generation and fast switching of rf-rotating fields for bubble memories becomes much easier, if only one rf-switching transistor is used outside the parallel resonant circuit formed by the field coil and a capacitor. In this case pulses to the basis of that transistor are not only used to start and stop the rotation, but also to feed back the energy lost by the circuit damping. The energy to build up the field and to maintain its amplitude is delivered to the coil system by a DC source only and is returned to that, when rotation stops. A versatile field generator is described, which is able to produce fields adjustable in amplitude and frequency up to 40 A/cm and 1 MHz within a coil volume of 36 cm3."
"Reversible magnetooptic memories are believed to compete favorably with magnetic bubble devices and CCD's if economic low-power light sources can be used. For optical information storage at data rates of >106bit/s and blocks of 103bit, memory materials are required exhibiting an optical recording sensitivity on the order of the photographic plate. The presented contribution outlines the recently proposed concept of a magnetooptic/photoconductive sandwich, called MOPS, and shows that certain ferrimagnetic garnet compositions can especially be adapted to such applications."
"We propose a new model for the interpretation of pulsed field gradient propagation of bubbles, based on recent high-speed photography measurements in Eu-Ga-YIG films. We propose that dynamic conversion, i.e. Bloch curve nucleation and expansion, occurs consistently in our films during propagation, giving rise to motion at a saturation velocity of order 1000 cm/sec; large net displacements are achieved by a ballistic overshoot arising from the Bloch curve winding. Scatter and negative deviations of the net displacements from the theory occur because of incomplete unwinding of the Bloch curves."
"Large magneto-optic effects are associated with the crystal field transitions of Co++(Td) in a variety of spinel oxides. In the oxides, the F and P crystal field bands peak at about 1.5 and 0.6 μm, respectively. Many iron-containing quaternary compounds (CoTxFe2-xO4) have transition temperatures above ambient. Here, T is a trivalent metal ion such as Cr3+or Rh3+. Room-temperature magneto-optic measurements on a number of these compounds indicate peak Faraday effects in the range of 0.5 × 105to 1.0 × 105(deg/cm) at about 0.6 μm. The Curie temperature may be adjusted by the compositional parameter x and normal remanence of the surface Kerr effects are observed. The latter properties are potentially useful for optical memory devices. These materials are considered for isolation and modulation devices in the 5.0 to 12.0 μm wavelength range."
"A model for thermomagnetic writing in Gd-Co sputtered films at its compensation temperature is described. In the vicinity of the compensation temperature, the films have rectangular hysteresis loops with large values of coercive force. Spots are thermomagnetically written and erased by using a He-Ne laser in conjunction with an external magnetic field, and a diameter approximately of1.5 \\sim 2 \\mum is achieved. Photographs of spots written thermomagnetically are shown. The written domains are circular and clear in shape, and are stable. Temperature dependences of coercive force in Gd-Co sputtered films, and characters of spot diameter as a function of applied magnetic field and writing laser power are reported."
"The growth conditions and magnetooptical properties of films of Bi-substituted iron garnets are described. The chemical composition of TmBiFe-Ga garnet films grown from a PbO,B2O3flux has been determined using the radiotracer technique of chemical analysis. The maximum value of the figure of merit (Faraday rotation per unit optical attenuation) found for these films is 2.5 deg/dB at 560 nm. Annealing experiments show that the lead incorporated in these films does not appreciably influence the optical absorption. Using a flux of Bi2O3,MeO2(with Me = Si,Ce), Bi-substituted iron garnet films have been grown. For (TmBiFeGa) garnet films a value of the figure of merit of 3.5 deg/dB at 560 nm is obtained. The Faraday rotation and the optical absorption are measured in the visible for (YBiFeGa)8O12films grown on a large lattice constant substrate. The figure of merit at 560 nm was found to be 4.7 deg/dB."
"Several ferrimagnetic garnet compositions have been studied in view of their use in integrated optics. Films of (Sc,Ga):YIG, (Gd,Ga):YIG, (Pr,Ga):YbIG and (Pr,Bi,Ga):YbIG have been grown by liquid phase epitaxy on <111> GdGaG and fully characterized by classical and guided waves experiments at 1.152 and 1.064μm wavelengthes."
"Both the monochromatic and white light performance of a magneto-optic display, using bismuth substituted iron garnets are discussed. It is shown that for monochromatic light, efficiencies up to 28% and contrast ratios up to 180:1 can be achieved. For a practical device, using a white light source, efficiencies up to 8% with contrast ratios in excess of 20:1 can be achieved. It is also shown that a projection display, with a screen illuminance of 0.08 lumens/cm2(∼ 280FL) can be made, using a x20 projection lens and a quartz halogen lamp."
"The Faraday or Kerr rotation of the plane of polarization of light incident on adjacent magnetic domains has opposite sense. Thus light transmitted through a film containing stripe domains or reflected from it is diffracted, as by a grating. The period of such a grating can be controlled by the application of a uniform magnetic field. We report on experimental and theoretical work that explores the range of grating field control under quasistatic conditions, using real films, specifically"
"Optical and magnetic properties of orthoferrite platelets with the optical axis normal to the surface have been investigated. A simple calculation has been performed indicating that a considerable increase of optical contrast between domains magnetized in opposite directions can be expected in such platelets when compared to the contrast obtainable in platelets with the crystalline \"c\" axis perpendicular to the surface. A numerical calculation has also beem performed for the stability range of a skew-bubble occuring in an orthoferrite platelet in which the magnetization is not perpendicular to the surface. It was found that this range is smaller and shifted to the lower bias fields than that for a normal bubble, amd that the ellipticity of a skew-bubble is larger. Experiments confirmed the theoretical prediction. On the basis of experimental results it was concluded that the shape of the skew-bubble wall is rather complex in thin platelet. This hypothesis has been confirmed to a certain degree by experiments performed on platelets with different thicknesses."
"A discussion of the growth of garnet films by liquid phase epitaxy without rotation of the substrate is presented for magnetic garnet layers used as materials for bubble [(YSm)3(FeGa)5O12; (YLa)3(FeGa)5O12] and magneto-optical memories [(GdBi)3(FeGaAl)5O12]. The background of the experimental and compositional approach is given."
"Pulsed laser illumination has been used to record photographically the instantaneous shapes of hard and soft bubbles during translation. The bubbles were translated between a single pair of stripe conductors carrying parallel currents and were thus subjected simultaneously to translational and radial forces. Noncircular deformations of 2-, 3-and 4-fold symmetry were observed at intermediate and high bubble velocities in hard and soft bubbles. Bubble motion was observed to continue after the termination of the driving pulse, and in directions different from those during the pulse."
"One of the most important problems for a self-biasing bubble (SBB) device is the temperature stability of the SBB diameter. The temperature dependence of the SBB diamater was calculated on the basis of the force stability condition of the SBB and proved to be proportional to the temperature dependence of the characteristic length of the top layer. The proportional coefficient depended on h/l and that was more than -2.7. The smallest value of temperature sensitivity was +0.8%/°C in the system of (YCaEuYb)3GeIG/ (EuEr)3GaIG. No hard bubbles were observed in this self-biasing double layer film and the mobilities of the SBB were similar to those of the usual single layers. And SBB were generated, propagated and detected by means of the usual drive technique (T-Bar permalloy circuits) without any bias field, the operating margins were similar to those of the bubbles in the usual single layer films."
"The effects of doses in implanted magnetic garnets are investigated by means of magnetic modifications of the implanted layer. Experiments performed on materials with various magnetostriction coefficients and with different growth induced anisotropies show that the stresses are proportional to the ion dose. At high dosage levels an elastic-plastic transformation occurs followed by a progressive destruction of the magnetic order. These results make possible the calculation of the dose necessary for a garnet, given its magnetostriction coefficient and its anisotropy energy."
"Hard bubble suppression with proton and neon implantation was achieved in one micron Eu.8Tm2.2Ga.5Fe4.5O12films. The dose and energy required in these one micron bubble films are similar to that required in five micron bubble films, despite the fact that the one micron films have larger uniaxial anisotropy to be overcome with the induced magnetostriction. In addition, controlled state generation (for bubble lattlce device applications) has been demonstrated in the proton implanted samples using two different techniques. The first technique, using a combination of an in-plane field and a critical velocity, is identical to what Hsu has reported with five micron bubbles, except that the in-plane field required in this case is 20 to 40% larger. The second technique, using DC and AC in-plane fields only without any field gradient, has also been shown. In the case of conversion from a bubble that propagates at an angle from the field gradient to one that propagates along the field gradient, a DC in-plane field of 300 Oe is needed. While in the reverse case, an AC in-plane field of 100 Oe or so is necessary."
"The stability of a periodic array of parallel stripe domains in LPE garnet films is investigate both theoretically and experimentally. The vehicle used is the confined region of the bubble lattice device [1] which allows the initialization of straight parallel stripes as well as allowing a variation in the period of the stripe domains. The domains are analyzed wlth respect to the stable number of straight parallel stripes for a given bias field and to their stability with respect to sinusoidal distortions (buckling). The results show that a stable range of bias exists between the upper limit of stripe contraction and the lower limit of stripe buckling."
"This paper reports on design and experimental studies, currently being conducted in Canada, of an electrodynamically-levitated passenger vehicle system. Using a flat-topped guideway, the vehicle is levitated by superconducting magnets interacting with aluminum strips. It is propelled by an inverter-driven, track-powered linear synchronous motor. Control, guidance and damping systems are discussed. Propulsion concepts have been tested in full scale on a wheel test facility."
"The spectral amplitude damping of Barkhausen noise is determined theoretically and experimentally as a function of distance inside the sample itself. Power spectra for noise amplitude and its time derivative are measured in some steel specimens over a wide frequency range. Some examples of the influence of the sample microstructure on the power spectra are also examined. The results, including spectral damping, suggest that the nature of Barkhausen noise changes continuously from nonrandom to random either with the thickness of the sample (0.1-5 mm) or with increasing magnetizing frequency (10-2-102Hz). This phenomenon as a whole is explained in terms of the clustering of elementary magnetization transitions."
 "A review is given of the magnetic and magnetoelastic behavior of both classical and novel materials having Invar characteristics. Contrary to earlier views many materials having such properties exist which contain no iron and have a fairly homogeneous magnetization. Since these materials may be prepared with different Curie temperatures depending on the alloying content, in principle it is possible to tailor-make Invars with any desired properties. The results of the various experimental investigations on these substances, both classical and novel, are described. They are shown to be reasonably consistent with the view that they are weak itinerant ferromagnets. This view allows the consistent application of the Landau-Ginzburg theory in which all coefficients are given explicitly in terms of energy band and itinerant electron interaction parameters. A very brief review is also given of the application of Invar and related substances to a variety of devices."
"A numerical method for the calculation of a stationary two-dimensional magnetic field in a permanent magnet electrical machine at no-load is presented. The field approach based on Maxwell's equations is used to formulate the vector potential equation with variable tensor coefficients which holds for any point in the machine cross section perpendicular to the shaft axis. The partial differential equation is transformed into a finite-difference numerical algorithm. The set of nonlinear partial-difference equations is solved by the iterative line successive overrelaxation procedure. The method presented here is an extension of the Colorado method of Erdélyi and his associates for finding two-dimensional magnetic fields in electrical machines with electromagnetic excitation."
"The levitation force and thrust in a current-controlled single-sided linear induction motor which propels electrodynamically-levitated vehicles are discussed. It has been shown theoretically that the single-sided linear induction motor (SLIM) can operate satisfactorily over suitably large clearance gap compared with the effective height of electrodynamic suspension. The levitation force in SLIM can be used practically as an alternative levitation force in the low-speed region by supplying a primary current several times the rated current within the very short acceleration times. In high-speed Maglev vehicle system with electrodynamic suspension and SLIM propulsion, the aluminum plate for levitation can be saved for the distance to accelerate the vehicle to speeds sufficient for electrodynamic levitation by the cryogenic magnets."
"The studies of the characteristics of superconducting magnetic suspension and guidance systems for high speed trains on loop tracks will be reported, comparing the theoretical results with experimental results obtained by rotating test devices and running test vehicles driven by linear motors."
"The gadolinium garnet system {GdzY3-2x-zCa2x} [Fe2-yIny] (Fe3-xVx)O12was investigated as a function of x, y, and z for0 \\leq x \\leq 0.6, 0 \\leq y \\leq 1.0, and0 \\leq z \\leq 2.4. The relationships between their compositions and magnetic properties were clarified. It was shown that some combinations of components in this system displayed improvements with respect to temperature stability (\\alpha = 0.05%/°C-20 \\sim 60 \\degC) and ferromagnetic resonance linewidth (ΔH = 20 ∼ 30 Oe) as compared with conventional garnets."
"The dynamic domain configurations of bubbles in garnet materials have been studied using a sampling optical microscope capable of single exposure photographs with a 10 nsec exposure time. The microscope is an integral part of a sampling system so that the transient shape of the bubble is recorded at various times after a field pulse or, for bubbles in field access devices, during a clock cycle. A triggerable flowing nitrogen gas laser pumping a low Q Rodamine 6G Dye laser is used as an illumination source giving light pulses of ∼1.5 KW for 10 nsec. This light is sufficient to expose Kodak 4 × 16 mm movie film. Standard pulse generators (HP 214A) are used to make free bubble radial velocity measurements. A modified generator allows free bubble collapse measurement to be made. For bubbles propagating at operating frequency within field access devices, a standard bubble exerciser is used, synchronized to the sampling system. In this case, special samples with an internal mirror and epi-mode illumination are used. Illustrative results of bubble domain shapes in a chevron propagating structure and a 90° chevron expander detector are included."
"A 10-kbit bubble memory chip has been designed and fabricated. Testing was accomplished using a new diagnostic test system, which can drive the bubble chip at two different speeds with bias fields switched synchronously with the bubble propagation. Bias margins of the fabricated chips were analyzed and it was confirmed that a sufficient bias-margin window could be assured in long-term operation."
"Simple formulae have been derived to show the geometrical constraints which determine the resolution of magnetoresistive heads. In the unshielded head the film height is the critical factor which introduces losses which typically reduce the resolution to the order of half the resolution of a conventional inductive head. A shielded MR head has a resolution equivalent to a conventional head having a gap length of between\\frac{1}{2}and\\frac{2}{3}of the shield to shield spacing."
"It is demonstrated that red blood cells may be separated from other blood components using a high gradient magnetic separator. The (SI) magnetic susceptibility of red blood cells is estimated to be 3.88×10-6when the haemoglobin is in the completely deoxygenated state. The magnetic separation effects have been studied using a filter of circular stainless steel wire with flow rates between 10-4ms-1and 6×10-4ms-1and magnetic fields in the range 0.6 to 2.4 T. The results indicate that the filter quickly saturates and the variation of filter performance with field and flowrate is discussed in terms of the force balance and the particle trajectory model. Scanning electron microscopy and free haemoglobin tests on the filtered red blood cells show no evidence of serious damage or cell rupture."
"The experimental performance of a high gradient magnetic separator has been previously reported by other workers in some detail for a CuO/Al2O3slurry. Less detailed results were also reported for slurries of Mn2O3, Al, and α-Fe2O3particles with Al2O3representing a 20:1 range in particle sizes and a 200:1 range in magnetic susceptibility. Examination of these results indicates that many layers of particles build up on each filter fiber. Accordingly, in this paper we extend the original particle trajectory model for the calculation of filter performance, to include the build-up of multiple layers of particles on the fibers. Good agreement is obtained between the calculated recoveries and purities for all of the particles and the experimentally reported values using a filter packing efficiency and a mechanical trapping term, derived from the CuO data, as adjustable parameters."
"Inside a chamber in the TIP-II satellite a \"proof mass\" consisting of a small aluminum cylinder is suspended electromagnetically, and is free to move in the flight path direction (X), but constrained in the transverse motion. The X position of the proof mass is detected optically, and a plasma jet thruster is fired to make the satellite follow the proof mass. Since the proof mass is shielded from aerodynamic drag and solar radiation pressure it responds to gravity forces only, therefore it should be in a \"drag-free\" trajectory, and so also, the satellite. Thus drag is automatically compensated and more accurate prediction of satellite location is possible. The proof mass is a hollow cylinder of aluminum, and is suspended by eddy-current repulsion. A current at 2.08 kHz square wave is applied to a center rod which threads the proof mass, to provide the suspension. The theory of this type of suspension has been developed and measurements have confirmed the theory quite well. For TIP-II the maximum suspension force is on the order of 10-7g's, a very small force relative to the proof mass weight on earth, but sufficient to suspend it in orbit. This system is being manufactured and will be put in orbit in late 1975."
"The spatial frequency response of reproduce heads with infinite depth, but finite pole length, is determined to very good accuracy by superposition of conformal map solutions for simpler geometries. This approach yields closed form approximations of the frequency response which are accurate to better than 7% for any head length-to-gap length ratio and any spatial frequency. In particular, the effect of this ratio on the location of the first gap null in the frequency response spectrum is explored for narrow pole length heads. The results lead to design considerations for extending the useful frequency range of thin film reproduce heads."
"Amorphous alloys with nominal composition of Ni40Fe40P14B6are shown to respond to annealing in a magnetic field. Coercive forces are reduced by a factor of 10 to 50 during annealing of straight ribbons to values of 0.003 Oe, as low as ever reported for potentially useful materials. Concurrently the ratio of the magnetization in 1 Oe applied field, to saturation, increases from about 0.5 to 0.95. These changes during annealing correlate with measured stress relief changes. It thus appears that most of the strain-magnetostriction contribution to the anisotropy is removed during annealing. Magnetic annealing at temperatures as low as 100°C results in noticeable changes in properties. From measurements transverse to the magneticaliy induced anisotropy axis, the induced anisotropy is calculated to be about 800 ergs/cm3, considerably smaller than obtained in crystalline Ni50Fe50. This field-induced anisotropy is reversible in direction and magnitude by reheating the sample to its Curie temperature and then cooling in a field. Annealing of 1.5 cm diameter toroids, made from 50 μm thick tapes, increases the initial permeability by more than a factor of 10 and decreases losses by more than a factor of 10. Losses and permeabilities after heat treatment compare favorably to the Permalloys with similar saturation magnetizations."

"Optical and electron microscopic techniques were used to characterize surface morphologies of (110) [OOI] oriented 3% Si-Fe sheets, and to relate these observations to measurements of core loss. Smooth surfaces were found to produce significantly lower losses than rough surfaces. Smooth surfaces were obtained by annealing with an A1203 separator or by chemical polishing. Rough surfaces were produced by annealing with an MgO separator, annealing for a time too short to reduce the surface oxides, annealing in oxidizing atmospheres, and by chemical etching."

"The rotational and the alternating hysteresis losses have been measured on small discs of 4% silicon-iron with the {110} surface, and the results have been explained on the basis of the changes in domain-structure observed under various conditions. It has been clarified that the magnetization under the rotating field or the alternating field in the <110> direction proceeds by forming finely divided 90° domain-structure and that the greater part of the hysteresis loss under such conditions can be attributed to the energy dissipation due to the annihilation of domain walls. The thickness dependence of the hysteresis losses has been explained from the changes in domain-wall spacing."
"A LiNbO3acoustooptic Bragg deflector utilizing a Ti-diffused optical waveguide and acoustic surface waves, which requires only 50 mW of electrical drive power to obtain 70-percent deflection, has been demonstrated."
"The mode-conversion behavior of branching or separating planar-dielectric waveguides is studied theoretically as a function of branch asymmetry and taper slope. When the taper slope is large in a near-symmetric structure, considerable mode conversion will occur and the structure will act as a power divider. In an asymmetric structure with small taper slope, mode conversion is negligible and the structure will act as a mode splitter. A quantitative formula is presented which can be used to determine the behavior of a given separating structure."
"In a previous letter we proposed a compression scheme which reduces the intensity of a laser pulse in an Nd:glass amplifier chain and thereby allows more efficient energy extraction. In this scheme the nonlinear index of refraction (n2) of the glass in the amplifier impresses a frequency sweep or \"chirp\" on the pulse. Further analysis is presented here. The stability to amplitude noise is demonstrated. We calculate that impressed periodic amplitude modulation is responsible for the growth of distinct spectral sidebands in the nonlinear host glass, and we find that the compressor converts these sidebands into temporal features which precede and follow the central compressed pulse. When a pulse with 10-percent peak-to-peak impressed periodic modulation passes through a sufficient length of glass so that the peak nonlinear phase is approximately 4π, these precursors are only about 1/20th the intensity of the main compressed pulse. RMS equivalent random noise has a flat sideband spectrum, and the precursors are found to be absent in the compressed pulses. The intensity averaging over possible transverse-mode structures is studied for some axially symmetric spatial mode shapes. This averaging somewhat reduces the compression ratio from the estimates in which the transverse modes were flat-topped. Finally, arguments are presented to explain why it is felt that a grating pair is not likely to be a suitable compressor for such intense nanosecond-duration pulses."
"Feedback control is employed to stabilize the output of aQ-switched ruby laser. A computational model of the rate equations plus feedback terms is used to examine pulse shapes with changing feedback parameters. It is shown that a lengthened flat-top pulse cannot be obtained with negative feedback alone, a compound feedback arrangement is suggested to facilitate this. A practical laser system is constructed with an associated feedback loop, good agreement is found between theory and experiment. Pulses flat to within ±5 percent are obtained with durations up to 600 ns and are amplified with no apparent saturation. Output powers of 15 MW are achieved for hundreds of nanoseconds with a divergence of 7 mrad and a spectrum consisting of transform-limited lines separated by the axial mode spacing."
"An AM mode-locked laser with a frequency doubler internal to the laser cavity is analyzed. Mathematical expressions are derived for laser pulsewidth, saturated gain, and second-harmonic output power. It is shown that the maximum second-harmonic power output available from the mode-locked laser is a factor of\\sqrt{2}less than that available from an identical free-running laser. Numerical examples are given for an Nd:YAG laser with a Ba2NaNb5O15internal frequency doubler."
"The bond-orbital model (BOM) for tetrahedral compounds is used self-consistently to calculate the second-order susceptibility. No adjustable parameters are used and agreement with experiment is good. The origin of the nonlinearity arises from a charge transfer as a result of the asymmetric polar energy between the anion and the cation. The model correctly predicts an optimum polarity to maximize second-order susceptibilities."
"The recovery times for transient bleaching of theQ-switch dye bis(4-dimethylaminodithiobenzil)nickel (BDN) in the solvents dichlorethane and iodoethane have been determined. The lengths of pulses from an Nd:glass laser mode locked with BDN have also been measured by means of the two-photon fluorescence technique."
"Radiation-pressure separation of molecules in a closed cylindrical geometry with radiation propagating along the axis has been analyzed. The degree of separation and separation efficiency are compared in the microwave, infrared, and visible-UV spectral regions for representative species."
"Pulsed-laser action is described on a number of atomic transitions of ArI, one of which has not been reported previously. The addition of SF6to Ar shifts the laser action in the Ar from the3d'(3/2)\\min{1}\\max{0} - 4p'(1/2)_{1}transition to six ArI transitions originating from the three lowest states of the3p^{5}3delectron configuration. Significant enhancement of the intensity is observed over that resulting from a discharge in pure argon. In addition, when a small amount of SF6is added to a He discharge, laser oscillation results from FI at 0.7129 μm. Increased SF6pressure produces an unidentified oscillation at 2.639 μm. These last two transitions have been observed also in He-NF3, He-CF4, and He-PF3mixtures."
"We report \"superradiant\" near-IR dye laser emission, with peak of emission in the 690-930-nm range, from nitrogen-laser (\\lambda = 337-nm)-pumped dye solutions including aluminum phthalocyanine chloride and seven polymethine cyanine dyes."
"The \"Fluctuation Model\" for the generation of ultrashort pulses by a saturable absorber has been discussed by a number of authors. This model has provided valuable insights into the mechanisms involved in passive mode locking; however, previous treatments have been incorrect in several important respects. These treatments have attempted to describe the behavior of the laser in terms of the evolution of a statistically independent set of fluctuations (pulses) circulating in the laser. It is shown here that such a description is impossible in principle. This paper discusses in detail the problem with the previous treatments and presents an alternate treatment of the evolution of the ultrashort pulses during the nonlinear phase of development. The model is capable of predicting the conditions under which good mode locking will occur, the probability of the appearance of secondary pulses and their relative intensities, the peak intensity of the output pulse train and its statistical variation, and the duration and time of appearance of the output pulse train. The analysis has also been formulated in such a way that the evolution of the signal can be followed by measurement of experimentally observable quantities."
"Using picopulses generated by a mode-locked ruby laser, we have measured the 3-8-Å bandwidth of a hole burned in the 0-0 transition of cryptocyanine in methanol and demonstrated the inhomogeneous chatacter of this transition. The population-rate equations are written for an inhomogeneous transition with two and four energy levels interacting with continuous or pulsed excitation. Using the numerical solutions of this model together with the experimental result we determine a transverse relaxation timeT_{2} = 0.6-1ps for cryptocyanine in methanol."

"A far infrared (FIR) frequency synthesis technique using saturated-absorption stabilized CO2lasers and a point-contact diode has been used to measure frequencies of a number of strong CW H2O, D2O, and CH3OH laser lines. The first frequency measurements of the 79-μm H2O, the 73- and 108-μm D2O, and 11 CO2-pumped CW12CH216OH laser lines are reported. This measurement is the first demonstration of the general usefulness of CO2lasers for accurate synthesis of FIR frequencies."
"The time-resolved spectrum from a transverse-discharge hydrogen fluoride (HF) laser using a mixture of SF6and HI is reported. Because this spectrum matches that from a high-pressure H2- F2laser, and because the SF2-HI mixture is chemically stable, this laser should be a suitable and convenient source for probing H2- F2amplifiers."
"Three new visible laser transitions at\\lambda = 7120Å in Ba I and at\\lambda = 6496.9and 6141.7 Å in Ba II have been observed in a pulsed discharge with Xe, Ne, and He as carrier gas. A new all-metal hollow-cathode design was used."
"Room temperature CW oscillation of a lithium neodymium tetraphosphate (LiNdP4O12) (LNP) laser with thresholds in the fractional milliwatt range is reported. With a 5145-Å pump, observed threshold was 200 μW and the slope efficiency was 43 percent."
"The performance and spectroscopy of UV ion lasers have been investigated to 1850 Å, the limit of available mirrors. New anomalously strong transitions of about 1-kW peak power were found in Xe IV? at 2315.357 Å and Kr IV at 2191.916 Å. The shortest wavelength new laser transition was Kr IV at 1949.623 Å. Wavelengths were measured for 25 new and many previously known UV laser transitions to about 0.006 Å. Optimum output in watts was also measured as a function of bore current density and gas pressure. All measurements were taken from a 7-mm-bore 150-cm-arc-length tube designed for low electrical inductance providing current excitation pulses with 250-ns full width at half maximum (FWHM)."
"Investigations of the hydrogen vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser carried out in the Institute of Spectroscopy of the USSR Academy of Sciences are reviewed. Data for VUV TEA H2and D2lasers at gas pressure up to 2 atm and for low-pressure high-repetition rate hydrogen lasers axe presented. The upper limit quantum system efficiency for both gas dischaxge ande-beam excitation of H2lasers is discussed. The possibility of obtaining CW operation of the H2-VUV laser is also discussed."
"The emission from the transition I*(52P_{1/2}) \\rightarrowI(52P_{3/2}) at 1.315 μm following injection of HI into a microwave-discharged He/O2flow has been studied. Relative I*(52P_{1/2}) emission intensities have been recorded as a function of HI and O2flow rates and as a function of time after injection. Pulsed gain measurements using an iodine photodissociation laser as a source show that the ratio,N_{I}*/ (N_{I} +N_{I}*,) \\approx 0.15-0.25, is less than that required for population inversion. This observation will be discussed in terms of known chemical processes involving O(3P), HI, O2(1Δg), and iodine atoms."

"We have measured for the first time the chemical composition of the HCN-laser discharge plasma. The results show the important role of hydrogen in the HCN laser.

"We compute coupling coefficients for TE modes as a function of tooth height, active layer thickness, and Bragg scattering order in single-heterostructure (SH) and double-hetetostructute (DH) distributed feedback (DFB) diode lasers for a variety of corrugation shapes. In particular, equations for rectangular, sinusoidal, and triangular shapes are evaluated; the last both in the symmetric and saw-tooth cases. It is shown that the coupling coefficient for rectangular and sawtooth gratings decreases much less rapidly with increasing Bragg order than do the sinusoidal and symmetric triangular."

"The relaxation of low-lying excited states of Tm3+ions doped in YAG, YAlO3, and Y2O3due to photon and phonon emission is studied theoretically. Stimulated emission cross sections (integrated over frequency), fluorescence lifetimes, and radiative quantum efficiencies are calculated and their implications for laser operation on the 2.3-μm3F4→3H5line of Tm3+are discussed. The calculations, based on a few phenomenological parameters which have been determined by others, are easily generalizable to other host materials and other rare-earth (RE) ions. Room-temperature pulsed laser emission from Tm3+ions near 2.3 μm was observed on one line in Tm:Cr:YAG, and on four lines in Tm:Cr:YAlO3. Lower oscillation thresholds were generally obtained in the YAlO3 rods, consistent with the theory presented. A threshold of 31 J was obtained with a Tm:Cr:YAlO3rod at 2.274 μm. In the free-running pulsed mode, peak power levels up to several hundred watts and total output energies up to 12 mJ/pulse were observed. Other general, observed operating characteristics are discussed."
"The 3371-Å nitrogen laser power produced by a relativistic electron beam propagating into nitrogen gas is calculated. The excitation contribution of cascade electrons is found to be negligible, compared to the excitation caused by plasma electrons drifting in the inductive electric field produced by the beam. The extensive experimental data on nitrogen are used wherever possible in the calculation, and the sensitivity of the calculation to the various input data is given. The mechanism of excitation by plasma electrons alone yields agreement within experimental uncertainty for such parameters as the peak laser power, the laser pulsewidth and delay, and the dependence of the laser power on gas pressure. For a larger drift tube radius, the plasma electron mechanism predicts higher power and a different pressure dependence, in agreement with experimental trends. In calculating the laser power, the beam propagation details, excitation to the upper and lower laser levels, collisional quenching, a threshold for amplified spontaneous emission, and excitation and deexcitation by plasma electrons are included, but coherent dipole moment effects are neglected."
"Transversely pumped dye-laser systems are investigated theoretically and experimentally. A set of coupled rate equations for the excited-state population densities and for the photon fluxes in both directions, at all wavelengths, is presented. Both the temporal and spatial dependence of these quantities are accounted for. The equations are solved numerically for a variety of practical situations, and analytical approximations for some limiting cases are discussed. The results describe the dependence of the amplified-spontaneous-emission (ASE) output flux on pumping rate, the spectral narrowing process, and the effects of gain saturation. It is found that under practical laboratory conditions the gain of such dye systems saturates rapidly. Consequently, at high pumping rates the output varies linearly with pump intensity, and the conversion efficiency from pump to ASE photons approaches unity. The performance of dyedaser amplifiers is described by the same set of equations, and the gain characteristics of such systems are analyzed as a function of input signal intensity and pumping rate. The theoretical calculations are compared with the results of a set of experiments, and good agreement is found. The operation characteristics of a dye-laser amplifier are evaluated and utilized in the design of a narrow-band oscillator-amplifier system."
"A frequency-domain analysis of the mode-locked intracavity frequency-doubled laser is pursued. An expression for pulse-width is derived based upon basic laser parameters and the nonlinear coupling of the frequency doubler. It is found that mode locking induces an additional loss to the cavity even in the ideal case, so that the frequency-doubled output power at optimum coupling is less than an optimally coupled fundamental frequency laser with identical losses."
"The effect of the air space on self-focusing instability growth rates has been considered for glass laser systems. The situation may be viewed as a min-max problem in which the air space may be adjusted to minimize the fastest growing instability. A solution exists to the min-max problem which reduces the problem to the solution of a single transcendental equation. Solutions to this equation indicate that, at most, a 10-percent reduction in the effective value of the non-linear index of refraction can occur."

"A newly developed systematic procedure to calculate the real and imaginary parts of the change in propagation constant of a surface-wave mode on a curved open waveguide of general cross section is used here to determine these quantifies for the TE modes of an asymmetric slab waveguide and for all the modes of an optical fiber. Comparison of these results with the existing literature points up the care which must be taken in making approximations in this problem, since errors of significant factors in the radiation loss have been made in previous work."
"A dual-polarization CO2laser can be caused to operate such that the two polarization modes correspond, respectively, to different rotational-vibrational lines. Interline competition effects, similar to those described previously, here also result in a mode power change with optical frequency which can be utilized as a convenient and sensitive optical frequency discriminant."

"HCl pulsed chemical lasing was obtained from several premixed R-Cl/HI mixtures when initiated by a transverse pulsed discharge. The relative merits of these mixtures were compared to a premixed H2/Cl2mixture. For a constant stored electrical energy several mixtures have been found which give higher specific power than the H2/Cl2system. In addition, it has been possible to run some of these improved mixtures without diluent with no laser performance degradation."

"Efficient parametric oscillation in a deuterated rubidium dihydrogen arsenate (RD*A) crystal has been achieved by pumping with the third harmonic of a Nd: YAG laser. A peak power as high as 1.2 MW at 7095 Å and peak powers in excess of 0.5 MW from 6470 to 7850 Å have been obtained."
"An explanation of the excellentQ-switched lasing of Nd:YVO4at pump levels many times threshold with no intracavity polarizer is presented. A small wedge between the laser rod's end faces, coupled with the material's high birefringence, enables the rod to act as its own intraeavity polarizer. This results in a simplification of theQ-switched optical resonator and can be applied to other birefringent laser materials."
"An inexpensive pulsed xenon ion laser with peak power outputs up to 4 kW has been constructed and used as a pump source for a tunable rhodamine 6G dye laser with a 0.25-Å bandpass in the yellow-red range of the spectrum.

"A discussion is given of the limiting spectral efficiency of flashlamps that are used to pump lasers. Absolute measurements indicate that 4.5 percent of the capacitor-bank energy appears as radiant energy in the region 2500-2900 Å (the nominal pump band of the iodine photodissociation laser) for the flashlamps studied in this work. A large portion of the radiation in this band is due to bound-bound processes and not solely recombination radiation and bremsstrahlung as is usually assumed."

"Oppositely directed running waves in a ring laser saturate themselves and one another by population depletion. In addition, as the Doppler broadening decreases, they saturate one another by scattering off induced Bragg gratings in the medium, i.e., off spatial holes burned into the population difference. This increased coupling results in bistable operation near the atomic line center for Doppler-broadened media and for any equal tuning for stationary atoms."
"The results of measurements on a GaAs-double-heterostructure (DHS) laser used as an optical amplifier are reported.

The gain, noise, and performance of the amplifier when driven hard into saturation were measured as a function of various parameters."

"We report a comprehensive study of the operation of a laser using the organic scintillator dye POPOP in the vapor phase. Laser operating parameters have been determined, and we describe tuning experiments which demonstrate an oscillation range of 25 nm. Gain measurements as a function of wavelength and time are reported for transverse pumping with the 337.1-nm output of a pulsed N2laser. The quantum efficiency has been measured as a function of temperature and pump wavelength, and a preliminary study has been made of the effect of buffer gases on the quantum efficiency and the gain. Spectral condensation measurements show 90 percent of the broad-band laser output can be obtained in a 1-nm band-indicating that even in a dilute vapor, the thermalization time of the laser levels is\\gg1ns. We conclude by discussing the implications of these results for the achievement of an electrically pumped dye vapor laser."
"Direct measurements of optical gain using a probe laser beam for the laser dye cresyl violet perchlorate (CVP) in methanol solution using longitudinal pumping at two different wavelengths are described. An analysis of these longitudinal pumping experiments is developed and analytical expressions relating measured gain to the measured pump laser transmission are presented. This analysis is developed in terms of relevant optical cross sections including the influence of excited state absorption. The results demonstrate the influence of excited state absorption at the pump wavelength on pumping efficiency and on the gain per pass at the probe laser wavelength."

"The mechanism of a new method of obtaining high-power single-frequency pulses from a TEA-CO2laser is discussed. Measurements of the shape and monochromaticity of pulses from the hybrid laser which has both a TEA and a low-pressure gain section inside one resonator are presented. The mechanism of single-frequency operation of the hybrid laser is discussed with reference to numerical solutions of simplified rate equations. The low-pressure section provides gain only over a narrow range of frequencies so that a mode lying in that bandwidth builds up faster than neighboring modes to give a single-frequency pulse resembling in overall shape the normal TEA laser pulse. If the system is already lasing when the TEA discharge begins, the single-mode radiation already present rapidly grows to give a single-frequency pulse lacking a gain-switched peak."
"Theoretically predicted mode-dependent modulation in (Ga,Al)P waveguide modulators for which the depletion region is small compared to the guide width is demonstrated experimentally. At 10 V the measured retardations of the three lowest order modes are 0.36, 0.78, and 1.13 rad, respectively."

"Sixteen new IR laser dyes are reported. All lased successfully under excitation from a simple linear flashlamp of about 700-ns rise time. Untuned lasing wavelengths ranged from 810 to 972 nm. Laser output pulse energies from the four best of these dyes were 5-15 times greater than from diethylthiatricarbocyanine iodide (DTTC), with peak output of about 50 mJ obtained from 128-J excitation. Solvent effects with four selected laser dyes are also discussed."

"A doubly clad optical fiber which is composed of the core, inner cladding, and outer cladding is called aW-type fiber when the core has the largest index of refraction of the three and the inner cladding has the lowest. AW-type fiber is known to have several advantages over a conventional singly clad (SC) fiber. This paper presents simple, closed form approximations of aW-type fiber with respect to cutoff, the attenuation constant in the leaky wave region and a rapid change of the group velocity near cutoff, etc. In the approach to be described, aW-type fiber is thought of as a combined system of an SC fiber and an outer perturbing medium."
"It is pointed out that, in order to obtain as large a population as possible in the upper state by laser pumping, the product of laser intensity and saturation parameter determines whether one gains or loses by reflecting the laser beam back into the saturated sample. Switching the polarization of the linearly polarized return beam by 90° eliminates this problem and is always advantageous."
"A simple new mode-selective mirror configuration is realized for obtaining single-mode operation of a six-mode He/Ne laser. Stable single-mode operation could be maintained without active stabilization methods over periods of more than 5 min."
"The effect of external reflectors on longitudinal modes of distributed feedback (DFB) lasers is analyzed. The general case of dissimilar reflectors arbitrarily located relative to the phase of the DFB structure is considered. An eigenvalue equation for the propagation constants is derived and solved numerically for a variety of practical cases. Longitudinal mode thresholds, wavelengths, separations, and field distributions are obtained for GaAs lasers and for DFB lasers with a single reflector. It is shown that these quantities are very sensitive not only to the relative strength of the discrete and DFB, but also to the relative phases. Quite asymmetric transmitted powers are shown to occur under a variety of circumstances."
"The results of a detailed study of electrooptic waveguide grating modulators are presented. Using low-loss epitaxial ZnO on sapphire waveguides with deposited interdigital electrodes diffraction percentages up to 80 percent at 80 V with rise times below 3 ns are observed. Capacitive power requirements on the order of 4 mW/MHz are predicted. A theoretical description which includes carrier and piezoelectric effects is given and is shown to be adequate for designing this type of modulator. The grating waveguide modulator spatially separates the diffracted from the main beam and thus can be used for switching. In addition, the spatial separation allows a number of these to be cascaded on a common waveguide. These features make it probable that grating modulators will find a variety of uses in integrated optics."
"This paper presents calculations of the third-order susceptibility in the alkali metal vapors involving spin-orbit coupling in the energy spectrum of the alkali atoms and some power transfer between the atoms in the ensemble and their surroundings, including the radiation field.

"We consider scattering of light out of the guiding layer into the substrate and the airspace of an asymmetric slab waveguide caused by periodic refractive-index fluctuations. Also discussed is the effect of backscattering of a guided wave into itself. The periodic index fluctuations may be caused by an acoustic surface wave. For this reason, we assume that the intensity of the index fluctuations decreases exponentially with increasing depth below the surface of the guide. However, out discussion is general, and the acoustic surface wave is used only as an example. Numerical results and graphic examples are given."
"An upper limit on the duration of X-ray pulses emitted by a laser-produced plasma has been obtained using a picosecond optical-sampling system. When irradiating an iron target with 1-J 40-ps pulses from a Nd:glass laser, X-ray pulses were as short as 50 ps with a 0.5- percent conversion efficiency. The technique utilized direct excitation of a plastic scintillator and measurement of the scintillation light rise time. Time resolution was ≤50 ps."
"A simple, reliable copper vapor laser is described with vapor produced by discharge heating. Average output power of 1.3 W has resulted at 6.8 kHz and a specific energy of 39 μJ/cm3. Copper vapor density as high as3 \\times 10^{16}cm-3was achieved."
"Photopreionization of the 3371-Å pulsed N2laser by use of a seed gas of low ionization threshold and flashlamp excitation is observed to result in increased laser output and reproducibility. Preionization also increases the range of permissible operating pressures, enabling operation with atmospheric-pressure mixtures of N2and He without reduced intensity."
"The near fields of GaAs double-heterostructure (DH) laser mirrors are studied both in photoluminescent (PL) excitation and in lasing emission. The various liquid-phase-epitaxial (LPE) layers of the laser diode are optically delineated, with\\mp0.1-\\mum resolution, in a wavelength-selective PL detection system. The near fields of the transverse lasing modes are correlated with the LPE layers that constitute the optical waveguide. With special emphasis on the large-cavity fundamental-mode Ppn'N laser, it is found that small changes in refractive index within the waveguide have pronounced effects on the distribution of stimulated power within the LPE layers. The fundamental mode is found to be contained within the slightly higher refractive-index gain region. This explains the previously observed localization of catastrophic mirror damage and the anomalously large angles of beam divergence. High-order modes are also excited in the gain region when its thickness and refractive-index step within the waveguide exceed some prescribed limits."
"A single magnetic- and current-tuned PbSe diode laser was used to measure completely resolved spectra of SO2at low pressures over a major portion (1176.0-1265.8 cm-1) of theRbranch of the ν1band for the first time. It is shown that the combination of magnetic and current tuning allows complete coverage of this 89.8-cm-1wide spectral region. Results generally show excellent agreement with theoretically generated spectra. Magnetic-tuning rates and, with magnetic field applied, current-tuning rates were observed to be significantly nonlinear. Precise spectroscopic data could be obtained with these nonlinearities taken into account. The current-tuning rate in zero magnetic field was essentially constant over the range investigated."
"The present paper deals with the interaction of a Gaussian mode with a homogeneous and an inhomogeneous laser transition. The interaction of the beam with the medium in a laser is treated by taking into account the spatial distribution of both radiation and gain. The intensity characteristics are very different from those obtained for a one-dimensional interaction of a plane wave with a saturating medium. In the presence of a small-signal gain profile the threshold condition requires much higher inversion densities along the optic axis than by ignoring this profile. For gas lasers, for instance, having a small-signal gain profile that is approximately described by a zero-order Bessel function, the threshold inversion density can be about 50 percent higher. For high-power systems the saturation of the medium by the Gaussian intensity distribution results in a considerable amount of radial radiation transport. For homogeneous transitions this amount is about equal to the stimulated emission and for inhomogeneous transitions it is about half of it, independent of the beamwidth. Further, it is found that if one slowly passes the threshold condition for laser action, the intensity jumps from zero to a certain value and vice versa. This effect has also been verified experimentally."
"The widely used technique for determining optical gain and absorption from single-pass, amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) is analyzed with particular attention given to active-volume saturation and three-dimensional effects. The results for homogeneously broadened media show that the population inversion and hence the gain in the active region is diminished by high levels of spontaneous and ASE. The externally measured gain is further reduced for large output collection apertures that admit incompletely amplified off-axis rays. Criteria are given for the excitation and detection geometries required to ensure accurate (∼10-percent) gain measurement. The simultaneous measurement of the equilibrium absorption coefficient can be made under less restrictive conditions."
"A passively mode-locked Nd:YAG oscillator operating in TEM00mode is investigated theoretically and experimentally. It is shown that a mode-locking threshold well above the normal lasing threshold exists and that this second threshold is of a probabilistic nature. This means that mode locking at a given pump rate in the region of threshold occurs only with a certain probability due to the Gaussian statistics of spontaneous emission. Experiments agree qualitatively with theory. Furthermore, thermal effects in the liquid absorber are shown to play an important role in mode-locking systems; they introduce an additional time-dependent loss or gain, depending on the experimental setup. This can either lead to increase of mode-locking threshold or to the appearance of higher order transverse modes and possible damage of laser components."
"An electronic feedback circuit is described which has been used in a Nd:glass high-power laser system for converting the spiky light emission into a smooth near-rectangular output of adjustable intensity and duration. The feedback circuit is also capable of converting the laser emission into a stroboscopic output of frequency of several hundreds of kilohertz or into aQ-switched high-intensity output. The attractive feature of the system is that the change from one type of laser operation into the other does not require any modification to the circuit, but only a simple readjustment of a few control knobs. The feedback system incorporates a high-current fast photodiode, a Pockels-cell shutter, and a pulser. The main innovation of the present electronic feedback circuit over previously proposed systems is the ability to set the Pockels cell at any point of its transmission curve. This feature will be demonstrated to be of decisive importance in smoothing out the laser emission and in converting the spiky light output into a series of periodic light pulses."
"An iodine photodissociation laser has been operated at three atmospheres by adding an inert gas to the laser medium. With three atmospheres of helium added a stimulated-emission cross section of2 \\times 10^{-19}cm2and an inversion half-life of 110 μs was observed."
"Spatial hole burning at the position of the dye cell is identified to be responsible for stable double-, triple-, and higher oligo-mode action in a narrow-band CW dye laser. This may be exploited systematically to control the mode distances by arranging the positions of both resonator end mirrors. A total output power up to over 100 mW is obtainable for double- or triple-mode action. Special conditions are described to obtain stable double-mode action with 1772-MHz mode spacing, as needed for simultaneous optical pumping of the two sodium hyperfine ground states."

"When guiding is due to a continuously varying, rather than discontinuous, index of refraction,n(z), andn(z)peaks at some point inside the propagation medium, there may result \"buried modes,\" i.e., modes whose exponential decay takes place inside the guiding medium rather than, as is usual, in an adjacent medium. The conditions for obtaining these modes are discussed in the Wentzel-Kramer-Brillouin (WKB) approximation and the mode equations given for both these modes and the usual ones for an illustrative case."
"Measurements of the noise fluctuations present in the output intensity from stripe-geometry double-heterostructure junction lasers operating continuously at room temperature are reported. In some but not all the lasers studied, the low-frequency (50-MHz) fluctuations exhibit the quieting expected of an amplitude-stabilized oscillator operating above threshold. The intensity noise in these lasers becomes shot noise limited at currents about 10 percent above threshold, even when many longitudinal modes are oscillating. Additional measurements demonstrate explicitly the effective elimination of the wave-interaction, or excess, noise during the transit of the threshold region. However, in other lasers which are nominally similar, only a partial reduction of the excess noise occurs above threshold, resulting in a noise level which can be more than ten times the shot-noise limit. In addition, we find in all lasers studied thus far no quieting at high frequencies (4 GHz), in apparent contradiction to the behavior expected of a well-stabilized oscillator."
"The reaction of N atoms with CS2has been studied and a mechanism for the reaction proposed. It has been demonstrated that the N + NS reaction produces vibrationally excited N2. Evidence has been presented which indicates that the rate of the N + CS2reaction is substantially slower than first indicated. The analogous reaction N + OCS → NS + CO has also been studied and a mechanism proposed."
"An optical diffraction phenomenon in an ion-exchanged planar optical waveguide with a sputter-etched periodic surface corrugation was experimentally investigated in detail. A single-mode incident beam simultaneously gave rise to several diffracted beams of different mode indices in different directions. This phenomenon was interpreted on the basis of the phase-matching diagram for the multimode Bragg diffraction by using measured wave vectors of the propagation modes and of the surface corrugation."
"A new laser oscillation has been observed in a pulsed discharge of He and SnCl4. This oscillation at 1.061 μm corresponds to the5sSp^{3} ^{3}D\\min{1}\\max{o} \\rightarrow 5s^{2}5p6p ^{3}P_{2}transition in Sn(I)."
"We measured the energy extraction for 60-ns pulses and compared our experimental and theoretical results. The theoretical curve is in agreement with the experimental results. We plotted the theoretical evolution of\\alpha, N_{001}/N_{A}, N_{100}/N_{A}, andTin an amplifying stage. We finally compared the different energy extraction versus the pulse duration."
"We report the demonstration of high-resolution 10.6-μm radar-range resolution using a broad-band FM-chirp signal, but requiring only narrow-band performance in a heterodyne detector."
"The CS2/O2/N2O flame laser has been operated for the first time under conditions in which the spectral output is nearly single line. This transition is theP_{10-9}(17) of CO at 5.4265 μm, the same transition which was observed to oscillate in single-line fashion by Hirose et al. in an electrically initiated CO chemical laser. It is suggested that the unique behavior of this line may be due to its close proximity to aPbranch transition in an adjacent band, namely theP_{9-8}(23) line, such that the gain profiles of the two lines overlap. Calculations suggest that at the conditions of these experiments, the separation of the line centers for this pair is about 0.3 Å or less. TheP_{10-9}(17) transition was also found to be totally absent under certain conditions of high multiline power, particulary at low O2and N2O flows. This may be due to absorption by a high-bandRbranch transition at 5.4266 μm, namely theR_{15-16}(32) line."
"Resonance self-absorption from overlapping lines is an important pressure-dependent mechanism for theoretical analysis of a high-pressure CO laser. Although the effect on total optical output efficiency, kinetic heating rate, and transient time scales is small, predicted output spectral distributions can change significantly. Results of calculations will be presented which show that output power is redistributed to higher vibrational bands with more uniqueP(J)characteristics. Previous analytical work on CO laser kinetics produced distributions that lay one or two υ bands lower than what is observed, and was incapable of explaining anomalous spectra which often show certain transitions missing. Qualitative comparisons with experiment indicate that these effects occur at much lower pressures than theoretically predicted by this analysis. This suggests that further work will be required to correctly describe the mechanism of optical broadening in a CO laser medium."
"A method is presented for numerical calculation of the phase constants of the modes of diffused optical waveguides of arbitrary index profile. For a given bulk and surface index, the phase constants can be plotted against diffusion depth. Graphs giving the number of modes supported by a guide with a particular diffusion depth and index change can also be calculated. Examples are given for complementary error function, Gaussian, and exponential profiles, with indices representative of metal-diffused LiNbO3guides. It is also shown that, by making certain approximations, the modes of a diffused waveguide may be described by just two quantities, a normalized diffusion depth and a normalized mode index. A single universal chart of these two quantities can be made for any diffusion shape, and all diffused guides with this diffusion shape are described by this chart. Charts are given for complementary error function, Gaussian, and exponential shapes. Careful measurement of effective mode indices of Ni-diffused LiNbO3guides fit the universal chart for a complementary error-function shape. A second type of universal chart for each shape relates the number of modes to the diffusion depth and indices of refraction."
"Using time-resolved interferometry, we have compared the nonlinear wavefront distortion induced by the simultaneous propagation of an intense light beam in pertinent sample materials relative to the known reference material. Utilizing several normalization techniques, these measurements have led to precise values for the nonlinear coefficient n2good to 10 percent."
"Analysis of photon-echo behavior using single-mode excitation is given. It is shown that in the presence of extreme inhomogeneous broadening, the excitation with long pulses may display a complicated echo shape. Two typical cases are treated, one in which the pulses have equal length, and the other in which the pulses have equal electric-field strength. These show a large difference in echo behavior, especially for large excitation pulse areas."
"Both small-scale and large-scale partial self-focusing produce phase distortions which result in loss of optical quality of the beam. Both effects are herein studied and both can result in significant power loss. Incipient fine-scale self-focusing losses can be mitigated by spatial filtering. Nonlinear lensing, i.e., partial large-scale self-focusing, is more or less serious depending on the size of the target onto which the beam is to be focused."
"It has generally been supposed that the rise and fall times of the gain in pulsed CO2laser discharges reflect the effective lifetimes of the lower and upper laser levels. Consequently, the ratio of the upper to lower level populationsN_{u}/N_{l}should change during the evolution of the gain, and should be a relatively large number at the gain peak. The problems associated with the determination of this ratio using conventional direct gain measurements are discussed, and a new in-cavity technique is described that has sufficient precision to determine the ratioN_{u}/N_{l}as a function of time. The results obtained unambiguously demonstrate that the lower laser level empties rapidly during the rise time of the gain. This conclusion is further reinforced by some measurements concerning the time variation of the gain in the hot band (01^{1}1 \\rightarrow 11^{1}0)."
"Several scaling generalizations for a high-pressure CO electric-discharge laser (EDL) are presented and compared with experimental data from a pulsed e--beam-stabilized device. It is shown that the transient evolution of the CO laser medium is mainly dependent only upon the total energy deposition per CO molecule as a function of time. Results of theoretical calculations for CO/Ar mixtures are presented which show that, for temperatures 100-300 K, laser threshold occurs afterE/p_{CO} \\sim 0.5 - 1.0J/1/torr (CO) has been deposited, and that steady state is attained afterE/p_{CO} \\sim 1.7 - 2.6J/1/torr (CO) has been deposited, Experimental results for a variety of CO/Ar and CO/N2mixtures confirm these predictions for a range of excitation rates. These generalizations make it possible to predict the temporal power characteristics of a large class of both pulsed and flowing CW CO lasers without resort to extensive computer calculations. Characterization of the gain saturation as a function of total radiation intensity was also investigated. Results indicate that, after attainment of steady state, the CO EDL saturates with threshold level like a simple two-level system, with a scaled saturation intensity ofI_{sat}\\xi/p_CO^{2} \\sim 0.6 = 6.4W/cm2/torr2(CO) over the range of temperatures from 60 to 300 K (\\xiis the fraction of CO self-broadening to total broadening)."
"A four-level rate-equation model for an optically pumped far-infrared (FIR) laser is presented, and an expression is derived for the output power as a function of pump power and gas pressure. The theory is compared with measurements on the 570.5-μm line of CH3OH, pumped by a CO2laser. The width of the gain curve is measured and is shown to go below the Doppler width of the laser transition at low pressure. This indicates that the use of a monochromatic pump source leads to a velocity selective pumping process."
"Laser action at 1.0845 μm is demonstrated in a neodymium-doped LiNbO3crystal pumped by 0.7525-μm krypton laser, which happens to coincide with a Nd absorption line. Although LiNbO3is a good laser host, with good electrooptic and acoustooptic properties, laser damage limits its applicability at present unless one is willing to maintain the crystal at 165°C."
 "A theoretical analysis of third-order nonlinear interactions of focused laser beams is performed for the processes\\omega_{1} + \\omega_{2} + \\omega_{3} \\rightarrow \\omega_{4}, \\omega_{1} + \\omega_{2} - \\omega_{3} \\rightarrow \\omega_{4}, and\\omega_{1} - \\omega_{2} - \\omega_{3} \\rightarrow \\omega_{4}. The total power and far-field beam profile of the generated radiation is related to the total powers of the fundamental beams, to the tightness and location of the focus, and to the value of the difference between the wave vectors of the generated radiation and driving polarization. The optimum degree of wave-vector mismatch as a function of tightness and location of focus is determined for each of the three processes. The process\\omega_{1} + \\omega_{2} - \\omega_{3} \\rightarrow \\omega_{4}is found to be unique in that it is always optimized by focusing as tightly as possible. Experimental results, which verify the theory for the processes\\omega_{1} + \\omega_{2} + \\omega_{3} \\rightarrow \\omega_{4}and\\omega_{1} + \\omega_{2} - \\omega_{3} \\rightarrow \\omega_{4}, are presented."

"Bulk photoconductivity produced by the absorption of picosecond optical pulses in silicon transmission-line structures has been used to switch and gate microwave signals. The technique permits the generation of microwave and millimeter-wave pulses as short as a single cycle, and requires only a few microjoules of optical energy. The basic features of the device are illustrated with switching experiments at 1 GHz and 10 GHz, and the results are discussed with reference to the physical properties of the high-density plasma responsible for the switching."

For the increasing number of specialists in this field, this issue provides a convenient collection of current papers for future reference. For interested workers in other fields, this volume presents a snapshot view of topics under current investigation by researchers in the field. The issue is sponsored by the 1974 IEEE International Semiconductor Laser Conference, which was held on November 18-20, 1974, in Atlanta, Ga.

"An analytical expression is found for the angular beam divergence from a double-heterojunction (DH) laser in the limit of an infinitely thin active region. In this limit the beam divergence is proportional to the thickness of the active region and to the index of refraction difference between the active and confining layers. A simple expression combining the limiting expressions for thin and thick active regions gives a very accurate fit to the numerical calculations of the beam divergence for intermediate active region thicknesses."
"Suppression of the self-induced intensity pulsations from CW junction lasers has been achieved by operating the laser with frequency-selective optical feedback. The feedback is achieved by optically coupling a diffraction grating to a laser mirror. The feedback suppresses all longitudinal modes except one or two and thereby eliminates the mode interactions necessary for sustained optical pulsing. The experimental results directly support the previously proposed model for self-induced optical pulsing in semiconductor lasers."
"By combining a carrier concentration-dependent loss term with our earlier time-dependent saturable absorption loss term we have produced a comprehensive theory forQswitching which successfully accounts for the results so far reported. The concentration-dependent loss term shows a superlinear dependence with current due to the decrease of real guiding at the p-n junction. This increase in loss, however, reaches a maximum and shows a slight decrease at higher concentrations due to the onset of weak imaginary guiding."
"\"H-shape\" light pulses, i.e., short light pulses superimposed on the beginning and end of a steady laser emission, are observed from pulsed single-heterostructure lasers operated at particular temperatures and currents. At a slightly higher current the steady laser emission is extinguished leaving the two peaks. The effect, observed in single-heterostructure lasers fabricated on low doped n-type substrates, was studied for various driving currents and laser temperatures. A theoretical study involving computations with standard laser parameters has resulted in light-output curves having a similar form. The rate equations computed contained a superlinear carrier-concentration-dependent loss term as well as the term for the emission of spontaneous photons into the laser mode. Loss of optical confinement due to carrier-induced changes in refractive index is proposed as an explanation for the superlinear carrier-dependent loss."
"An external dispersive cavity is used to map out the gain profile of single-heterostructure (SH), double-heterostructure (DH), and large-optical-cavity (LOC) lasers. The variations in gain profile with dopant and device operating conditions are reported. With certain cavity arrangements, long time delays in DH devices are observed; this shows that saturable absorption can be present in these as well as in all other types of GaAs diodes. A model combining saturable absorption with a breakdown in optical guiding makes it possible to consistently interpret all reported time-delay data for GaAs diffused-junction (DJ) and SH diode lasers, includingQ-switching and abnormal-delay effects. Finally, experiments where two gratings are used to oscillate a diode simultaneously at two different, independently variable frequencies are described."
"The intensity fluctuations in the output of CW AlGaAs semiconductor lasers were measured as functions of pumping current and operating time. The magnitude of fluctuation decreases with increasing aging time. The shift after degradation in the resonant-peak frequency for the normalized pumping rate is small. An increase of the half-width of the resonance peak is also observed, together with an increase of the threshold current and a decrease of the external differential quantum efficiency. The fluctuation spectra due to the quantum shot noise were calculated using rate equations with parametric variation of the pumping rate and the internal quantum efficiency. From the qualitative agreement between calculated and experimental results, changes in the intensity fluctuations after degradation are considered to be partly due to a decrease of the internal quantum efficiency or gain."
"The climb networks to be expected in an injection laser through 1) electromigration and 2) thermomigration are considered. It is shown that a model involving electromigration and dislocation pipe diffusion can explain the experimental results [1], [2], [7]. It is predicted that thermomigration may be important in optically pumped devices. It is further shown that elastic strain, per se, cannot be responsible for the degradation. Where numerical reduction is appropriate, parameters of the GaAs-Ga1-xAlxAs system are used. The activation energy for pipe diffusion in GaAs is estimated to be 0.75 eV and the process is believed to be controlled by the diffusion of arsenic vacancies."
"Recent work has shown that the primary cause of rapid degradation in GaAs-(GaAl)As lasers is the propagation of dark-line defects which originate at threading dislocations present in the as-grown material. This paper considers the effect of first-order elastic interactions between dislocations and deliberately added impurities, such as the commonly used dopants and group III or V impurities. Strongly interacting impurities tend to concentrate preferentially around dislocations in positions where they relieve stress, thus forming an impurity cloud. Subsequent movement of the dislocation then becomes energetically unfavorable. For impurities such as In, Sb, and N the pinning forces can be as large as 1010dynes/cm2. It seems likely that this type of dislocation pinning can be used to eliminate or greatly reduce the probability of a threading dislocation initiating a dark-line defect."
"In CO2-N2-He electric-discharge lasers, small concentrations of impurities may be present in the original gases, or new species may be generated by the discharge. In order to determine the effects of such impurities, controlled amounts of possible contaminants were introduced into the amplifier of a CO2probe-amplifier system. Small-signal gain was reduced in all cases when CO, O2, NO, N2O, or NO2molecules were added. It was found that less than 0.1 percent of NO2or N2O markedly reduces the laser gain and alters the discharge impedance. A discharge model which describes a three-component positive-column plasma (electrons, positive ions, and negative ions) yields results consistent with the observations. The influence of attachment and detachment rates on molecular gas discharge characteristics and stability are studied."
"Differential equations are derived for forced mode locking of a homogeneously broadened laser in the frequency domain and time domain. Simple methods are presented for the analysis of pulse shapes for other than sinusoidal modulation. The higher order Hermite-Gaussian solutions of the synchronous sinusoidal modulation are shown to be unstable and hence unrealizable in the steady state."
"In a Kr-laser pumped CW Nd-pentaphosphate (NdP5O14) laser, with a threshold of 1.6 mW, an internal quantum efficiency of 63 percent is measured using a novel method. Bistable operation between oscillating and nonoscillating regimes is observed, resulting from the thermal lens created in the pumped zone. If stimulated emission is initially absent, this lensing effect is strong, making the resonator unstable and stimulated emission cannot build up. With stimulated emission initially present, heat development is reduced by the stimulated process itself and the resonator remains in the stable regime. For both situations, temperatures in the pumped area are determined using Raman spectroscopy. For the nonlasing situation, a fluorescence quenching rate of 68 percent, originating from Nd-Nd interactions is deduced, in close agreement with an earlier finding."
"This paper discusses characteristics of a class of devices that use a saturable absorber irradiated by an optical control pulse, or gating pulse, to alter the shape of a transmitted optical signal. We consider two device geometries: a longitudinally gated cell, in which signal and gate beams are nearly parallel, and a transverse cell, in which the medium is bleached by a gating pulse applied at right angles to the signal beam. The longitudinal device permits synthesis of rising exponential signal pulses with arbitrary, subnanosecond time constants. The transverse geometry can provide pulses of complex shape and permits independent optimization of several device parameters. The dynamics of the saturable absorber (with particular emphasis on liquid dye systems) is analyzed in detail, and a pulse-shape synthesis procedure is outlined. Spurious nonlinear effects are considered, and an example of pulse shaping for laser-driven fusion is given."
"Calculations of threshold current densities for lead-tin telluride double-heterojunction (DH) laser diodes are presented, in which the spatial distribution of the injected minority carriers and the critical level of minority carrier injection necessary for population inversion are considered. Excellent agreement between the predictions of this model and experimental data is obtained, which suggests that credible predictions of high-temperature performance can be made. The need to inject a critical level of minority carriers is shown to be the principal contribution to the threshold current density except at very low temperature and to lead to a rapid increase in threshold with increasing temperature. It is found experimentally that below 40 K the threshold no longer decreases with temperature; two possible explanations for this behavior are suggested."
"The effects of the selective addition of the gases H2, CO, O2, NO, NO2, and N2O on the output peak power and stability of a flowing-gas TEA laser operating with a basic mixture of CO2, N2, and He are examined. These additive gases are possible products of reactions which occur in the discharge region of the laser and have considerable bearing on the operation of a sealed TEA laser. The power output is increased with the limited addition of H2(∼5 percent) or NO (∼0.2 percent), whereas N2O, NO2, O2, and CO reduce the power output when present in any amount; 50-percent reduction being obtained with ∼0.23-percent N2O, ∼0.15-percent NO2, ∼4-percent O2, and ∼22-percent CO. H2(and possible NO) limits the transition from a diffuse glow to are discharge by allowing a larger range of operating conditions, whereas CO reduces the range of operating conditions for stable operation. O2does not affect the discharge, whereas N2O and NO2both encourage the transition to arcing."
"An investigation of the far-infrared (FIR) response of an optically pumped molecular laser to an infrared (IR) pulse source is presented. It is shown that a three-level laser model explains the observed amplitude and delay of FIR output pulses when a reduction factor for participating molecules is included in the model. A discussion of those physical mechanisms that might be responsible for the reduction factor is given along with a description of how the FIR laser's performance depends on various physical parameters."
"GaAs-AlxGa1-xAs double-heterostructure (DH) lasers with Si-doped n-type active layers have been prepared by molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) and the laser properties evaluated. With 0.2-μm-thick active layers and 300-μm cavity lengths, typical room-temperature threshold current densities Jthof5.0 \\times 10^{3}A/cm2and best values of2.5 \\times 10^{3}A/cm2have been obtained. Stripe-geometry devices were run CW up to 9°C. Photoluminescence (PL) studies of single layers grown with the donors Si, Ge, and Sn show that the luminescent intensity for MBE n-type layers depends on the substrate temperature during growth. The PL intensity for Sn-doped MBE layers was greater than for high-quality Sn-doped liquid-phase-epitaxial layers."
"Two methods of operating red CW dye lasers are examined. A single laser with a mixture of rhodamine 6G and cresyl violet perchlorate (CVP) is compared with a tandem system in which a rhodamine 6G laser is used to pump a CVP laser. At high pumping levels the tandem system is shown to be superior."
"A metal ceramic He-Ne laser has been operating on lifetest for over five years (> 47 000 h). During this period there has been no appreciable change in either the output power or the voltage-current characteristics of the unit. These results indicate the possibility of extremely long-life He-Ne lasers."
"The gains and reflectivities of the transverse-electric (TE) modes of GaAs large-cavity double-heterostructure (DH) (P-p-ń-N) lasers havebeen calculated in order to study mode selection perpendicular to the junction plane. The GaAs laser is modeled as a passive dielectric-slab waveguide composed of four layers whose optical constants are taken from recent literature. In lasers having a cavity thickness of a few microns, a small difference in refractive index between the p- and ń-region leads to the fundamental mode being confined to the p-region. Discrimination in favor of this mode without significant penalty in threshold gain may be achieved by utilizing the mode-dependent loss in the ń-layer. It is found that optimum mode discrimination in favor of the fundamental mode is governed by a suitable combination of the p-layer thickness, loss in the ń-region, and the difference of refractive indices of the p- and ń-layers. This analysis contrasts with an earlier analysis of the case of uniform refractive index in which it was found that the p-layer should be twice as thick as the n-layer for optimum mode discrimination. The calculated mode shapes in P-p-ń-N lasers are found to be in qualitative agreement with those observed recently by Hakki, and also with earlier observations that catastrophic mirror damage in P-p-ń-N lasers is confined to the p-region. Contrary to experimental observation, the model predicts that lasers having cavity thicknesses as large as 3 μm should operate stably in the fundamental mode. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are advanced. A simplification of the P-p-ń-N laser, which consists of omitting the N-layer thus yielding an asymmetric double-heterostructure laser, is suggested, and the merits and drawbacks of such a design are discussed."
"Theoretical calculations are presented showing the relationship between the internal laser absorption and structural parameters appropriate for CW room-temperature lasers. These diodes have submicron-thick recombination regions, and very small spacings between the heat sink and the recombination region to minimize the thermal resistance. The optical loss is shown to be strongly dependent on the degree of radiation confinement to the active region. In particular, absorption in the surface GaAs layer providing the ohmic contact becomes very significant when the intermediate (AlGa)As layer is reduced below about 1 μm. It is further shown that excessive penetration into the GaAs regions gives rise to anomalies in the far-field radiation profiles in the direction perpendicular to the junction plane. Proper design of the internal structure of the laser avoids large increases of the threshold current density as well as large decreases in the external differential quantum efficiency from interaction with the contact layer. The design curves presented can be used to predict the gain required at threshold for a broad range of structural parameters of interest in low-threshold laser design."
"Several sources of the dark-line defect (DLD) that causes rapid degradation of GaAs-AlGaAs double-heterostructure (DH) lasers have been identified by means of photoluminescence (PL) topography and a laser-induced degradation technique. All the sources that have been identified correspond to crystal defects, among which dark-spot defects (DSD) that are native to as-grown wafers are found to be most important. The growth and propagation processes of DLD's and DSD's have also been investigated. These defects are found to be highly mobile under high-intensity laser pumping. The correlation between the substrate dislocations and the DSD's has been examined by etching and X-ray topography. Although most DSD's correspond to etch-pits in epilayers, they are not always correlated with substrate dislocations."
"The extraction of stored energy from a CO2-laser amplifier by a short-duration input pulse is described using a rate-equation theory. The influence of rotational and intramode vibrational energy-transfer processes is studied as a function of the energy density Einand width τpof the input pulse. By a suitable choice of normalized variables δ andE_{in}/E_{sat}for the extracted-energy and input-energy density, it is found that the results for different values of τpare interrelated by simple translations in a δ versusE_{in}/E_{sat}diagram. The characteristic curves in this diagram are nearly independent of the amplifier gain factor\\exp (\\alpha_{0}L)for high-gain systems. A comparison of the theory with experimental results of Figueira et al. shows satisfactory agreement and leads to an estimate of (1.0-3.5) 10-6s-1torr-1for the rate of intra-mode vibrational-vibrational (VV) energy transfer in CO2."
"This paper reports the fabrication, testing, and analysis of distributed-feedback (DFB) single-heterostructure (SH) electrically pumped GaAs lasers. The techniques of fabricating the DFB grating and diode using interferometric exposure of photoresist, development, ion milling, liquid-phase-epitaxial growth, and diffusion are described in detail. Next, experimental results on a variety of diodes operating at 77 K are presented. It is shown that narrow laser linewidth (< 0.15 Å) and low threshold operation (775 A/cm2) can be obtained. Also reported is output coupling from the grating which results in highly collimated laser beams with divergence of approximately 0.35°. Coupling coefficients, which determine laser threshold, are computed as a function of device parameters including physical dimensions, refractive indices, grating size and shape, and Bragg order for single-and double-heterostructure geometries. Calculated and measured thresholds are shown to be in good agreement."
"The growth and laser properties of In1-xGaxP1-zAsz/ GaAs1-yPysingle heterojunction laser diodes are described. High-quality p-type In1-xGaxP1-zAszlayers are grown by liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) on n-type VPE GaAs1-yPysubstrates of compositiony = 0.32 - 0.40. Laser operation (77 K) of these quaternary-ternary heterojunctions is demonstrated at shorter wavelengths (<6300 Å) and lower thresholds (J_{th} \\lsim 6.2 \\times 10^{4}A/cm2) than comparable GaAs1-yPyhomojunctions. The increase observed in threshold current (5x) betweeny = 0.38andy = 0.40GaAs1-yPysubstrates is attributed to the usual effect of EXapproachingE_{\\Gamma}near the direct-indirect transition. From the well-defined cavity mode structure observed on these hetero-junctions, data are obtained at relatively high energy on the index dispersion quantity{n - \\lambda(dn/d\\lambda)}, which increases monotonically with photon energy and provides a reference for the distinctly different behavior observed on N-doped GaAs1-yPy(h_{\\nu} \\sim E_{\\Gamma} \\sim E_{N})."
"External quantum efficiency of > 20 percent has been achieved from tunable CW InSb lasers resonantly pumped with a CO laser. Thin InSb platelets at < 10 K were pumped in a longitudinal geometry with the InSb recombination emission paralleI to the CO radiation. Single-longitudinal-mode operation with power up to 10 mW has been achieved with a 0.1-0.3-cm-1linewidth, mechanically or thermally tunable over several cm-1. Magnetic-field effects on the threshold and emission frequency have also been studied."
"Efficient generation of high-power dye-laser radiation in the blue and violet has been achieved by pumping longitudinally with the third harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser. A peak power as high as 2.4 MW at 4890 Å and peak powers in excess of 1.3 MW from 4300 to 5100 Å have been obtained."
"Optical absorption, fluorescence, and laser characteristics of lithium neodymium tetraphosphate (LiNdP4O12, abbreviated as LNP) were examined. The crystal belongs to the monoclinic system (pseudoorthorhombic system) and the Nd content is4.37 \\times 10^{21}cm-3. The lifetime of the4F_{3/2}level is 120 μs, which is one-half of 230μs observed in Nd:YAG. The largest effective emission cross section at the line peak (1.047_{7} \\mum) was spectroscopically determined as3.2 \\times 10^{-19}cm2for the electric vector parallel to the pseudoorthorhombiccaxis and quantum efficiency was estimated as 0.48. Quasi-continuous laser oscillation pumped by a chopped Ar-ion laser was achieved with a 1.85-mm-long crystal. The output light was linearly polarized along the pseudoorthorhombiccaxis of the crystal, which does not depend on the polarization direction of the pump light. The measured threshold and round-trip loss yield the value of3.1 \\times 10^{-19}cm2for the effective emission cross section of LNP, which is in good agreement with the value obtained from the spectroscopic data."
"Single-pass amplifier gains at 1.32 μm have been measured in an 80-mm Nd:YAG rod, achieving a saturated gain of 3.1. Small-signal gain comparisons imply a stimulated-emission cross-section ratio (1.32/1.06 \\mum) of 0.19."
"By using a Schottky-barrier-gate Gunn-effect digital device the direct modulation of a GaAs-AlxGa1-xAs double-heterostructure laser was achieved with a rise time of 250 ps. The dependence of the optical waveforms on the bias-current levels was investigated in detail. The results are compared with a rate-equation analysis. A discrepancy between the present theory and the experiment indicates the existence of an additional relaxation mechanism."
"The experimental investigation of laser-light modulation by injecting laser light of a frequency, which is slightly different from the cavity resonant frequency, into a laser-diode cavity is reported. For this investigation, the interaction of two laser diodes was used and the relation between the oscillation frequency spectra and the lasing frequency difference of the two diodes was measured where the frequency difference was greater than the locking frequency range. The sidebands generated by the injection of laser light were measured to judge an appearance of the injection-induced modulation of light intensity. Modulation in the frequencies from 10 to 90 GHz was achieved by using laser diodes of60-130-\\mum length. It was experimentally shown that the upper frequency limit of the injection-induced modulation was related to theQvalue of the laser-diode cavity."
"The variation in the output pulse duration of a mode-locked internally frequency-doubled (MLFD) laser was experimentally studied. The dependence of pulse duration on second-harmonic conversion rate and modulation index in a Nd:YAG laser is reported. The laser was frequency doubled by a barium sodium niobate crystal located inside the laser cavity and was mode locked by a quartz acousto-optic loss modulator. The observed variation of pulse duration with modulation depth and second-harmonic conversion rate is in good agreement with theory. The techniques reported should allow continuous variation of 1.06-μm pulse duration from about 50 ps to greater than 900 ps to be obtained."
"Anomalous asymmetric interaction of the closely spaced spectral modes of a semiconductor laser is found experimentally in lasers with selective external cavities. The stimulated scattering of the laser radiation by dynamic inhomogeneities of the electron density is considered to be responsible for the anomalous mode interaction."
"The oscillation regime of GaAs injection lasers has been investigated by methods of time-resolved spectroscopy and nonlinear interferometry. The relative roles of random and correlated process were studied. Spectroscopic data and interferometric investigations of laser samples in CW as well as in pulse regimes show that in most cases multimode operation occurs with random phase fluctuations. However, in some cases signs of mode locking of longitudinal modes were observed with ultrashort pulsation. The duration time of the pulsation is estimated to be about 3 ps."
"Preliminary experimental results are reported to demonstrate that fundamental transverse mode operation can be obtained from a multimode double-heterostructure (DH) junction laser while simultaneously coupling its output into a single-mode optical fiber. Mode selection has been achieved by three different methods: 1) incorporating the fiber into the resonant cavity; 2) using the reflections off the diode-fiber interface; and 3) by a combination of the aforementioned methods. In all approaches the diode-fiber interface effectively becomes a mirror with a reflectivity which is higher for the fundamental mode than for all other modes of the DH waveguide. By using the reflections off the diode-fiber interface, a peak pulsed power of 80 mW has been obtained from the uncoated end of a single-mode fiber butted against a P-p-n-N junction laser. This laser radiated a peak power of 165 mW in a first-order mode when operated without coupling to the fiber."
"A new method is presented to measure the temperature of the optical cavity of a junction laser as a function of the average electrical power supplied to the device. The technique relies upon a null measurement of the exact wavelength of a single Fabry-Perot mode and therefore does not require a preliminary calibration measurement. Because of the small linewidth of the mode, very small (<0.2\\degC) temperature differences are easily measured. The method is utilized to obtain the thermal impedance for several different types of bonded stripe-geometry junction lasers."
"The thermal characteristics and CW operation of buried-heterostructure (BH) injection lasers, in which the GaAs active regions are completely buried in Ga1-xAlxAs, are described. The narrow active regions of these diodes facilitate effective heat dissipation. Thus, the CW operation of these lasers has been achieved without the p-GaAs layers usually grown in double-heterostructure (DH) lasers for electrical contacting purposes and with the heat dissipation through n-GaAs substrates. Even in this disadvantageous configuration, the temperature rise in the active regions of BH lasers at threshold is much smaller than that of p-side-down DH lasers. The calculation using an approximate formula can explain these low experimental values fairly well. Due to low operating current and effective heat dissipation, BH lasers can be operated continuously at room temperature on very small heat sinks such as TO-5 transistor headers."
"Measurements of the polarization characteristics of the optical emission from CW AlzGa1-zAs-AlxGa1-xAs double-hetero-structure (DH) junction lasers are reported. Spectral observations demonstrate that in many lasers the lasing emission is not linearly polarized as expected from the conventional electromagnetic (EM) theory of the laser. A small but measurable field component is observed orthogonal to the main emission. In some lasers, the optical field is shown to be elliptically polarized, while in other devices the polarization state is more complex. The observed depolarization of the lasing modes is attributed to a strain-induced anisotropy in the dielectric properties of the laser waveguide. The anisotropic configuration which leads to elliptically polarized light is analyzed in detail and is shown to be equal to a pure shear in a plane parallel to the junction."
"The optical-absorption loss in (GaAl)As/GaAs heterostructure lasers with narrow active layers and passive layers doped below5 \\times 10^{17}cm-3should be less than 5 cm-1. Measurements which have been made on a variety of three- and five-layer lasers have seldom shown such low figures. Optical-scattering loss at imperfections in the heterostructure interface could account for the discrepancy. An analysis of the scattering in both three- and five-layer heterostructures is presented. Curves are derived relating the absorption coefficient with the dielectric-constant step at the Waveguide Wall, the active-layer thickness, and the magnitude of the roughness. Measured losses as high as 12 cm-1can be accounted for by a roughness amplitude of only 0.01 μm."
"Monolithic homojunction diode lasers have been fabricated from vapor-grown Ga1-xInxAs (0 \\leq x \\geq 0.06) mesa structures with grown optical facets. The Ga1-xInxAs lasers have been operated at 77 K, and similar GaAs mesa devices have lased between 77 K and 300 K. Monolithic arrays of up to six mesa lasers on a single substrate have been operated with all lasers oscillating simultaneously."
"An integrated twin-guide (ITG) laser which has an active waveguide for laser oscillation and an external waveguide for the light output is proposed as an integrated-optics laser or as a new semiconductor laser, and its properties are investigated theoretically and experimentally. ITG lasers were constructed in the form of an AlGaAs multiheterostructure, and their preliminary characteristics were obtained with both optical pumping and current injection at room temperature. The end mirrors of the active waveguide were fabricated by a back-sputtering method. The axial mode selectivity was predicted by the analysis and observed experimentally."
"Corrugated AlGaAs waveguide devices have been fabricated which emit low-divergence (\\sim1\\degby 15°) laser beams nearly normal to the waveguide plane when pulsed electrically at room temperature. The devices are fabricated from material which is essentially the same as that used to fabricate CW room-temperature lasers, differing only in that the two top layers of AlGaAs and GaAs are very thin (\\sim0.4 \\mum and 0.1 μm, respectively). Threshold current densities of 3000-4000 A/cm2are typical in these devices even though ∼20 percent of the resonator length is unpumped. The far-field pattern produced by the TE polarized leaky-wave laser beams emanating from the unpumped region is usually composed of two mode lines. A theory is outlined which describes how these mode lines are generated. The possibility of obtaining distributed-feedback (DFB) oscillation in devices of this type is also discussed."
"Liquid-phase-epitaxial growth procedures have been used to form a double-heterostructure (DH) laser in which the radiation is taper coupled from the active layer into a passive waveguide. The taper extends smoothly over distances\\sim100 \\mum and efficiently couples the radiation from the electrically pumped section into a low-loss adjacent waveguide of comparable dimension (0.5 μm). The passive-waveguide dimension beyond the taper coupler is widened to any desired dimension by inserting a cooling fin (or spacer) into the growth melt, permitting control of the laser output divergence without mode conversion. These structures have been made with the following properties: threshold current density 2.6 kA/cm2; differential quantum efficiency 28 percent; taper coupling efficiency ∼90 percent; and half-power radiation field angles of 48 and 29° from the active (0.5 μm thick) and passive (1.5 μm thick) regions, respectively. Using similar growth procedures, devices have been constructed where the laser radiation is taper coupled into passive waveguides permitting both laser mirrors to be formed in passive regions."
"In AlAs-GaAs semiconductor heterojunction lasers, due to the interaction of the waveguide modes with a diffraction grating on the surface of the waveguide layer, output of coherent radiation has been obtained through the plane parallel to the layer. The angle of divergence of the radiation in this case was equal to 0.5° both with optical and injection pumping. The possibility of fabricating a new type of semiconductor laser with small radiation divergence has been proven experimentally."
"GaAs-GaAlAs double-heterostructure distributed-feedback injection lasers are investigated at temperatures between 80 and 150 K under pulsed operation. The optical feedback for laser oscillation is provided by a corrugated interface between the p-GaAs active layer and the p-GaAlAs layer. The corrugation is made by two methods, ion milling and chemical etching, and the latter method is found to give the lower threshold. The laser oscillation occurs in a single longitudinal mode, whose wavelength is stable against the change of the excitation level. The temperature dependence of the wavelength of the distributed-feedback laser is shown to be 0.5 Å/°, which is about\\frac{1}{3}to\\frac{1}{4}that of the conventional Fabry-Perot (FP) laser."
"A \"rib-guide\" optical-waveguide structure proposed as a means of injection-laser transverse-mode control, independent of current distribution, has been demonstrated in an AlGaAs double-hereto-structure (DH) diode laser. The new structure showed stable single-transverse-mode operation at currents to twice threshold with small rib dimensions, and the observed higher order modes in large structures are in reasonable agreement with theory."
"A new semiconductor laser structure named the transverse-junction-stripe (TJS) laser, in which the active region is a GaAs p-n homojunction sandwiched between GaAlAs layers, has been developed. It is possible to operate the laser continuously at room temperature below 100 mA. The minimum threshold current is 34 and 50 mA in pulsed and continuous operation, respectively. Relatively high efficiencies have been obtained, comparable to those of conventional double-heterostructure (DH) lasers. The transverse mode is fundamental in both directions and is almost independent of input current up to three times the threshold current. The longitudinal mode stays nearly single over a wide range of input current. The TE/TM power ratio exceeds 100 at 1.5 times the threshold current."
"Visible-light-emitting lasers were fabricated, using a new stripe-geometry double heterostructure. The distinct feature of the geometry is the isolation of the contact stripe electrode to p-GaAs by the use of a layer of n-Ga1-zAlzAs epitaxially grown on top of p-GaAs. This geometry results in small internal strain, few crystal imperfections, and low thermal resistance in diodes so that high laser performance can be obtained. Lasing wavelengths as short as 7610 Å and 6680 Å have been attained in CW and pulsed operation, respectively, at room temperature. Various characteristic features of the lasers are described with regard to optical spectra, lasing thresholds, and external quantum efficiencies."
"A different type of stripe-geometry laser is demonstrated in which current confinement is achieved by selective diffusion of the n-type substrate prior to growth of the GaAs/GaAlAs heterostructure layers. This structure exhibits low room-temperature threshold currents resulting from the small lateral-current spreading from the edges of the stripe. Lowest order transverse-mode operation is achieved for stripe widths of 10μm."
"We describe a new process for stripe formation in double-heterostructure GaAs/GaAlAs injection lasers. This process, which uses oxygen-ion implantation to form the stripe through a chemical doping effect, has several advantages over alternative methods, both with respect to device processing and device properties and has produced high yields of CW room-temperature lasers. We present the details of the device structure and fabrication processes. The results of annealing studies, optical measurements, and lifetesting are described."
"Procedures for calculating the range of currents and heat-sink temperatures in which continuous-wave (CW) operation is possible and the light-output power levels within this range are presented for double-heterostructure (DH) lasers with an oxide-insulated stripe geometry. A one-dimensional heat-flow model has been assumed within the device followed by two-dimensional heat flow into the heat sink. It is shown that a laser with stripe dimensions (13 μm\\times 400\\mum) and typical thicknesses can achieve CW operation at heat-sink temperatures up to about 431 K. At 300 K, the theoretical power output is in the 40-50-mW range forJ = 2J_{th}. The effects of varying thicknesses and the aluminum content in the GaAlAs confining layer are considered. The limitations of the calculation are discussed as well as its applicability to other stripe-geometry devices."

"The characteristics of a high-energy hydrogen fluoride (HF) laser and the effects of optical elements on beam quality and on energy extraction are described. The HF laser is initiated by injecting a 2-MeV electron beam into a mixture of SF6and C2H6. With 300-torr SF6and 30-torr C2H6, the radiated energy with a flat mirror on one end of the laser cell is ≈80 percent of the two-way energy when no mirrors are used. The effect of a confocal unstable resonator in providing collimation of the laser beam was studied. The maximum laser energy measured was 380 J in a 23-ns full width at half maximum (FWHM) pulse. The maximum electrical efficiency measured was 14 percent, which is about 60 percent of the maximum theoretical value."
"The burning velocity and the nature of the H2/F2flame at various gas compositions gas compositions have been experimentally determined. It was found that reactions induced by a diffusion-type flame proceed rather slowly, but reactions triggered by a compression wave proceed with supersonic speed. Based on the measurements of gas stability, repetetive pulse operation of H2/F2chemical lasers at atmospheric pressure has been achieved. The second and third explosion limits of H2+ F2reactions in O2/He mixtures were also studied experimentally to improve our understanding of the nature of H2+ F2explosion. The apparatus allowed the simultaneous time-resolved measurement of both gas pressure and temperature at the center of the spherical reaction vessel. It was found that, for fixed H2+ F2total pressure and O2concentration, mixtures with higher F2/H2ratios are less stable and explode at a lower temperature. It appears quite certain that molecular O2plays an important role in the chain termination reaction. However, the addition of CF4, SF6, or N2showed no effect on the boundaries of the H2/F2explosion."
"An experimental method, employing a fast population perturbation technique, is described to measure the vibrational-vibrational (VV) collisional probabilityP\\min{r,r-1}\\max{\\upsilon,\\upsilon+1}of a diatomic molecule for large vibrational quantum numbersrand υ. The relaxation of the perturbed gain of a pair of vibrational levels is a function of the vibrational populations andVVrate constantsK\\min{\\upsilon,\\upsilon+1}\\max{r,r,-1}. The numerical inversion of theVVmaster rate equations determining this relaxation does not give unique value forK\\min{r,r-1}\\max{\\upsilon,\\upsilon+1}(orP\\min{r,r-1}\\max{\\upsilon,\\upsilon+1}), but lower bounds can be evaluated and with empirical formulas, having several adjustable constants, it can be shown that probabilities of the order of unity are required to satisfy the experimental data. The method has been specifically applied to the CO molecule, but other molecules such as HX(X = F, C1, Br), NO, etc., could also be measured."
"This Special Issue of the IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics is devoted to papers presented at the 4th Conference on Chemical and Molecular Lasers held in St Louis, MO, USA, 21-23 October 1974. This conference was held in cooperation with the AP/IEEE Joint Council on Quantum Electronics and the IEEE Quantum Electronics Council, and received financial support from the Chemistry Directorate of the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research. The purposes of the Conference were principally to bring together people active in the area and to present new research results. One hundred five papers were presented at the meeting; included in this Journal are 7 full length papers andD igests of the remaining 98 papers."
          "A computer code modeling the CS2/O CW CO chemical laser (CL) is reported. The accuracy of the code has been tested by calculations of small-signal gain, output power, and chemical species densities in devices for which experimental data ate available. Generally, good agreement is obtained. The code was also used to predict gain variations with diluent/fuel ratio, initial temperature, and cavity pressure."
    "A theory of vibration-to-vibration energy transfer is developed for HF/DF(υ = 1) + HF/DF(υ = 1) → HF/DF(υ = 0) + HF/DF(υ = 2) based on the model of dimer formation. This model is shown to be primarily responsible for the energy transfer below 500 K where a strong negative temperature dependence of energy-transfer rates is found; above this temperature the rapid rotational motion of the colliding molecules causes the energy exchange to take place with the result that the rate increases with temperature in a normal fashion. The model represents the low-temperature limit of the energy-transfer process, while the rapid rotational model gives the high-temperature limiting rate, so the overall collision process can be explained in terms of these two contributions. The sum takes a minimum value near 700 K in both HF + HF and DF + DF collisions."
          "Energy-transfer rates for theE \\rightarrow Eprocess Na(2P_{3/2})+ Na (2S_{1/2}) \\rightleftarrowNa (2P_{1/2}) + Na (2S_{1/2}) + \\DeltaE= 17.2 cm-1have been measured following direct excitation of specific2Plevels with a pulsed tunable dye laser of 10-2-Å linewidth and 5-ns duration. The cross sections for the forward and backward reactions at 272°C have been found by Pitre and Krause to be 250 ± 40 and 480 ± 80 Å, respectively."
    "The results of a study intended to characterize the properties of CW 10.6-μm waveguide power amplifiers are reported. The analysis considers both single- and double-pass devices, and includes the effects of gain narrowing and power broadening. Experiments on a 1.65-mm-bore device with an active length of 77 cm have been performed. Gains as high as 17 dB/m have been measured at room temperature."
  "Power extraction and chemiluminescence experiments have been conducted in the large-scale DF-CO2transfer chemical laser (TCL) (IRIS-I and IRIS-II) facility at Bell Aerospace Company (BAC). The modular design of the device allowed testing to be conducted with both a supersonic nozzle bank and also in subsonic flow with sonic injection for the deuterium. Power levels of 15 kW at 10.6 μ were obtained in IRIS-I (subsonic) employing an unstable resonator with a 50-percent output coupling ratio and cavity pressure of 35 torr. For IRIS-II (supersonic) somewhat lower power was obtained. In both systems the fluorine dissociation (α = F/F + 2F2) was less than 0.01. Chemi-luminescent emission from HF and DF was monitored under zero-power conditions along an axis parallel to the laser-mirror axis. From the measured DF-concentration profiles it can be inferred that vibrationally excited DF is being produced throughout the cavity and, accordingly, the production of DF must be attributed largely to the chain reaction."
 "The operation of the first self-contained, recirculating, electrically initiated, pulsed chemical laser is reported. A unique combination of scrubber beds selectively removes ground-state DF(HF) and other deleterious gases from the recirculating gas flow. By providing a small gas replenishment, it is possible to operate the laser for extended periods of time with little loss in power. The processes that degrade the power output in the absence of chemical scrubbing are discussed."
"A theoretical model for TE CO2laser dynamics is presented, incorporating the effects of coupling between the rotational sublevels of the laser vibrational states associated with the 10.4-μm transition. It is shown that proper incorporation of this coupling is extremely important for modeling both the initial gain-switched output peak and the subsequent rate at which the radiation energy decays away. In particular, it is demonstrated that the latter rate is a measure of the rate at which energy is removed from the lower laser level The lower laser level is coupled to the bending mode by several relatively rapid vibrational energy exchange processes. The coupled bending and asymmetric stretching modes then lose energy at a much slower rate, controlled by the conversion of vibrational energy to translational energy. A proper choice of initial laser level populations allows the decay rate of the pulse tail to be controlled by either one of these. A novel experimental technique is described which allows the two ranges of operation to be explored. A comparison between theory and experiment produces excellent agreement, and the results are employed to determine values for the relevant rates."
   "The transient phenomena of relaxation oscillations and \"initial spikes\" in organic dye lasers are studied experimentally and theoretically. Both damped relaxation oscillations and initial spikes are clearly observed in N2laser-pumped dye lasers under appropriate conditions which are furthermore shown to agree with theoretical considerations. Linearized rate equations obtained with small-signal approximation are used to describe the initial-spiking phenomenon; for the more general phenomenon of relaxation oscillations computer solutions of the coupled rate equations are obtained. Comparisons with experimental observations show excellent qualitative agreement. Based on the results of these studies, a general technique using the idea of controlled resonator transients is described for tunable subnanosecond pulse generation from laser-pumped dye lasers in the near UV and the visible region of the spectrum."
                         "Summary form only given. Laser action has recently been observed in the green band systems of XeO and Kr0. We report here our analysis of the reaction kinetics in e-beam pumped xenon - oxygen mixtures."
"After reviewing recent work on multiphoton direct detection and single-photon heterodyne detection, we examine the behavior of a multiphoton absorption heterodyne receiver. Expressions are obtained for the detector response, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and minimum detectable power for a number of cases of interest. Receiver performance is found to depend on the higher order correlation functions of the radiation field and on the local oscillator (LO) irradiance. Although performance similar to that of the single-photon heterodyne receiver can theoretically be achieved, practical problems would appear to make this difficult. A physical interpretation of the process in terms of the absorption of monochromatic and nonmonochromatic photons is given. The double-quantum case is treated in particular detail; the results of a preliminary experiment are presented and suggestions for future experiments are provided."
      "The two major thermooptical influences on a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser by an intracavity Ba2Na(NbO3)5crystal are discussed and theoretically examined. The absorption of λ106- and\\lambda0.53-\\mum power by the crystal is shown to lead to the formulation of a thermally induced lens and diffraction loss due to the aspherical distortion. Equations for each are formulated. The effects of the lens and diffraction loss to the performance of the laser are illustrated. The modification to the laser resonator due to the inclusion of these effects is discussed."
"A tunable, Dicke-switched, infrared heterodyne radiometer (IHR) has been designed, fabricated, tested, and used to observe solar radiation and determine the atmospheric transmissivity in the9- 11-\\mum spectral band. The IHR provides a spectral resolution of6.7 \\times 10^{-3}cm-1, a minimum detectable power level of2.9 \\times 10^{-23}W/Hz, and a temperature resolution of less than 1 K for a source temperature of 1000 K, an IF predetection bandwidth of 100 MHz, and an integration time of 30 s. Detailed design equations and measured IHR performance are presented. The IHR was used to make solar and atmospheric transmission measurements and a vertical path atmospheric attenuation of 2.3 dB has been established under favorable weather conditions. The attenuation of solar radiation due to cloud cover and haze have also been investigated."
  "Flowing gas capillary lasers exhibit high optical gains. However, as a result of the linear axial pressure variation in the tube bore, gain and saturation intensities are not axially uniform. This pressure variation can be reduced by introducing the gas into the tube bore through the walls of a porous capillary tube. Analysis of the gas flow shows that the axial pressure variation in the porous wall tubes is more gradual than for dense wall tubes leading to more uniform gain conditions. The saturation intensity is more uniform not only due to the reduced pressure anisotropy but also, at higher flow rates, because of axially varying particle dwell times in the discharge region."
"The competition between two-photon absorption and second-harmonic generation (SHG) in semiconductors is analyzed; particular attention is given to the linear absorption and change of phase-matching conditions caused by the two-photon induced free carriers. The system of equations is solved numerically in the case of tellurium, and this analysis enables prediction of an improvement of harmonic conversion efficiency when using shorter pulses."
"The effect of the free carriers generated by two-photon absorption in tellurium has been studied by using a CO2and a CO laser. Time and power dependence of the induced absorption has been measured, as well as the variation of the two-photon process with the wavelength of the CO laser. These observations confirm the assumptions of the analysis described in Part I."
 "Additions of a few parts per thousand of oxygen to a CO-He mixture change drastically the laser output power, the axial field in the positive column, and the slope of theE-Icurve of the discharge. The intensity of the spectrum of vibrational transitions of the CO molecule increases when oxygen is added; the increase is especially pronounced for transitions from higher (\\upsilon > 7) levels. The most prominent feature in the visible spectrum is the disappearance of the C2-Swan bands with the addition of oxygen. The populations of CO vibrational levels were derived from the IR spectra; they increase by more than an order of magnitude for\\upsilon > 7. The electron energy distribution was derived from measured E/N and the Boltzmann equation. Oxygen affects the Boltzmann equation (and thus the electron energy-distribution function) through the change in E/N, which is in turn determined by ionization and deionization processes. The fractional power transfer from electrons increases to vibrational levels and decreases to electronic levels."

         "CO laser output spectra between 5 and 5.5μm for the free-burning CS2/O2N2O flame laser were examined. Under certain conditions of high 02 and high N2O flow, the spectra were found to be nearly single line in nature with most of the laser output occurring on the P10-9(17) line at 5.4265μm. This is the same line that was reported to lase in a nearly single-line fashion in an electrically- assisted longitudinal CO chemical laser."

From thisthresholdandatheoreticalrelationshipbetween excitation efficiency andpump wavelength, we predict that a threshold of approximately 8.5 mW should be possible for excitation by an edge-emitting 0.8-wm wavelength LED. Usingthin NdP P samples with reflecting back surfaces for better excitation efficiency should lower this threshold by -60 percent, andgiveminimumoptical-to-optical con- version efficiencies of - 3.5 percent."

                    "The time-domain theory of the mode-locked and frequency-doubled laser by J. Falk depends greatly on the particular Gaussian approximation to the pulse transmitted from the frequency doubler. This correspondence examines an alternative approximation which appears to be a better fit to the actual pulse shape and which gives substantially different results for pulsewidth."
"A general technique for measuring the electric-field vector of the ultrashort pulses from mode-locked laser systems is described. The technique is applied to perhaps the most difficult laser to analyze, the dye mode-locked Nd3+:glass laser whose pulses change rapidly in bandwidth and amplitude, are chirped, and can occur in quite short pulse trains. The results of these measurements indicate a rather rapid change in the phases between modes, and a plot of the phase change as a function of mode frequency has been obtained."
"It is shown that the problem of generating an optical pulse of arbitrary shape and phase may be reduced to the problem of producing an arbitrary spectral filter. This generalizes the short-pulse generation techniques, which are based on the laser breakdown switch, as the active element. We examine the extent to which any desired filter may be realized in practice, and some examples are given."
"An analysis is made of the optimum carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) that can be obtained from a laser communications system using external polarization electrooptic modulation and avalanche diode detection. The analysis is not restricted to low-modulation index but covers the range up to the maximum possible modulation. Alternate definitions of modulation index are given in terms of communication concepts. Finally, some practical uses of the results are discussed."
"A compact sealed pulsed CO2TEA laser with an operational life exceeding 106pulses has been developed. It provides single-mode output pulses of 1.0-MW peak power in 50-ns full width at half maximum (FWHM) and total energy 110 mJ in 2 μs. The output beam emerges from an 8.5-mm-diam aperture with a full-angle divergence of 3.5 mrad, which is less than 1.5 times the diffraction limited value. With a different optical resonator system, the corresponding multi-mode output exceeds 1.4 MW in 80 ns with a total energy of 300-500 mJ delivered in 4 μs and with a beam divergence of about 10 mrad. These output levels, corresponding to 15-25 J/l, are obtained for a pulse repetition frequency of 2 Hz and are maintained after initial conditioning, even in lasers tested to2 \\times 10^{6}pulses. Hitherto, prolonged sealed operation was not possible because the glow discharge degraded into arcs. This has been overcome in the present device by the addition of small quantities of carbon monoxide and hydrogen to the basic CO2-N2-He-laser gas mixture before seal-off."
"In an electrooptic crystal TE and TM modes can be coupled by application of a modulation voltage. Two types of modulators using anisotropic crystals are discussed. In the first type a voltage that is constant along the direction of wave propagation couples a guided mode to a radiation mode of the orthogonal polarization so that the radiation loss of the guided mode can be controlled by the applied voltage. The modulator of the second type uses voltage-controlled coupling between guided TE and TM modes. The computation of the coupling coefficients is outlined and numerical examples are plotted for LiNbO3and LiTaO3crystals."
"A new method is presented for reducing the conversion-limiting effects of crystal anisotropy in critically index-matched second-harmonic generation (SHG). A number of crystals are put in series; adjacent crystals are oriented in such a way that their walkoff effects are opposite one another. The harmonic field and the harmonic power of a compensated two-crystal generator are calculated. Numerically computed curves show the dependence of the SH power on the mismatching of the crystals and on the focusing of a TEM00laser beam. Theoretically predicted results are confirmed by experiment. As a typical result, the conversion efficiency of a compensated ADP generator (2 crystals, 1 cm each, in series) at optimum focusing is about twice the efficiency obtained with a single crystal of the same total length (2 cm, single crystal)."

"A closed-form solution is presented for the pulses of a homogeneously broadened laser mode locked by a saturable absorber of relaxation time much longer than the pulsewidth. With suitable approximations, the pulse shape is a secant hyperbolic. The system is described in terms of the linewidth omegaCof the system, the saturation energies of the saturable absorber and the laser medium, the ratio of saturable-absorber loss to resonator loss, and the ratio of cavity round-trip time and laser-medium relaxation time. The energy and width of the pulse are obtained as functions of these parameters. Graphs are presented for the operating regimes as bounded by the choice of the preceding parameters. The theoretical predictions are compared with second-harmonic-generation (SHG) autocorrelation traces of mode-locked dye-laser pulses."
                       "The small-signal gain of a transverse-discharge UV-preionized CO2laser has been investigated at pressures in the 1-15-atm range. Measurements were carded out on theP(18)andR(16)lines of both the 10.4- and 9.4-μm bands, and data on the pressure dependence of the peak gain and gain rise time are presented. The results demonstrate that small-signal gains in excess of 5-percent cm-1are readily obtained at pressures of ∼ 12 atm and confirm that the relaxation times of the energy levels relevant to laser action scale inversely with pressure. In addition, it is found that the gain of bothRbranches increases more rapidly with pressure than that of thePbranches, while there are indications that the 9.4- and 10.4-μm gain values become comparable at pressures of ∼ 15 atm. The experimental results have been compared with the dependence of gain on pressure predicted by a relatively simple theoretical model. On the basis of this model it is found that the experimentally determined gain rises more rapidly with pressure than one would expect and a number of possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed."

          "Analyses of the extraction efficiency from traveling-wave (ring) resonators indicate that for media with low gain-length product (g_{0}l), the coupling fraction from a properly designed ring resonator must be substantially lower than that employed in equivalent standing-wave (linear) configurations."
 "The attenuation characteristics of a multilayer metal-clad optical guide, which is suitable for a mode filter or electrooptic devices, is investigated by the exact theory and the analytical approximation based on a perturbation technique. By using this approximation the dependences of the ohmic loss on the various waveguide parameters and the condition for the absorption peak of the TM mode are derived in closed form. Some remarks concerning the waveguide material and dimension for the design of the mode filter are also presented. The insertion loss at the abrupt junction between a normal (dielectric-clad) optical guide region and a metal-clad optical guide region is treated. Also the transformation of optical guided modes in the two kinds of tapered structures between the above two regions is examined."

     "The qualitative features of the lowest order mode profile of an unstable resonator can be predicted by a simple technique based on Fresnel zone theory. The number of rings in the pattern and the occurrence of a local minimum or a local maximum on-axis can be predicted by computing the number of Fresnel zones subtended at the observation plane by the cavity aperture uniformly illuminated by a point source at the virtual focus. This technique has been verified by computer calculations of mode profiles both inside and external to the cavity for moderate Fresnel numbers. The results were also confirmed by experimentally measured mode profiles on an unstable cavity He-Xe laser. The predicted cyclic nature of the mode loss with cavity aperture diameter was also confirmed experimentally."
              "Sturm's theorem finds much use in linear passive network synthesis. It forms a concluding part of the test for positive real functions, to determine the existence of any positive roots and their multiplicity. By applying the Sturm's theorem to a polynomial, its multiple roots are placed in evidence. The character and multiplicity of roots. of the polynomial under test is determined by inspection or by a simple test, or, if necessary, by repeated use of Sturm's test itself. While dealing with highorder polynomials, repeated use of Sturm's test is necessary, and a computer desirable, since Sturm's test becomes very complex. For a digital computer, the process should be based on a suitable algorithm capable of handling a general case. In this paper, an attempt has been made to present such an algorithm. A flow chart has been developed for this algorithm, process computerized and program tested on a digital computer."

"The concept of the tree graph of a given connected graph was first introduced and studied by Cummins [2]. Further properties of tree graphs were explored in [1], [6]-[10]. In this correspondence, some additional properties of tree graphs are brought out. A related concept of tree numbers is introduced and explored."
"The sensitivity performance of high-Qquadratic sections is often studied in terms ofQsensitivity. This contribution shows that many classes of realization, including those exhibiting high-Qsensitivity, are not particularly dependent onQsensitivity, insofar as overall sensitivity performance is concerned. A comparative study of gyrator-, generalized immittance converter (GIC-), and biquad-type realizations with correctly designed single-amplifier structures reveals that the nonideal performance, as a function ofRCtolerances and amplifier imperfections, is about the same regardless ofQsensitivity. The paper also classifies realization techniques according to their Schoffier and worstcase sensitivities. The sensitivity of certain well-known single-amplifier structures to amplifier gain bandwidth product is evaluated and minimized."
"An active filter is discussed which uses only resistors and two operational amplifiers represented by their single-pole model, but no external capacitors. The filter has very low sensitivities to all circuit parameters, is tunable over exceptionally wide frequency ranges, and is suitable for high-frequency and medium-Qapplications. The usable frequency range is limited only by the validity of the single-pole model of the amplifiers used. The circuit may be used both as a lowpass and as a bandpass. Extensive room-temperature experimental results are presented."
"An algorithm is described for the Monte Carlo analysis of nonlinear circuits. In the proposed procedure, the number of nonlinear equations which must be solved for every Monte Carlo trial at each time point equals the total numberp + \\muof the toleranced and nonlinear elements. The process is efficient provided thatp + \\muis smaller than the number of equations needed to analyze the circuit using conventional methods, i.e., there are relatively few large-tolerance elements in the circuit. The process is also applicable, in a simplified form, to the transient analysis of linear circuits."
"This paper describes an algorithm for the identification of a minimal feedback vertex set of an arbitrary directed graph. Such a set of vertices has the property that removal of these vertices from the graph eliminates all directed loops. An efficient solution to this identification problem is a familiar unsolved problem of contemporary graph theory. Although pathological examples exist for which excessive computation v2 time may be required, the described algorithm appears to be quite v efficient for large graphs arising in practical applications. The algorithm seems to have great potential in the field of test generation for sequential logic circuits and certain types of simulation algorithms. No attempt is V3 made to impose restrictive conditions on the particular minimum feedback vertex set selected, although such restrictions may at times be desirable. The algorithm has been implemented on an IBM 360/67 and has been successfully applied to practical (logic circuit) problems having in excess of 2500 vertices."
"Multiplace graphs are defined set-theoretically by the extension of binary relations in well-known graphs to multiplace relations. They are shown to give a sparse representation of bipartite graphs. Its usefulness is demonstrated by the planarization of graphs based on a new planarity theorem. Applications are especially in the circuit layout field."
"A class of maximally flat magnitude driving-point immittance functions whose real part on thej\\omegaaxis has on equi-ripple variation is identified, and their application in the design of equalizers is indicated. These functions exhibit a better frequency response over a limited band than other known designs and lend themselves to convenient realization in the form of equal-element ladder networks."
"Conditions are given for low-passRCladder networks that realize a voltage transfer function with minimum resistance and capacitance. In particular, it is shown that to minimize the weighted sum of resistance and capacitance, the open-circuit ladder is either symmetrical or antimetrical depending upon the structure considered. For either structure, the optimum ladder network follows directly from the prescribed voltage transfer function. Results are also given for low-pass ladders double-terminated in equal resistances and terminated in a resistor at the output."
"Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the capacitor loaded transformer with time-varying turns ratio to be a complete step-up 1-port forL^2(-\\infty, \\infty). This is then used to demonstrate the existence of an abundance of time-varying complete step-upn-ports forL^2(-\\infty, \\infty). These results are generalized to establish the existence of complete step-upn-ports forL^2(a, b), - \\infty \\leq a < b \\leq \\infty."
"Methods of compensating for the nonuniform sampling resulting from the frame format of PCM channel banks, when the basic sampling rate (usually 8 kHz) is increased by an even factorN, are considered. This situation arises when it is desired to provide greater than 4-kHz bandwidth channels on a PCM system by the modification of an existing channel bank. For the present 24-channel frame format, the distortion introduced is 41.9 dB below the signal power forN = 2and greater than 30 dB forN = 4. Remedies include time delays at the input (implemented by delaying sampling) and output or special output filtering. The output filter requires a Hilbert transform forN = 2, and has a phase discontinuity forN = 4. This phase discontinuity can be eliminated at the expense of allowing some residual distortion."
"An important class of network optimization problems is one in which the objective function is defined in terms of port immittances. Since many solution procedures employ a gradient evaluation of the objective function, calculations of the partial derivatives of port immittances with respect to the parameters that vary are required. A procedure is presented for evaluating the partial derivatives of port immittances with respect to\\sigmaand\\omega, where\\sigma + j \\omegais the transform frequency variable. Adjoint calculations are central to the method."
"The discrete Hilbert transform (DHT) of a periodic sequence is interpreted as a matrix product\\bar{\\phi} = \\bar{C}\\bar{A}. A new singleequation form of the DHT operation for any number of sample pointsNis shown and is used to establish the unique properties of the coefficient matrix\\bar{C}.\\bar{C}is shown to be highly symmetric in nature, and the determination of the elements of\\bar{C}is shown to require a minimum of computation; i.e., less thanNelements need to be computed for anN \\times N\\bar{C}matrix. For theNeven case, the relatively sparse nature of\\bar{C}is established; i.e., at least half the elements of\\bar{C}are zeros."
"Through a simple congruent transformation, it is shown that the open-circuit voltage gain of a given RC low-pass ladder network can be continuously and exactly adjusted to a desired value within the upper and lower bounds while at the same time keeping the driving point impedance invariant. It is also observed that the network of minimum gain corresponds to minimum total resistance, and the maximum gain realization results in the minimum total capacitance."
"In this correspondence, we comment on the algorithmic method of Smith and Walford for identifying the minimal feedback vertex sets in a digraph, and present other relevant problems and references concerning connectivity in digraphs and graphs."
 "Output noise spectral density and total rms output noise of filters with operational amplifiers can be determined by means of transformation of passive part of the filter under the condition that the noise model of the operational amplifier is known. This problem can be solved through sequential calculation of spot noise factors for cascaded passive and active parts of the transformed filter without feedback. In this paper, this approach is used for comparison and discussion of dynamic range of low-pass op-amp filters with positive and negative feedback."
"A new gradient algorithm for the solution of nonlinear minimax problems has been developed. The algorithm is well suited for automated minimax design of networks and it is very simple to use. It compares favorably with recent minimax and leastpth algorithms. General convergence problems related to minimax design of networks are discussed. Finally, minimax design of equalization networks for reflectiontype microwave amplifiers is carried out by means of the proposed algorithm."
"The effect on linear circuit response of simultaneous changes in a number(m)of components must often be computed. Two efficient methods for predicting this effect are examined. It is shown that the computational cost of predicting the effect of each set is approximatelyG_m, whereG_mis the cost of a Gaussian elimination of anm \\times mmatrix. However, if the sets represent combinations of relatively few individual component changes, then systematic exploration is shown to reduce the computational cost per set to the order of 2."
"Several recent publications have called attention to a substantial number of new digital filter topologies to be added to designers' \"catalogs.\" Because of this growing list of available structures, it is worthwhile to code a general-purpose computer analysis and design program that is not limited to any single filter topology. We derive here the mathematical background required for such a program, as well as some of its various programming considerations. For tutorial purposes, a number of numerically based analysis techniques are unified under a common notation and approach. New results include the application of symbolic analysis techniques to digital filters. Digital filter design optimization with symbolic second-derivative information is also discussed. An optimization example is given."
"The design of a SSB modulator for binary data signals using binary transversal filters is described, which gives a transmitter output IN PU E2sRO^ ORDER -0 spectrum which approximates an optimum spectrum for a high-quality transmission channel. The modulator uses the phase-shift method of SSB generation and the arbitrary phase of the transmitted spectrum is chosen to give an efficient modulator realization which overcomes a major drawback of this method of SSB modulation. Both minimum mean-square error and min-max frequency domain designs are considered and a comparison shows the desirability of the former approximation criterion. An implementation of such a modulator is described."
"Bounds for the RMS value of the limit cycles at the output of a cascade of first-order two-dimensional sections are obtained when fixed-point arithmetic is used."
"For some element values, and/or for some interconnections, linear time-invariant networks become degenerate. A description of an easily programmable algorithm which reduces the equations of any such network is presented. The reduced equations specify a set of linear independent constraints on the inputs, a set of linear independent algebraic constraints on the network variables, and a set of differential equations in the normal form on some of the network variables. In particular, the network variables and the initial conditions that can be chosen arbitrarily are easily read from the reduced equations. One feature of the proposed algorithm is that no change of variable is required; hence the results are readily interpreted."
"A new sufficiency proof for the Nyquist criterion is obtained via the analyticity properties of the log function. The intuition derived therefrom is then used to formulate a generalized stability criterion applicable to feedback systems whose open loop gains are characterized by arbitrary Lipschitz continuous unbiased operators."
"A subgraph \"a hybrid tree\" in a linear graphGwhich has properties of both a tree and a cotree is defined. In the definition, the setEof edges ofGis partitioned into two subsets. The relations between the number of edges of a hybrid tree and the partition ofEare discussed. Furthermore, a hybrid tree graph which is a generalized concept of a tree graph and a cotree graph is defined and its some properties are presented."
"First-order perturbation theory is used to find the shifts in the eigenvalues of the state matrix due to changes in the values of the reactive elements and due to the introduction of losses in electrical networks. A set of simultaneous equations are found to realize the invariance of the eigenvalues and the results can be used to compensate for small perturbations in networks. The results are then applied to lossy reactive networks to compensate for the shifts in the natural frequencies due to the introduction of small losses."
  "The canonical network developed in this paper is an active RC negative feedback arrangement that uses a single op-amp and two capacitors to realize low-pass-notch filter characteristics. The filter parameters are adjustable through resistive trimming. This functional tuning process uses a signal generator, a dB-scale voltmeter and a phase meter. The analytical design procedure takes into account a single-pole amplifier model. The network has low-passive sensitivities and is suitable for moderate-Qapplications (Q \\leq 5). An example is discussed giving the resistor's limits for a\\pm10 percent capacitance tolerance."
"A new kind of circuit analysis program, EL, is presented. Whereas other circuit analysis systems rely on classical, formal, analysis techniques, EL employs heuristic \"inspection\" methods to solve rather complex dc bias circuits. These techniques also give EL the ability to explain any result in terms of its own qualitative reasoning processes. EL's reasoning is based on the concept of a \"local one-step deduction\" augmented by various \"teleological\" principles and by the concept of a \"macro-element.\" Several annotated examples of EL in operation and an explanation of how it works are presented. Also how EL can be extended in several directions, including sinusoidal steady-state analysis is shown. Finally, the possible implications of this work for engineering education and computer-aided design technology are discussed briefly. EL is significant not only as a novel approach to circuit analysis but also as an application of Artificial Intelligence techniques to a new and interesting domain."
"Two methods are described for the determination of the quantization errors in digital filters using magnitude truncation quantization. The first method is very accurate but rather cumbersome for numerical analysis. The second method overcomes this disadvantage and uses a quasi-linearization technique. Results are given that indicate the very good agreement between computations and results of simulations, both for a second-order and for a tenth-order recursive digital filter."
"The usual method of measuring the roundoff noise generated in a digital filter may lead, at least in case of sign-magnitude truncation, to an excessive result due to incomplete cancellation of the useful output signal. A simple method for determining a corresponding corrective term is presented."
"The problem of designing recursive digital filters can be reduced to polynomial approximation on a finite interval. The procedure to demonstrate this equivalence described in a recent paper yielded filters with multiple poles. An alternative method is described which avoids this restriction."
"This paper shows that the concept of pseudo-passivity of Fettweis et al. is a special case of V. M. Popov's concept of hyperstability."
"Design formulas are obtained for the basic stepped impedance distributed low-pass prototype filter which exhibits a maximally flat or equiripple insertion loss response characteristic. Explicit formulas are given for the coefficients of a truncated power series in the bandwidth scaling factor for the characteristic impedances. For the low-sensitivity digital wave filter based upon this prototype, the multiplier values are given. Computer results on the analysis of the prototype filter using the new design equations are cited, showing the vast improvement over the narrow band, lumped element, explicit design formulas."
"A procedure to obtain the topological data necessary for a proper layout of a monolithic integrated circuit in planar technology is presented. The first section gives a short summary of the graph theoretic formulation of the layout problem. The \"extended potential graph\" is defined, of which planarity is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a layout satisfying a number of requirements. The second section extensively describes technological possibilities to planarize this graph. After the planarization of the potential graph, some additional data is needed for diffusions that are no longer represented in the modified potential graph. These data can be supplied by an optimization procedure described in the third section. Finally an example illustrates the contents of this paper and some concluding remarks give the relation of this procedure to existing literature in this field."
"The method of \"self-similar solution of partial differential equations\" is introduced and applied to the distributed RGC network. For linear networks convolution integrals,V(x,t) = V_{\\delta} \\times V_{source}andV(x,t) = V_{\\delta'} \\times I_{source}are obtained whereV_\\deltaandV_\\delta'are, respectively, the responses to the\\deltafunction voltage and current sources found and from the self-similar analysis, andV_sourceandI_{source} \\propto \\partial V_{source}/\\partial xare arbitrary voltage and current sources. For certain sources, these integrals have been performed and the results will be presented. The technique is also successfully applied to nonlinear networks which are useful in modeling various microelectronic circuit components."
"A problem of current interest is that of optimizing decay characteristics of asymptotically stable dynamical systems in terms of certain system parameters. In the recent literature, a necessary condition for optimality has been proposed. It is shown here that the proposed condition has not been adequately established and a characterization is given for situations where the conditions may fail to apply. In a special case, the proposed condition is shown to be valid."
"Graph theoretic techniques provide a convenient tool for the investigation of communication networks. Here a communication network is represented by a nonoriented linear graph, in which the edges represent communication links and the vertices represent cities. A transmitting group is a set of cities which, acting as transmitting stations, can transmit messages to every city in the network. Stated graph theoretically, a transmitting group is a dominating set, i.e., a set of verticesDhaving the property that any vertex not inDis adjacent to at least one vertex inD. The problem of finding disjoint dominating sets in a graph is studied, in particular, the domatic numberd(G)of a graphGis defined as the maximum order of a partition of the vertices ofGinto dominating sets."
"There are two topics covered here. First, asymmetrical locking properties of an injection-locked oscillator (ILO) are dealt with. It is shown that these properties can be partly explained by the asymmetry in the phase response of the oscillator tuned circuit. Second, the Shaw-Stover's locking figure of merit is briefly discussed. A general expression for the said figure is given. It can be used for optimization purposes when maximum locking figure of merit is the main goal of a particular design."
 "Although the adjoint approach to sensitivity computation is generally regarded as the most efficient means for computing sensitivities, its utility appeared to be limited for use in computing sensitivities in certain situations. One of these situations is the computation of the sensitivity of switching circuit delay times to the designable parameters. Here, the concept of an event functional is described and its use in extending the adjoint approach for computing sensitivities of quantities such as delay times shown. It is also shown that the event functional allows the solution of the periodic steady-state problem without resorting to more specialized techniques."
"For poles close to the unit circle and nearz = 1, the usual realizations of recursive or IIR digital filters are highly sensitive to the coefficient quantization and have large roundoff noise. As the sampling rate is increased the poles approachz = 1and the problems become more severe. For these situations several new digital filter structures are presented for which the above errors remain constant and generally insignificant as the sampling rate is increased. Results on sensitivity and the roundoff errors for these new structures are presented and compared with conventional realizations. Some numerical results are also presented showing order of magnitude improvements."
"Coefficient sensitivity and roundoff error with floatingpoint rounding have been investigated for several digital ladder filter structures. It is found that in all the cases studied, the ladder structures first proposed by Fettweis show a much lower coefficient sensitivity. In this paper, a hybrid cascade structure is proposed and synthesized. Its coefficient sensitivity is found to be between a conventional cascade structure and the ladder structures. Roundoff error is also investigated by extensive simulation. The new Fettweis ladder structure is found to exhibit the lowest roundoff error. This result is in agreement with the theoretical study which indicates that digital filters which exhibit reduced attenuation sensitivity tend to have less roundoff error."
"Recently, Langham proposed an original technique for frequency multiplication. His circuit uses two oscillators and a simple digital processor. One of the oscillators serves for measuring the period of the input waveform, the other determines the period of the output waveform. The multiplication factor of this frequency multiplier is equal to the ratio of the frequencies of the two oscillators. This circuit has certain advantages when compared to conventional frequency multipliers: it is capable of multiplying the input frequency by any positive real rational number, and yet it is an open-loop system, inherently stable and capable of tracking even the fastest changes in input frequency. One of its main drawbacks is the direct dependence of the accuracy and stability of its multiplication factor on the tracking characteristics of two independent oscillators. A way of eliminating this drawback is proposed here. It involves discarding one of the reference oscillators at the cost of adding a readonly memory (ROM). The modified system is insensitive to reference frequency variations and its accuracy is determined only by the roundoff errors in the digital processor."
"A new resistive 3-port network configuration capable of realizing any given third-order real symmetric paramount matrix is given. All the edge conductances are explicitly expressed in terms of the entries of the given matrix obviating matrix inversion at any stage of the calculation of the edge conductance values. Also all kinds of degeneracies are taken care of by the explicit formulas given for the edge conductances."
"The frequency weighted least-square design of finiteduration filters, in one and two dimensions, continuous and discrete is considered. Some new theoretical results and some practical design techniques for conventional and unconventional filters are presented. In some cases optimum discrete filters can be found conveniently by matrix inversion. In many cases a simple, iterative approximation technique using FFT can be used to carry out the design or to adjust the frequency response of filters."
"A new circuit simulator is described which combines the gate-to-gate signal propagation technique used in logic simulators with detailed device representation and circuit analysis at the gate level. MOTIS is specialized for analyses of MOS logic circuits during the prelayout and postlayout phases of a design. The device modeling takes account of the back-gate bias effects and the bidirectionality of transmission gates. The simulation mechanism and the detailed device modeling lead to simulation of the dependence of propagation delays on input waveforms. The loading and device capacitances are assumed to be constant and bootstrapping effects are not simulated. The simulator has been implemented on a minicomputer having a 32K-word memory of 16-bit words, a disk module, and a storage CRT/keyboard terminal. This configuration allows simulation of circuits having 1000 gates with an operational speed of approximately 2 ms of real time per gate per nanosecond of circuit time."
  "A method for determining a positive real impedance matrixZ(s), givenZ(s) - Z'(- s), is presented."
"The attenuation and the frequency-stability characteristics of the voltage and the current transfer functions (at 180° phase-shift) of some well-known two-port three-terminal nonuniform distributed parameter (NUDP) networks are presented. These results reveal, perhaps for the first time, the pattern of variation of the frequency stability with respect to the attenuation (at 180° phase shift) of the transfer function of a NUDP structure. It is observed that, for a given set of values of tapering factor, position of input end, load impedance, and source impedance, there is a unique physical length of each specimen of the NUDP network associated with a particular frequency of phase reversal at which the attenuation of the transfer function is the minimum."
"This paper describes a thin-film hybrid integrated circuit (HIC) which is specifically manufactured to realize cascadable biquadratic active RC filter sections. The HIC consists of an RC network with one operational amplifier. This network is interconnected by a printed wiring board to realize Friend's Single Amplifier Biquad (SAB) and other filter sections. Design equations, components, predistortion method, and laser trimming are all discussed."
"A comparative study of single-amplifier filters, fifteen different two-amplifier circuits, and the state-variable three-amplifier configuration is given. The figures-of-merit used are the passive sensitivities, the\\omega_0gain-sensitivity products, theQgain-sensitivity products, and the\\omega_0andQdeviations due to the amplifiers' limited bandwidth. In addition, practical matters such as input impedance and component spread are considered. Among the circuits considered a particular twoamplifier resonator emerges as the \"best\" biquadratic section. Some of the interesting results include a unified expression, applicable to a large class of low-sensitivity circuits, for the\\omega_0deviation due to the amplifier's limited frequency response. In this expression, which applies for all active filters which have low\\omega_0active sensitivities, the only configurationdependent quantities are theQgain-sensitivity products."
"Statistical analysis using the Monte Carlo method is shown to have significant value in the design of practical circuits. Three integrated circuit examples are described; a logic circuit with critical dc properties, a gate with stringent transient requirements, and a hybrid circuit which combines precise linear high-frequency and transient performance. Characterization and modeling problems are described in detail. A particular device family is described by deriving statistics for the parameters of a single nonlinear model, which is then used directly for dc and transient cases and can be linearized for ac applications. Parasitic elements are included for fast high-frequency applications. Complex performance criteria are derived in a post-processor in order that the results be expressed by figures of merit which are practically meaningful, such as noise immunity of a logic gate and operating margin of a digital repeater."
"An algorithm is presented for solving nonlinear ordinary differential equations that generates a broad class of implicit linear differentiation formulas. Specific interest is concerned in one type of formula which for constant timestep reduces to the well-known Gear formulas. Although these formulas are mathematically fully equivalent to the BDF formulas as presented by Brayton et al. [1], their construction is quite different. Instead of using previously calculated function values, we employ predictions extrapolated from these values to set up and evaluate the differentiation formula. A recursive relation for these predictions is derived in order to simplify their calculation in the next timestep. As predictions are needed for order and error control, our algorithm appears to be more efficient as to the number of arithmetic operations than Brayton's algorithm, as well as more general and systematic. Moreover, a change of the order can be accomplished without extra work. Due to the available predictions, an interpolation to determine function values at intermediate time instants, as for instance required in plotting procedures, can be performed in a fast way."
"An upper bound for the amplitude of the limit cycles at the output of each section of all-pole digital filters consisting of a cascade of first- and second-order sections is obtained when the input of the filter is zero. A bound for the quantization error can be obtained by slightly modifying the obtained result. Also, the effect of the zeros of the transfer function, when they exist, on these bounds is considered."
"Digital interpolators can be used to increase the sampling rate of a sampled waveform when the limitations of analog to digital converter circuitry may prevent obtaining directly the increased sampling rate. As Schafer and Rabiner have shown [1], the interpolation process can be viewed as a linear filtering operation which produces output samples at a rate different from the input rate. In this paper, the interest is in the case where the output rate is an integral multiple of the input. The interpolating filter can be realized in a transversal or serial form in which the output samples are obtained in serial form. However, by rearranging the delays, weights, and outputs, the output samples may be obtained in parallel form. The reason for seeking parallel outputs is that parallel arithmetic may be performed without the need for commutators, and at a slower rate than serial arithmetic. If the sampling rate is to be increased by a factor L, L parallel outputs are obtained. By means of specific examples, the various methods for obtaining parallel outputs are shown. The examples are 3-point interpolators (i.e., each interpolated value is a linear combination of three input sample values) used for tripling the sampling rate. Generalizations to higher order interpolators are given and an example shows a 4-point interpolator for quadrupling the sampling rate. The Appendix gives the numerical values of digital impulse responses for various Lagrangian interpolators."
"Continuous automatic gain control (AGC) amplifiers have received much attention in the past due to their widespread usage in radar, sonar, communications, and other electronic systems. A reexamination of the AGC problem for the discrete-time counterpart is presented in this paper. It is shown that the appealing notion of merely equating the response with the sampled response of an analogous continuous model is often not satisfactory, especially when the response time is of the order of the sampling time. A general solution to the large-signal response of the discrete AGC amplifier involves a nonlinear difference equation and is solved by using a discrete Volterra series representation. Several feedback functions that have received attention in the past for continuous AGC amplifiers are considered: exponential,pth-law, and linear. In addition, a new configuration called \"geometric feedback\" is introduced that has certain desirable properties, namely, the feedback function can be tailored to give the desired large-signal transient response while the small-signal bandwidth remains independent of input level."
"The series connection\\Sigma_{12}linear time-invariant systems\\Sigma_1and\\Sigma_2that have minimal state space system descriptions is considered. From these descriptions strict system equivalent polynomial matrix system descriptions in the manner of Rosenbrock are derived. They are based on the factorization of the transfer matrix of the subsystems as a \"ratio\" of two right or left coprime polynomial matrices. They give rise to a simple polynomial matrix system description of the tandem connection\\Sima_{12}. Theorem 1 states that for the complete controllability and observability of the state space system description of\\Sigma_12it is necessary and sufficient that certain \"denominator\" and \"numerator\" groups are coprime. Consequences for feedback systems are drawn in Corollary 1. The role of pole-zero cancellations is explained by Lemma 3 and Corollaries 2 and 3."
"Impedance matching networks couple a generator to a load. When lossless matching elements are used, the load powerPand the powerP'extracted from the generator terminals are the same. Then the familiar conjugate impedance match condition maximizesP', and henceP. But if the matching elements are lossyP \\neq P'; the power differenceP' - Pis wasted in the matching network. MaximizingP'does not maximizeP. Suppose the load is purely resistive and that the quality factors of all elements used in the matching network must not exceed a prescribed valueQ. If the load resistance valueRis not prescribed, but can be adjusted to facilitate matching, then the maximum obtainable load power isP_m, given by Theorem 1. WhenRis prescribed, the maximum power may be less thanP_m. However, there is a range of load resistance values, wide in many cases, for which Theorem 2 applies to deliver the same maximum powerP_m.P_mdepends onQand on another quality factorqof the generator.P_mis small ifQ \\ll q, as may be the case if the generator is a short receiving antenna."
"As the design of crystal and mechanical filters requires a knowledge of techniques not generally known to the designer of LC filters, these techniques are emphasized in this paper. The paper discusses the commonality of mechanical resonance possessed by these filters and how this leads to design restrictions. The basics of resonator theory are discussed and also the coupling techniques used to make multi-resonator filters. A listing is supplied of the types of filters that are generally made with mechanical or crystal resonators. A flow chart shows the normal design process, and the electrical transformations that are commonly used to develop the LC designs into useful form are also described. The subjects of tuning techniques and manufacturing methods, in general, are discussed as they can have an important bearing on these types of filters. The properties of the materials conmmonly used for the resonators and the transducers are described, as well as the restrictions that they in turn place on the design process. The paper concludes with a discussion of some topics where more work can and should be done. The aim of the paper is to impart to the nonspecialist some idea of how this important class of filters is designed and manufactured, as well as giving an idea of the performance that can reasonably be expected from them."
"Algorithms are derived for realization of two-dimensional recursive digital filters using direct forms and continued fraction expansions. Included is a test for continued fraction expansion which at the same time determines the expansion coefficients. Transposed structures are also discussed, and a comparison is made of the various realizations."
"Recursive algebraic algorithms are developed for testing various stability properties of two-variable polynomials in a finite number of steps. Stability is tested with respect to either the half-plane or the unit circle applying only two times the equivalent of the Routh or Marden test, regardless of the degree of the polynomial."
"A unified approach to the analysis of periodically timevarying digital filters is introduced. It is shown that this method may be used to describe both time and frequency domain responses. By considering multirate filters as a special class of periodically time-varying filters we have characterized the frequency response of a general multirate filter. A time domain synthesis procedure for periodically varying difference equations is also presented."
"A class of low-sensitivity digital ladder filters may be realized in the voltage-current domain by direct analogy with the continuous resistively terminated LC ladder filter. The problem of unrealizability that is implied by delay-free loops in the discrete signal flow graph is overcome by using transformations that correspond to LC elements that exhibit finite Cube factors. The resultant deterioration in the passband of the transfer function is determined from the Blowstein LC ladder sensitivity theory and is, thereby, shown to be low valued at high sampling frequencies. The sensitivity properties of this class of digital ladder filters are directly analogous to the LC prototype because each LC element is replaced by a digital multiplier. Consequently, if maximum power transfer is approximately maintained throughout the passband of the LC prototype, then the first-order sensitivity of the corresponding digital transfer function to multiply a coefficient quantization is necessarily low valued."
"A statistical approach is proposed for estimating the necessary coefficient word length of a digital filter. With this statistical word length definition, an optimization procedure is then proposed for minimizing the statistical word length for a given filter structure and a given set of maximum error constraints. It is shown that by minimizing this statistical word length, the actual coefficient word length upon rounding of the coefficients can generally be reduced as well. Several examples are given and improvements of one to three bits in the actual coefficient word length are observed. The procedure does not necessarily lead to the actual global minimum coefficient word length."
"Several techniques are presented, both iterative and noniterative, for synthesizing a' recursive digital filter whose amplitude spectrum approximates a desired shape. The synthesis is carried out by implementing known algorithms for rational function approximation of a continuous function on a finite interval. In particular, techniques for synthesizing the best rational function approximation in the Chebyshev sense and in the least squares sense are treated. Examples are given which illustrate the quality of approximation achievable through each technique."
"Cubic natural splines have been used to design finite duration digital filters. The design is carried out in the time domain. Cubic splines can now be used to design digital filters by a mere algebraic substitution in a formula."
"The Remez exchange algorithm is extended for the design of two-dimensional nonrecursive digital filters approximating circularly symmetrical low-pass specifications according to a weighted Chebyshev error norm. Since the approximating function does not satisfy the Haar condition, the optimal solution is not necessarily unique and a straightforward extension of the one-dimensional exchange method may fail to converge. It is shown how the algorithm has to be complemented with a perturbation technique in order to force convergence under all circumstances. In the case of nonuniqueness the solution provided by the algorithm is a vertex of the polyhedron containing all optimal solutions, and a method is given which allows one to compute an adjacent vertex located on the same edge, thereby allowing the successive determination of all the vertices defining the polyhedron. For this case also, a procedure is described which selects, among all optimal solutions, the best one according to some additional criterion. Finally, the efficiency and accuracy aspects of the algorithm are considered and practical conclusions are drawn as an aid for the designer."
"In this paper, image-restoration techniques based upon a regression model are analyzed and verified by computer simulation. A regression model is formulated to describe image blurring, additive noise, physical image sampling, and quadrature representation. Classical estimation methods utilized for image restoration are described and related to one another. Restorations obtained by these classical techniques are shown to be poor because of noise disturbances and the ill conditioning of the image-degradation regression model. Constrained restoration methods which avoid ill conditioning problems are introduced. Computer simulations demonstrate that a boundedness constraint on the brightness of a reconstructed image provides significantly improved restorations as compared to unconstrained methods."
"This paper deals with the digital restoration of scanning electron micrographs. The properties of the signal and noise generated when recording a micrograph are analyzed and used to develop the optimal Wiener filter for enhancing the image. The transfer function of the display device, as well as the frequency foldover produced by sampling the image are included in the model. The mean-square-error measure is used in deriving the optimal filter, and it is shown that weighting this measure to reflect the spatial frequency response of the eye is of no benefit. A number of micrographs illustrate the success of restoration at different magnifications. In the opinion of some microscopists, the computer enhancement has produced significant, although not dramatic, improvements in the quality of the images."
"A new recursive procedure, based on state-space techniques and the use of a Kalman-Bucy filter is presented to solve the restoration problem of images degraded by motion in one direction. Both the noisefree and the noisy cases are considered."
"A nonlinear method of estimating pictorial data from noisy observations is considered. The data is assumed to be composed of an object with one texture in the background. An edge detection technique using likelihood functions is used to decide if an incoming picture element is a member of the object or the background. Then, the picture element is directed to one of the two Kalman filters designed based upon the statistics of the object or the background accordingly."
"A synthetic-aperture system, such as a coherent sidelooking radar, records a quasi-hologram of the scene which is illuminated by the transmitted radiation. Conventionally, the recorded pattern is converted to an image using optical processing. However, optical processing does not always provide the flexibility, dynamic range, or accuracy necessary to produce optimum images. Digital processing offers the potential for more generalized processing operations which provide large dynamic range and can correct for system aberrations and other image degrading effects. This paper presents a general method of digital processing which has been developed for synthetic aperture systems. Results are given for processing of radar, sonar, and millimeterwave recordings."
"Effects of timing jitter in digital filtering of analog signals are analyzed. Jitter may be introduced into the system when the incoming analog signal is being sampled and when the samples of the output of the digital filter are being read out for reconstruction back into an analog signal. These two jitters are called readin and readout jitters, respectively. General expressions are derived for the spectrum of the analog output in the presence of jitter and for the mean-square error introduced by the jitter. Four specific cases are then considered. They are readin jitter only, readout jitter only, independent jitter, and locked jitter. In each case, the general expression for the spectrum of the analog output is reduced to a more explicit form, and a simple upper bound on the mean-square error is derived. An example is included to illustrate the effect of high-frequency jitter and the effect of jitter due to 60-cycle pickup."
"Interval algebras are introduced as media in which to simulate digital filters for the purpose of analyzing quantization effects due to finite wordlength. The theory presented forms the basis of a computer-aided analysis scheme which generates confidence interval error bounds on the time domain response of a digital filter. The techniques are applicable to filters of arbitrary order and configuration implemented in either fixed or floating-point arithmetic. Experimental data is presented for a fourth-order low-pass Butterworth filter realized with fixed-point arithmetic in the direct, canonical direct, parallel, cascade, and ladder configurations. An example of Parker and Hess is used to illustrate the bounding limit cycles with interval techniques."
"On the basis of a theorem of Barkin, a number of criteria are derived which give sufficient conditions for the absence of zero-input limit cycles in discrete-time and especially digital systems. These criteria are formulated in the frequency domain and provide a possibility of investigating the absence of a zero-input limit cycle of a specific lengthN. Depending on the particular characteristics of the nonlinearities and the number of nonlinearities in the system, different criteria are obtained. Application of the criteria results in most cases in a linear programming problem. The solutions to this problem for the case of a second-order digital filter with one and with two quantization nonlinearities are discussed."
"Parasitic oscillations can occur in digital filters due to the granularity of the signal and to overflow. It is shown that for wave digital filters, the earlier concept of pseudopower leads to a function called stored pseudopower, from which a simple criterion guaranteeing absence of parasitic oscillations can be derived. For fixed-point two's-complement arithmetic, this criterion can be taken into account by particularly simple requirements for the adaptor output signals. A special type of calculus is developed which makes it possible to derive the corresponding simple requirements for the chopping operations at the various stages of the signal processing in the adaptors. The method is extended to cover scaling."
"In first-order two-dimensional digital filters, limit cycles can occur as a result of rounding off after multiplication. Such limit cycles are discussed for the case of fixed point arithmetic. The period and bounds for the amplitude of the limit cycles existing in the rows, columns, and diagonals are obtained. It is proved here that the bound obtained is the tightest possible bound for the amplitude of the limit cycles. Several (sufficient or necessary) conditions for the existence of the limit cycles in the rows, columns, and diagonals are also given."
   "This paper describes experiments on shocks which form and propagate along an easily constructed nonlinear and dispersive transmission line. The steepening of the shock front as observed here can be useful in ultra-fast switching operations in electronic circuits."
"A model proposed recently for an operational amplifier gyrator circuit is used to develop a compensation technique whereby the useful bandwidth of the gyrator circuit can be increased. The compensation technique is verified first by computer-aided analysis and then by experiment. It is shown that a significant increase in the useful gyrator bandwidth can be achieved by using an inexpensive capacitor. The compensation technique is then applied in the design of a gyrator-C channel-bank filter. The influence of dc-supply voltage and ambienttemperature variations on the performance of the filter is examined."
"It is shown that an all-pass function with complex poles can always be constructed by adding an appropriate all pole function to a first order all-pass function. This method has several advantages: 1) the complex pole sensitivities of the resulting all-pass network are the same as the pole sensitivities of the all pole network; 2) the output of the all pole network is available as an aid in tuning the network as well as for other purposes; 3) the method yields an abundance of networks. Three new all-pass realizations are derived to illustrate this method. One of the realizations is analyzed in detail, and analysis results are given for the other two realizations. For all three examples considered, the zero sensitivity magnitudes are approximately equal to the pole sensitivity magnitudes of the all pole function."
"General design formulae are derived for the synthesis of a third-order low-pass filter with a finite transmission zero. The design procedure uses a unity gain positive feedback amplifier, with balanced twin-T RC networks. A design example is given for a fifth-order elliptic filter, whose performance is compared to the ideal computed response."
"An algorithm for locating gray level and/or texture edges in digitized pictures is presented. The algorithm is based on the concept of hypothesis testing. The digitized picture is first subdivided into subsets of picture elements, e.g.,2 \\times 2arrays. The algorithm then compares the first- and second-order statistics of adjacent subsets; adjacent subsets having similar first- and/or second-order statistics are merged into blobs. By continuing this process, the entire picture is segmented into blobs such that the picture elements within each blob have similar characteristics. The boundaries between the blobs comprise the boundaries. The algorithm always generates closed boundaries. The algorithm was developed for multispectral imagery of the earth's surface. Application of this algorithm to various image processing techniques such as efficient coding, information extraction (terrain classification), and pattern recognition (feature selection) are included."
"A procedure for extracting edge information from real photographs of both flat-faced and curved three-dimensional objects is described. Initially the photograph is subjected to a nonlinear transformation which is based on an edge detection operator by Hueckel. The gray-value variations of a photograph are transformed into short vectors (strokes), which are arranged in a two-dimensional array that has substantially fewer entries than the original image array. The display of a stroke array provides \"outline\" information that is highly intelligible to the human eye. Using graph searching techniques, strokes are assembled into structures called streaks. Streaks are digital curves which exhibit cellular as well as polygonal properties. The representation of streaks as well as other data can be marked directly in the stroke array, thus making the array usable as an associative memory. This greatly facilitates further processing."
"The Laplace-transform technique is utilized to obtain exact time-domain solutions in closed form for commensurate distributed-line networks when their transfer or return functions in the complex Richards variable are known. Extensive tables for transform pairs, and general relations as well, are given. The case with an additional irrational factor of the transfer function is also studied. Some illustrating examples of how to apply the transform technique are provided."
"A new simple and general synthesis method for realizing any RC-voltage transfer function by unsymmetrical lattice network is developed. It gives minimal realizations with minimum number of capacitors, including the one with all the capacitors grounded. With two additional operational amplifiers, such a realization can be converted into more useful active realization."
"New results concerned with the Lyapunov stability and with estimates of trajectory behavior and bounds of composite or interconnected systems, described by ordinary differential equations, are established. In all cases the objective is the same: to analyze composite systems in terms of their lower order subsystems and in terms of their interconnecting structure. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the present method, four specific examples are considered."
 "One-dimensional spot-detection operators were tested on simulated noisy \"Morse code\" input. Good results were obtained at binomial noise levels up to 20 percent."
   "In the case of linear time-invariant networks, a set of simple recursive formulae are deduced for the first- and higher order sensitivity coefficients of the network voltages and currents with respect to the component values. These formulae are based on Branin's hybrid formulation method but include terms corresponding to dependent drivers. It is shown that the chief computational effort in using these formulae involves a single matrix inversion or LU factorization carried out once."
"A high-pass notch filter with variable gain greater than unity is realized using a differential amplifier and only two capacitors that can be equal. The transmission zero and pole frequency are completely independent of the amplifier dc gain. Design formulas, sensitivity analysis, and measure and trim tuning process are presented. An example of a 60-Hz rejection filter is discussed, the response of which is within the required specifications even with a\\pm5-percent capacitance variation. Two modifications of the original structure can be used to realize the same filter, extending the available range of the gain to cover all requirements."
"A synthesis method for constant-resistance all-pass networks is described. It only employs gyrators and capacitive elements. The measured results show a good agreement with theory."
"A systematicRC-active network synthesis procedure for the realization of second-order transfer functions is proposed. The realization employs three operational amplifiers and no isolation amplifiers are necessary. The sensitivity of the resulting networks to passive element variations has been found to be low. The sensitivity to variations in the active elements has been made very low. A design is given in which tuning can be achieved by trimming only resistors. The design is particularly attractive for high-Qrealizations. The stability properties and the influence of the finite bandwidth of the amplifiers are examined. The proposed realization has been compared with those of Kerwin, Huelsman, and Newcomb, of Tarmi and Ghausi, and of Thomas, and found to offer several attractive features as compared to these realizations. The design procedure was used to obtain a sixth-order elliptic bandpass filter. Experimental results show close agreement between theory and practice. Further, these results indicate that these realizations are insensitive to temperature and power supply variations."
"The usual assumptions for the tolerance problem in the frequency domain are that the worst cases occur at boundary points of a tolerance region, and that the acceptable region is simply connected. These assumptions are investigated and conditions for validity are given for the class of networks which have bilinear dependence on the parameter of interest. This paper elaborates on an underlying assumption made in a theorem proposed by Bandler."
"In previous work, it was shown that the sensitivity of the state variables of a circuit with respect to the initial-state conditions could be used advantageously to determine the steady-state periodic response of an oscillator or periodically forced system. In this paper, a computational technique for computing this sensitivity is presented which does not necessitate the formulation of the state equations so that the algorithm can be implemented into many current circuit transient analysis programs without major changes. The method yields valid results even when the capacitor voltages and inductor currents are not an independent set of state variables."
"A spatial clustering procedure applicable to multispectral image data is discussed. The procedure takes into account the spatial distribution of the measurements as well as their distribution in measurement space. The procedure calls for the generation and then thresholding of the gradient image, cleaning the thresholded image, labeling the connected regions in the cleaned image, and clustering the labeled regions. An experiment was carried out on ERTS data in order to study the effect of the selection of the gradient image, the threshold, and the cleaning process. Three gradients, three gradient thresholds, and two cleaning parameters yielded 18 gradient-thresholds combinations. The combination that yielded connected homogeneous regions with the smallest variance was Robert's gradient with distance 2, thresholded by its running mean, and a cleaning process that considered a resolution cell to be homogeneous if and only if at least 7 of its nearest neighbors were homogeneous."
"A nonstationary linear digital filter is designed and implemented which extracts the natural features from high-altitude imagery of agricultural areas. Essentially, from an original image a new image is created which displays information related to soil properties, drainage patterns, crop disease, and other natural phenomena, and contains no information about crop type or row spacing. A model is developed to express the recorded brightness in a narrowband image in terms of man-made and natural contributions and which describes statistically the spatial properties of each. The form of the minimum mean-square error linear filter for estimation of the natural component of the scene is derived and a suboptimal filter is implemented. Nonstationarity of the two-dimensional random processes contained in the model requires a unique technique for deriving the optimum filter. Finally, the filter depends on knowledge of field boundaries. An algorithm for boundary location is proposed, discussed, and implemented."
"In this paper, we argue that in order to be able to build meaningful image filters, we have to have a world model, a description of the world that we are dealing with. This world model includes a model of the scene, a model of the eye (camera), and a model of the illumination. Secondly, using this description, we have to recognize objects in the scene which match this description before we can remove them, that is, filter them out. Thirdly, we show that the strategy of sequencing the procedures (deciding which object in the scene is recognized when) is guided by the world model and the visibility of objects on the scene. Since the filtering process involves recognition of the visual concepts of objects, we call it conceptual filtering. Similarly, since the guided strategy of the scene analysis, depends on partial recognition of the scene, we call it conceptual focusing. The preceding points are demonstrated by a concrete example of computer recognition of bridges, rivers, lakes, and islands from ERTS satellite pictures."
"An exact method is presented to find a new class of parametrical polynomials which provides(n - m)zero derivatives of relative delay atp = 0andmzero derivatives aboutp = \\infty. Explicit expressions of the polynomials forn = 2,3,4,5, and6(and for0 \\leq m \\leq n) are derived from a linear second-order differential equation. Among the possible applications of these polynomials we show their interest in equalizing a class of microwave filters and for design of multiplexing systems."
"By the construction of an appropriate numerical example, Fialkow demonstrated the existence of a non-series-parallel 3-terminal RC network for which a series-parallel equivalent was intrinsically impossible. Starting from the set of short-circuit admittance functionscorresponding to this network and using computer synthesis methods, the authors obtained a number of realizations, or possibly near-realizations, for this set of functions. In view of the theoretical interest involved, it was decided to check whether any of these realizations did, in fact, correspond to exact solutions of the synthesis problem; a number of such exact solutions were found and are exhibited in this paper together with other sets of short-circuit admittance functions that can only be realized as 3-terminal RC networks in non-series-parallel form."
"This paper shows that by mapping the range of the variable element in the classical Bode variable equalizer from0 \\leq R \\leq \\inftyto- R_0 \\leq R \\leq R_0, one arrives at a different formulation of the equalizer transfer function.[ Canadian and U.S. Patent Applications pending.] This transfer function suggests new forms of variable equalizer network structures. The advantage of these structures is that they require only a single shaping immittance for realization, thus enabling simulation of coaxial cable losses in terms ofRCor\\overline{RC}networks alone. This is important in hybrid IC realizations. Furthermore, active realizations provide basic building blocks for direct cascading of multiple sections. An experimental RC variable equalizer has been designed for\\pm10 dB continuously variable magnitude range and the measured responses are shown to be in excellent agreement with those evaluated from the computer-simulated model."
"Numerical integral and differential operators are developed using Walsh transforms. These are matrices with coefficients for integrating Walsh functions and their inverses. Their application to linear differential equations yields a simple algebraic solution. It is clear that this solution is the mean value over each subinterval of the true solution to the defined differential equation."
"The main part of this paper describes how to create efficiently a data structure which allows the use of approximation techniques to obtain consistent polygonal outlines of the objects in a picture. In addition, it gives a method for editing the regions obtained from the application of a segmentation algorithm. Examples involving solid geometrical objects, X-ray pictures, and human faces are given."
"Two equivalent linear circuits, which have neither capacitance loops nor inductance cut-sets, may be linked by a continuous equivalent transformation such that the individual sensitivities with respect to L's and C's are not invariant."
"The automated de design of electronic networks is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem the solution of which is performed with nonlinear optimization algorithms. Special attention is given to an appropriate form of an error criterion which is able to meet practical design requirements. The proposed form of the error criterion leads to good convergence properties, especially in the case that certain requirements are strongly violated. The nonlinear dc analysis uses node variables and the well-known Newton-Raphson algorithm. As active elements models of diodes, Zener diodes, bipolar transistors, JFET's and MOSFET's are implemented in the developed design program. An example is given which shows the practicability of this program."
"An absolute bound on limit cycles and roundoff noise in fixed-point digital filters is derived. The bound is easily computed in terms of the poles and zeros of the discrete transfer function. In addition, the bound is compared to other absolute and rms bounds."
 "The computer implementation of a numerical algorithm for obtaining rational approximations is discussed. This method offers the promise of a comprehensive solution to the problems of two-dimensional recursive digital filter design. Combination of this technique with an easily implemented stability test avoids current stability problems in present methods and places no restrictions as to type on filters that may be designed. Both one- and two-dimensional filters may be designed with this technique."
 "The Fermat number transform has been proposed as an aid to the rapid and precise computation of convolutions for digital filtering applications, but because it is less flexible than the fast Fourier transform, while more efficient, its applicability to one-dimensional filtering situations is somewhat limited. The purpose of this letter is to call attention to the fact that the constraints associated with filtering by Fermat number transforms are far less restrictive for two-dimensional filtering, and that, in fact, the Fermat number transform is well matched to the requirements of two-dimensional linear filtering."
"The design of broad-band high-frequency transistor amplifiers is a difficult and challenging outstanding problem in active network theory of great practical importance. New and explicit optimum gain-bandwidth limitations of high-frequency transistor amplifiers for arbitrary prescribed transistor gain rolloff characteristics are presented. The transistor is modeled as a reactively constrained active two-port network. The limitations derived and presented are applicable to the design of broad-band small-signal as well as high-power transistor amplifiers. Realization of a class of practical broad-band matching networks are also presented. The explicit gain-bandwidth limitations and the new realization results presented form the basis for a new broadbanding theory for high-frequency transistor amplifiers and represent a significant advancement in the design theory of active networks."
"A novel Y-circulator, constructed from operational amplifier (op-amp) weighted summers, consists of three op-amps and a few resistors and is integrable. It can be designed for three different or equal, complex or real, balanced or grounded terminations. The small leakage to the \"isolated\" port is caused by the finite common mode rejection of the op-amp and the sensitivity of the circuit to component deviations. One important merit of the new circulator is its ability to be designed for zero or finite gain, the gain-bandwidth product being, for a matched circulator, half that of the op-map. The circulator consists effectively of three \"stages\" or \"active hybrid networks.\" Measurements confirm the analytical expectations. Finally, circuits are suggested for the use in the telephone set, at the ends of long distance telephone transmission circuits, in bidirectional repeaters, in filter connection, and in gyrator realization."
"Attention is drawn to a number of possible variants in the detailed application of the coefficient matching technique to the computer synthesis of lumped linear networks. Tables of run times obtained with a numerical example provide some indication of the relative computational efficiency of the methods instanced. Simple closed form expressions for the optimum value of the multiplicative constant are derived for three variants; an illustrative table demonstrates that their use greatly improves the rate and range of convergence of the method."
"A method is developed for the computer-aided synthesis of a particular case of linear, lumped, passive, bilateral, lossless bandpass ladder filters. It involves the numerical values of the open-circuit immittance functions in three sets of equations referred to as the terminal, the remainder, and the junction algorithms. The filter model comprises two chains of LC sections, each of which contains one arbitrary component value and a finite frequency rejection circuit. The response of this model is exact, save for roundoff errors. The possibility of placing boundary values on all component values is then investigated through a systematic permutation of all finite frequency rejection circuits and by varying all arbitrary component values in a programmable number of steps. The process is applied to the example case design of a 70-MHz 14th-order filter."
"The memory cycle time of an IGFET read-only memory cell is designed using AOP, a program for automated and interactive optimization of electrical networks. It is shown how AOP allows the user to specify multiple performance objectives and to request analysis, and/or adjoint sensitivity computation, and/or automated optimization for networks described in the ASTAP input language. A. procedure is given for applying optimization to switching circuit design, and a summary is given of the hard experience gained from applying AOP to a practical problem in LSI design."
"The nodal method has been widely used for formulating circuit equations in computer-aided network analysis and design programs. However, several limitations exist in this method including the inability to process voltage sources and current-dependent circuit elements in a simple and efficient manner. A modified nodal analysis (MNA) method is proposed here which retains the simplicity and other advantages of nodal analysis while removing its limitations. A simple and effective pivoting scheme is also given. Numerical examples are used to compare the MNA method with the tableau method. Favorable results are observed for the MNA method in terms of the dimension, number of nonzeros, and fill-ins for comparable circuit matrices."
"Emphasis in this survey of hardware for visual image processing is on centers which specialize in \"computer vision\" research, although some of the findings are generally applicable to all areas of image processing. Tradeoffs between parameters of speed, dynamic range, and resolution are discussed as they apply to industrial and research applications. A discussion of various types of imaging devices and analog-to-digital converters follows. Next, problems which occur in various devices are discussed and some methods of compensation are suggested. Then, the three most popular methods of computer entry of image data are compared. The paper concludes with a brief description of visual image processing research in progress at nine laboratories, with emphasis on the hardware used by those laboratories as it relates to the problems being worked on."
"A solution is obtained to the problem of estimating the number, vector velocity, and waveshape of overlapping planewaves in the presence of interfering planewaves and channel noise, where previous solutions have assumed one or more of these quantities as known. A general optimum solution is not found; instead, a heuristic solution is presented along with a complete working implementation program for large scale computers. For the case where the number of waves and the vector velocities are known, the solution is optimum. The detection of waves and the estimation of their bearing, velocity, and waveshape is accomplished via digital filtering of the frequencywavenumber power spectrum, which is computed via an efficient estimator, of the array sensed data. A new approach to the multiwave estimation problem is to reduce it to a succession of single wave problems using especially developed frequency-wavenumber filters. Special attention is given throughout the study to computationally efficient approaches. The results of the paper are placed in perspective by showing how the historically important approaches to the processing of array data such as delay and sum, weighted delay and sum, array prewhitening, beam forming, inverse filtering, least mean-square estimation, and maximum likelihood estimation are related via the spatio-temporal filtering of the frequency-wavenumber spectrum. The spectral estimation, digital filtering, and the multiwave maximum likelihood estimator developments are demonstrated by the processing of a set of simulated planewaves of various bearings, velocities, and frequencies, as well as by processing electroencephalographic (brain wave) data monitored via an array of scalp electrodes."
"The current response of a finite distributed RC line to a voltage-step driving function has a closed-form solution in terms of elliptic theta functions. This seems to have gone unrecognized in previous circuit theory literature. Different types of theta functions will appear depending on whether the solution is for open-circuited or short-circuited terminations. Furthermore, the voltage response to the same driving function can be expressed in terms of integrals of theta functions. These integrals constitute a possibly new set of higher transcendental functions, to be denoted here as \"diffusion functions.\" Relationships among and properties of the various solutions and functions are given in mathematical identities and families of curves. Thus expressing the solutions in terms of individual functions whose properties are well-documented, rather than using the mostly opaque series form, allows a more distinct view of the physical behavior of the distributed RC line to emerge."
"An investigation of the relationship between the sensitivity coefficients and theK-matrix ofn-port networks is presented. The results available on theK-matrix and the adjoint network approach for sensitivity computations will form the basis of the discussions."
"A general technique for obtaining intermediate-band crystal filters from prototype low-pass (LP) networks which are neither symmetric nor antimetric is presented. This immediately enables us to now realize the class of low-transient responses. The bandpass (BP) filter appears as a cascade of symmetric lattice sections, obtained by partitioning the LP prototype filter, inserting constant reactances where necessary, and then applying the LP to BP frequency transformation."
"The existence of a component called a \"microprocessor\" is a natural outgrowth of our present ability to fabricate digital integrated circuits with immense internal complexity. A discussion on the internal logical structure of a typical microprocessor, the external interface it presents, how its performance parameters may be defined and measured, and some of the properties of systems in which it may be embedded, is presented."
"The relation is established between the determinant of the network equations for branch variables and the determinant of the cutset admittance matrix or the determinant of the loop impedance matrix for general linear, lumped, time-invariant networks composed of a finite collection of multiterminal elements."
"Abstraci-Bounds for the amplitude of limit cycle oscillations in recursive second-order digital filters with fixed-point arithmetic are derived. They apply when an input signal is present. Bounds are derived for all frequencies of limit cycle oscillations including zero frequency (transients)."
"An infinite series expansion of a sinusoid is used to find a tighter practical bound on quantization errors for second-order digital filters with complex conjugate poles. It is shown that the use of this new practical bound yields closer values to the lowest bound known which is impractical to calculate."
"Inductorless active filters which are derived from double terminated classical reactance filters, such as gyrator-capacitor filters and filters using the FDNR concept, are known to exhibit low sensitivity. Stimulated by the ideas underlying the method of wave digital filters the attempt has been made to establish a concept for the synthesis of active filters which is based on processing of wave quantities. In this paper the method leading to this new kind of active filters is presented and possibilities for practical implementation are shown. Some experimental results confirm the feasibility of the principle."
"It is shown that the amplifier gains in a two-amplifierRCactive filter section can be used to tune the center frequency of its bandpass characteristic in such a manner that the percent bandwidth remains essentially constant over the tuning range. Low-pass and high-pass tunable sections with constant pole-Qare also derived. Altogether, fourteen basic bandpass sections and six circuits each for the low-pass and the high-pass sections have been derived. Formulas for their parameters are given. A design example and experimental results are given."
"The dynamic behavior of a discrete-time method of synchronizing adigital data communications network is discussed. Necessary conditions for stability of some special cases are derived, and it is shown that, with a constant drift'rate of one or more clocks, the buffer stores eventually overflow, indicating the need for a modified control scheme."
"How the adjoint network can be specified when the branch equations have the formMv + Nj = 0."
"An efficient numerical algorithm is presented for the solution of transients in systems consisting of dynamic components with both slow and fast eigenvalues, interconnected at their terminals by an algebraic network. The approach consists of producing algebraic input-output equivalents for the individual components by implicit integration of their differential equations. The adopted implicit integration is by parts leaving the impulse response intact and unaffected by the numerical discretization. The effect of this procedure is excellent convergence with large step sizes, resulting in significant savings in computation. The method has been tested on a conveniently chosen large circuit and compared to alternative algorithms. It is successfully applied to the solution of power system transients problems (dynamic stability, switching transients). Although described for linear systems, the method can be applied for nonlinear systems, linearized after each step around the new operating point."
"Existence of the solution to the composite state space representation for large-scale composite (LSC) systems is discussed for a specified multilevel structure. It is shown that the multilevel structure causes the existence condition to be decomposed so each constituent in the structure is considered separately. The LSC system is represented by a digraph and an algorithm using graph theory to identify the constituents of the multilevel structure is given."
"A mathematical, normal form system, with the minimum dynamical order of two, capable of generating a wide class of periodic waveforms is presented. The techniques of the method may be used to enunciate an autonomous oscillator with the desired waveform appearing as one of the state variables, or the same basic approach will allow the construction of a simple waveshaping network that when driven with externally generated sine and cosine functions, will produce the same prescribed waveform. A canonic circuit is also given that, when used in such a waveshaping network, can obviate the realization of nonmonotonicI- Vcurves. The oscillator produced by this method can sometimes lead to tunnel points, a concept introduced by Chua and Green. These points are thoroughly discussed in connection with the results, and a simple method is presented that can often eliminate these points, as well as lead to nonlinearities that are easier to realize in practice."
"It is shown that the Routh-Hurwitz test may be used to determine the numbers and the multiplicities of real polynomial roots. Examples are given with applications to positive real testing."
"The analysis of many linear circuits would be simplified if coupling terms associated with a critically located node or branch could be specified. The use of phantom sources allows arbitrary specification of node voltages or branch currents in exchange for the introduction of more tractable alternative variables."
 "Koenig's generalized theorem for the convergence of the poles of Pade approximants is used to determine the minimum magnitude real and complex conjugate roots ofnth-order polynomials. This is then used for the reduction of linear time-invariant systems."
"High-frequency limitations of a generalized immittance converter (GIC) and leapfrog (coupled-biquad) ladder structures are compared. It is shown that the high-frequency limitations of GIC derivedRC-active ladder filters are improved very significantly by employing simulated-inductance and/or frequency-dependent negative resistance (FDNR) elements for which theQfactor is made virtually independent of the gain-bandwidth products of the two operational amplifiers in each GIC. The behavior of such GIC derived structures with respect to variations in temperature is further improved by using dual operational amplifiers for each GIC instead of individual ones."
"The necessity proof for the realizability conditions of cascaded transmission-line networks is provided. The realizability conditions were stated by Boakye and Wing."
"It is shown that the sensitivities of resistively terminatedLCladder networks can be significantly reduced by inserting losses into the internal sections of the overall structure. Sensitivity improvements on the order of 20 percent are obtained for many of the filters considered. This observation is particularly useful in active ladder (leapfrog) synthesis where the additional losses are readily compensated, if necessary, by the gains of the active elements. To achieve optimum overall sensitivity, a previously introduced statistical multiparameter sensitivity measure is minimized."
"A method is described for the optimization of nonlinear dc circuits. A performance index is defined to measure the difference. between the desired and the actual specifications. The novel approach taken here is to treat the network equations as equality constraints on the design parameters. The constrained optimization problem is then converted to an unconstrained one by a penalty function technique. A straightforward method is given for computing all the gradients needed during the optimization, given only the topology of the network and the branch relationships. This makes the algorithm easily amenable to a package program."
"An efficient approach to the computer-aided transient analysis of lumped-distributed linear networks is presented. The method is based on obtaining the transfer function of the circuit by symbolic techniques and the transient response is computed using the fast Fourier transform (FFT), the shifting parameteraand the new two-dimensional weighting factors\\omega_{n}, \\varepsilon_{r}. Experimental observations give ample evidence of good agreement between the theoretical and computed results for different values ofaand\\omega_{n}, \\varepsilon_{r}. The algorithm used provides a large saving in computing time and computer memory when compared with available techniques."
"The forced response of a general type of digital filter, implemented with overflow nonlinearities, is studied. A definition of stability of this forced response is given. It is indicated that this stability can be studied by means of the zero-input behavior of a system, with the same structure but with time-varying nonlinearities. A theorem is derived giving sufficient conditions for the stability of the forced response of a digital system. Some results of the application of this theorem to wave digital filters are given."
"Given a multiport transfer functionA, the question arises whether it can be realized using feedback loops of shortest possible length. The most elegant way to achieve this is to realizeAin cascade form, with each subsystem in the cascade of smallest possible degree. Any transfer matrix of finite degree is a matrix whose entries are rational functions of the complex variablep, and a cascade synthesis of such ap-matrix will bear heavily on the properties of the factorization of rationalp-matrices into simpler factors. We will call ap-matrix of the first degree an elementary factor. It is shown that 1) a nonsingular rationalp-matrix can be factored into a minimal product of elementary factors provided either all poles or zeros are of the first order but not necessarily of the first degree; 2) that any nonsingular matrix can be factored into a product of elementary factors with the bound on the number of factors being a function of the degree of the matrix; and 3) that there are matrices which cannot be factored out minimally. Factorization procedures in special cases were first deduced by Belevitch and Youla, and later, using an improved criterion for degree reduction, by the first author. These procedures all use unitary or so-calledJ-unitary elementary factors. The theory presented here uses a general type of elementary factor to attack the problem of cascade decomposition of a general nonsingular transfer function. Thus the question whether a general (rational) multiport can be synthesized by means of feedback loops of length one has to be answered negatively although a very large number of systems can, and a criterion is given to distinguish the two cases. Also, an algorithm and an example are presented to exhibit how the factorization (if it exists) can be constructed."
"The continued fraction used to obtain the transfer function of the Bessel filter is modified by adding a parametera>-1to the odd integers in the expansion. The resulting transfer function is realizable and has a time delay at\\omega = 0which is independent of the order of the filter, and which may be varied from 0 to\\inftyby changinga. A further modification yields transfer functions from continued fraction expansions involving the even integers and the positive integers."
"A \"three-terminal series-parallel graph\" is defined to be a three-terminal graph which is constructed by means of repeating only specified series and parallel connections. This definition is based upon our previous work about transformerless interconnections of two-port networks. Some properties of the graph are shown under the foregoing definition and, especially, a theorem is given stating that a three-terminal graph is three-terminal series-parallel if and only if neither of two certain graphs can be obtained from it by opening or shorting some edges."
"The stated objective is to describe a procedure for determining the symbolic coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of a restricted class ofRLCnetworks through the eigenvalue approach of Bashkow'sAmatrix. Theorem 2 is an algebraic method to determine each coefficient of the characteristic polynomial of anLCnetwork (called half-degenerate) which has noC-only-circuits norL-only-cutsets. The method uses Wang algebra but does not have to enumerate trees. Even for a large scale of half-degenerateLCnetwork each coefficient can be obtained algebraically, as well as individually, from Wang algebra operations of its elements\\{C_1,C_2,\\cdots,C_a,L_1,L_2,\\cdots,L_{n-a}\\}. This implies that for its determination the new method requires less effort in computation over the existing tree enumeration methods based on Wang algebra. Theorem 1 is a method to determine the characteristic polynomial of an RLC network which is generated from a half-degenerateLCnetwork by inserting resistors in series withL's and in parallel withC's. The significance of Theorem 1 is that 1) the characteristic polynomials of the half-degenerateLCsubnetworks, which are used to express the characteristic polynomial of theRLCnetwork, can be obtained from Theorem 2 in forms of power series of the complex frequencies variable 2, and then 2) the effect of insertion of loss parameters into a lossless network of ordernis clear."
"Necessary and sufficient conditions are presented such that a three-terminal element is a \"no-gain element,\" that is, such that any connected network containing that element, positive resistors, and independent sources, possesses the familiar no-voltage-gain and no-current-gain properties. The implications of the results are discussed, when applied to networks containing various three-terminal semiconductor devices such as bipolar transistors, field-effect transistors, and siliconcontrolled rectifiers. In particular, it is shown how one can establish that such elements are no-gain elements. Furthermore, it is shown that three-terminal elements are not no-gain elements as a consequence of their passivity, but rather, that the converse is in fact true. Finally, the nogain property is used to extend significantly an earlier result wherein the existence of solutions to the dc equations of certain classes of transistor circuits is proved."
"Novel variable equalizer structures (Canadian and U.S. patent application pending.) based on the concept of inductorless simulation of classical Bode variable equalizers are discussed. It is shown that one can remove the need for negative resistance (in a full range equalizer) by switching between negative and positive feedback, thus saving an operational amplifier. A number of typical equalizer responses with a variable range of\\pm10 dB are realized withRCcomponents and a single operational amplifier. The measured responses are shown to agree closely with the computer-simulated nominal network responses. In a particular example, a\\pm10 dB variable bump equalizer is realized with only two operational amplifiers in contrast to four required in a recent realization."
"Second-order active RC all-pass networks containing periodically operated switches are proposed in which the regulation of the switching parameter allows the independent adjustment of the delay characteristics. It is shown that the maximum delay time and its corresponding frequency are adjustable independently by changing the ratio of the on duration in a period to the period of switching. Two such circuits are presented along with experimental results which are in good agreement with the theoretical curves."
 "A problem is considered, proposed by K. Eisemann, which he solved with the use of generalized matrix inverses. A more general problem is discussed here, and solved by standard elementary methods."
"Negative impedance converters (NIC's) may be used to realize negative driving-point impedances. The effect of the nonideal characteristics of the operational amplifier such as finite frequencydependent gain and output impedance on the performance of the negative impedances is analyzed. Detailed equivalent circuits showing the additional positive or negative inductive impedances due to the nonideal characteristics are given for negative resistance and negative capacitance realizations, and their relative performances are compared. The experimental results confirm the validity of the equivalent circuits. The effect of the slew rate of the operational amplifier on the maximum signal-handling capability (SHC) of the negative impedances at high frequencies is studied. Practical design considerations for achieving wider bandwidth as well as improved SHC are discussed."
 "The noise performance characteristics of single amplifier RC active filters are presented for the cases where the circuits are constructed using the new single-ended Norton quad amplifiers. The power spectral densities and total rms values of the output noise are compared with the same quantities for filters constructed using conventional integrated operational voltage amplifiers. The conditions for minimum noise from the Norton amplifiers are derived, and these minimum levels are compared with those obtained using 741-type amplifiers. When the filters are constructed using infinite gain embedded amplifiers, for certain ranges of Q-factor and passband gain the Norton amplifiers can be biased to give comparable noise performance to the 741 amplifiers, and it is shown that the bias networks required differ significantly from those chosen in most specification sheets for these devices. For positive-gain structures, the 741 amplifiers are shown to be superior in most applications."
"If only a segment of a functionf (t)is given, then its Fourier spectrumF(\\omega)is estimated either as the transform of the product off(t)with a time-limited windoww(t), or by certain techniques based on various a priori assumptions. In the following, a new algorithm is proposed for computing the transform of a band-limited function. The algorithm is a simple iteration involving only the fast Fourier transform (FFT). The effect of noise and the error due to aliasing are determined and it is shown that they can be controlled by early termination of the iteration. The proposed method can also be used to extrapolate bandlimited functions."
"In this paper a method is described to compute the group delay of a minimum phase network from the attenuation characteristic via Hilbert transformation and spline function. The passband distortion due to dissipative loss can also be obtained with minimum amount of computation. The new approach eliminates all the numerical problems encountered in earlier attempts by many authors. As a result of its accuracy, the method can be profitably applied to assist the design of filters. An example is given to show the application and the numerical results of the method."
"A theory is developed for nonstationary network synthesis via state-space techniques. The method is based on direct realization algorithms from a Hankel matrix (input/output) description of the system. Passive, lossless, reciprocal, reversible, and relaxation systems are considered. For each of these classes of systems, necessary and sufficient conditions on the Hankel matrix for the existence of a representation which can be synthesized with certain types of network elements are derived. In addition, algorithms for computing these representations are presented."
"The formulation of matrix continued fraction of three Cauer matrix forms and their dynamic state equations for linear timeinvariant multivariable circuits and systems is derived. The state-space representation formulated in this paper is a minimal realization. Applications of this method to the inversion of a rational matrix whose entries are polynomials in s and to the reduction of a multivariable system are described."
"A systematic search method has been developed for obtaining the multiple solutions of a nonlinear equation of the formf(x) = 0, where f is a continuously differentiable function fromR^n \\rightarrrow R^n. The method is based on numerical integration of the associated system of differential equations\\dot{f}_i = -f_ifori = 1, 2,\\cdots , n - 1and\\dot{f}_n = \\pm f_nalong the space curvelof intersectionf_i(x) = 0, i = 1, 2,\\cdots, n - 1. The plus or minus sign is chosen so as to make\\{x_k\\}move in the desired direction onl."
"A solution to the identification problem for a class of nonlinear systems, based on steady-state frequency response, is presented. This class is composed of certain interconnections of stable linear dynamic systems and integer power nonlinearities. Two kinds of measurements are considered. The first involves obtaining the amplitude and relative phase of each harmonic of the steady-state frequency response, while the second involves measuring the amplitudes only. In each case we find the number of measurements sufficient to identify a system for which the highest power present and the bounds on the dimensions of the linear subsystems are known."

"The utility of broad-band interactive two-way visual telecommunication has been assessed in a wide variety of healthcare delivery settings in seven exploratory projects funded by the Bureau of Health Services Research, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. These projects are briefly summarized and communication events are classified into five exhaustive but not matually exclusive categories: consultation, supervision, direct patient care (telemedicine), administration and management, and education and training. Technical and human factors to be considered in the design of a visual telecommunication system are identified. Tradeoffs available among them are discussed, such as resolution for remote controls and frame rate. The impact of visual telecommunication on the often competitive performance goals of the health-care system is discussed, e.g., random video consultations may simultaneously decrease physician productivity and patient inconvenience. The paper concludes by suggesting directions for future research and by noting that broad-band video is but one among many technological, organizational, manpower, and other options available to those who seek solutions to the problems of health-care delivery."
"Definitions of separated-groups teleconferences, as opposed to person-to-person video telephone service, are reviewed. The teleconference facility, in terms of an audio mode, a graphics mode, and a video mode, can have an impact on the interactive, interpersonal communication process. Recent audio and audio/video teleconference experiments are summarized. Audio and video limitations of current technology have the potential of increasing transmission bandwidths and terminal complexity. For a large channel CATV network of more than 60 channels, teleconference service in the intracity context implies that CATV networks may have limited capacity for this service."
"Information systems will always remain a subset of interactive communications systems. These physical networks will reflect the relationships between people and information. The element of surprise will always remain, however. Suppose that the recent work at the Stanford Research Institute in communicating straight from the brain to computer augmentation is continued and is perfected. This will lead to innovation in a new area of terminal equipment beyond the conception of most of us with our present orientation. To imagine a life in that mode is difficult from our present expenence. The future of interactive telecommunication systems will be one of continuing change bounded by behavior and not technology."
"The principle and the equipment developed for the field trial on individualized still-picture communication applicable to a two-way CATV system are explained. Individualized still-picture communication is realized by a oneframe time-division-multiplex technique which enables many subscribers to share a television transmission channel. This technique will largely increase the capability of conventional CATV systems. Two kinds of new services, i.e., still-picture information retrieval and still-picture two-way communication between subscribers, have been successfully tested with a model system located at the Suzuka Telecommunication Training School, Nippon Telegraph and TelePhone Public Corporation. Brief explanation is also given about still-picture information retrieval system using a polling method which is currently under development."
"Communication systems have become a fundamental utility for many facets of private and public life. Increasing system capabilities and advances in technology stimulate expectations of the public for new telecommunication services. Quite a variety of new services have been proposed which will have to be analyzed as to their utility, customer acceptance, and feasibility of implementation. In this paper an analytical approach is selected to assess these services by defining their communication structure and arranging them into classes corresponding to information flow, mode of information exchange, and communication pattern. Services requiring considerable technical expenditures and having a significant impact on future network configurations are pointed out. These services reqmre subscriber-individual and broad-band communication channels. For selected classes of services, a conceptual implementation in three types of networks is presented. It is recommended that several new services be implemented by using facilities of the existing public telecommunication network."
"Current studies are being undertaken by the United Kingdom Post Office to exploit more fully, in the shorter term future, and to rationalize, in the longer term, the local system of telecommunications distribution in the United Kingdom in order to offer a wider range of services to the customer. One proposal for a future integrated system utilizes a single wide-band medium to provide, in a cabinet area, groups of topological ring distribution highways on which all local traffic is assembled and switched. A laboratory model has successfully demonstrated engineering feasibility. Further studies are currently aimed at the determination of a viable technological progression toward an ultimately fully comprehensive telecommunition service."
"This paper describes a questionnaire-type survey conducted in 1970 of the nature, size, and composition of the likely market for broad-band two-way services to the home. Market demand characteristics are considered in detail for thirty likely services. The composite magnitude of the industry is estimated as essentially starting in 1980 and building up to a dollar volume of $20 billion per year."
"Four years have passed since the survey was conducted leading to the preceding paper [1]. Little work has been done, and even less progress has been made toward the goal of the new system developments. The present paper explores impediments that the writer believes are presently blocking the development of the potential broad-band cable interactive services industry. The key issues present are identified and a statement of the missing elements is provided. The paper concludes that broad-band cable information services to the home can be turned into reality even as early as the late 1970's or the mid 1980's. The writer suggests that governmental intervention may be required, primarily in standard's development, since present developments appear to be proceeding along dead-end trajectories. And, unless corrective action is taken we could easily inadvertently delay by many years the date when two-way services are able to pay their own way and thus be economically viable. Doing without also has its price. Society pays a high, although intangible, penalty in not having early access to a highly social, useful system until a much later date than technology and long-range economics would dictate."
 "This paper surveys present municipal communications, the potential for interactive modes in municipal communication systems, and some illustrative applications of the new cable systems for governmental and public service communications. Constraints which will inhibit some applications in the near future are summarized. Many diverse and competing interests will interact in the evolution of the new cable systems and the development of plans for controlling their operation. It is not assured that the public interest will be adequately represented or well served in this process."
"The noise power spectral density and sinusoidal response at the output of analog coaxial cable lines having amplifiers with frequency-dependent nonlinear characteristics are derived. Their use for the design and optimization of coaxial cable systems for TV transmission is demonstrated. Tables are given from which the levels of the intermodulation products for conventional 12- and 30-channel video systems can be readily obtained."
"The congestion in broad-band communications networks resulting from the increased demand for interactive services is considered. It is shown that services such as a video library could not be provided to the majority of subscribers in a conventional CATV network. A design is developed for a space division multiplex broad-band network which can be expanded at minimum cost to meet an increasing demand for interactive services. The network contains two signal distribution networks: a cablecast system similar to the Rediffusion system, and a switched communication network providing point-to-point circuits for both one-way and two-way services. All broad-band signals are transmitted to the subscribers in the 1- to 10-MHz spectrum, permitting the use of twisted pair video cables and a minimum number of cable amplifiers. The broad-band cable network (BCN) is organized around 15 local switching exchanges and one central exchange. Multipoint switches in local exchanges under wired-logic circuit control connect individual subscriber communication lines to any channel. Crosspoint matrix switching groups in the local and central exchanges connect communication circuits in the broad-band communication network under programmed computer control. This network is accessed via links terminating on one channel of the multiposition switches. Per-subscriber costs are estimated to be 190 dollars for a cablecast system serving 3800 subscribers. Additional expenditures per subscriber of 40 dollars for fixed costs and 40 dollars for variable costs would provide interactive services. The range of interactive services provided would be extremely flexible, including both one-way video library service and point-to-point two-way communications."
"An integrated distribution system is proposed that provides switched video, data, and telephony on a single analog broadband facility, using the concept of demand assignment. A reduced capability broad-band distribution system, based on the same principles and using coaxial cable, can be implemented in the near term to provide only the switched video and interactive data capabilities. Cost estimates are presented for this reduced capability system that are almost an order of magnitude lower than was previously thought possible for low-usage receive-only switched video service. It is expected that telephony con be added economically to this reduced capability system, as digital switching of telephony becomes practical. A brief discussion of the implications of this system approach for optical fiber systems is also given."
"A system of harmonically related visual carriers has many advantages for transmission in broad-band cable systems. All intermodulation products fall \"zero-beat\" with desired carriers and their visible effect is therefore drastically reduced. Prudent control of the relative phase of these harmonic carriers allows reduction in the peak-to-peak amplitude of the superposed carriers with consequent reduction of distortion in the system amplifiers. The system has been used for more than a year to provide 14 000 subscribers with 21 channels of television service."
"The broad-band communications industry is small and fractionated (about 3100 cable television systems serving 8.5 million subscribers in the U.S.), but has a high potential for growth by offering a wide variety of communications services. If this large number of systems is to collectively provide nationwide services, performance and interconnection standards will be essential. In this paper we note relevant existing standards and examine highlights of ongoing standards-making activities."
"Urban development of cable, generally regarded as a prospective testbed of interactive cable services, has not started on the optimistic path many predicted when the current FCC cable regulations took effect in 1972. Cable growth, and industry emphasis, have been markedly within franchises rather than in new franchises recently. Economic rather than regulatory forces may have been largely responsible for this effect. This paper describes the factors in Federal regulatory policy that impinge on interactive cable systems and new service developments, including pay television, the first significant new service to emerge. Recommendations of the Cabinet Committee on Cable that are potentially significant for the development of new cable services, enhancement of rural broad-band services, and development of modern interactive systems are discussed. A few current programs compatible with the Committee's recommendations for Federal support in cable public service development are also indicated."
"The possible role of satellites in broad-band interactive communications networks is described primarily in terms of a long distance transmission facility interconnecting several such networks over a wide geographical area. Discussion of the interface between the cable and satellite facilities is presented as well as a review of current broad-band operational and experimental uses of satellites which might be applicable to future system design."
"Cable TV has developed in 26 years from a TV relaying service to areas without broadcast service into a broad-band telecommunication distribution service with two-way interactive potential. The expanded operations include variety program originations, special information services as well as special functions not necessarily intended for general public distribution. Two-way operations have established themselves technically and are now engaged in experiments of application and marketing. Regional networks of interconnected cable systems have appeared. Viewing habits are changing."
"Cable television (CATV) is developing in Europe in response to three primary demands: the improvement of over-over-the-air reception of both television and FM radio channels, the provision of increased program diversity through the reception of additional foreign and domestic signals, and the reduction of numerous unsightly antennas. Technical advantages that cable provides are the primary reason for its success in meeting these demands and will largely determine the direction of the industry's development in the future. An awareness of the technical application of CATV in Europe is therefore important and is the principal focus of this paper."
"Two different systems of cable television have been developed in the United Kingdom, the HF multipair method designed as an alternative means of reception for local transmitters and the conventional coaxial form as a community antenna for distant stations. Restrictive government regulation combined with very extensive coverage by transmitters has seriously affected the prospects for cable television in the near term future. Prospects for the future, apart from a few experiments, must wait on the deliberations of a Royal Commission, expected to take about three years. The prospects in other countries of the European Community are more hopeful, and there is a growing interest in networks based on the star concept instead of the usual trunk and branch. General agreement about the wide-band services to be provided or the methods to be employed appears to be far off."
"Pilot two-way CATV systems have been mounted in the United States largely to assess the marketability of various interactive services (e.g., subscriber response) and to assess technical problems over operating CATV systems. Such tests were at their peak in the early 1970's. Twelve systems which have been publicly tested are considered briefly. Three of these, the Theta-Com subscriber response system (SRS), the Coaxial Scientific Telecinema system, and the MITRE MITRIX system, are considered in some detail."
"The characteristics of media for future broad-band two-way urban communications are reviewed. The media discussed include existing paired telephone cables, modified paired cables for higher frequency use, coaxial cable, waveguide, optical fibers and microwave radio. The paper discusses basic physical and transmission properties as they relate to broad-band use in the urban environment. Emphasis is placed on the portion of the plant between the customer and the nearest central location such as a telephone central office building, because this portion of the plant is controlling both physically and economically. The paper includes a discussion of the relevant characteristics of the urban environment, since these will have a strong impact on the suitability of the various media."
 "After a general discussion of the desirabilities and possibilities of the realization of integrated cable networks for urban information transport in The Netherlands, a hub configuration is proposed for the so-called subscriber network and some cable types are discussed among which the twin-coax and the coax-quad appear as interesting solutions for the subscriber link. The following items are specifically dealt with: trends in urban information transport; national economy and privacy; digital transmission, ultimate bit rate; definition of the integrated network problem; design criteria for a subscriber network; twin-coax, quad-coax and the shielded symmetrical pair cable."
"The features and limitations of time- and frequencydivision miltiplexed (TDM and FDM) systems for providing interactive services on broad-band communication networks are considered. We find that TDM systems make efficient use of bandwidth for digital signal rates below 10 kbits/s while FDM systems are efficient for analog signals and digital signal rates above 1 kbit/s. Although TDM and FDM systems can employ static allocation in which fixed channels are assigned to subscribers, dynamic allocation increases the efficiency of bandwidth usage by an order of magnitude. A TDM interrupt scheme appears to be the most efficient way to identify requests and process control signals in a dynamic allocation system, but introduces a problem of interference between simultaneous signals (not present with a polling technique for request identification)."
"The computer-communications revolution is now at the point where local interactive subscribers will be presented with the opportunities for nationwide interconnection. New digital links, value added networks, specialized common carriers, and satellite links must be considered in the optimizations of these nationwide networks. The local distribution networks for the nationwide networks are in an experimental stage, with ring networks and CATV systems under consideration. A range of technical problems is described that must be faced in the implementation of the national and local networks, and some proposed techniques and solutions are evaluated."
"The technology of optical waveguide systems has developed rapidly over the past few years, and they now appear to offer vast new capabilities in urban communications. A review and a status report of this technology is given; glass fiber waveguides are discussed in some detail because they show considerable promise for interactive networks. Optical sources, detectors, and integrated optical circuits are discussed."

"Two experimental \"electronic town hall\" meetings were carried out to test the potential of cable television technology as a means of expanding democratic participation, particularly in populous, impersonal urban settings. On the basis of a statistical analysis of questionnaire responses, participants perceived the electronic town meetings as being, overall, highly enjoyable, an effective means of making a group decision, convenient to attend, and readily accessible to expression of individual views. Although the element of face-to-face interaction as well as the greater spontaneity of the \"in-person\" meeting were missed by many, these factors were not seen as serious drawbacks by most and, on a number of other evaluative dimensions including overall judgment, the electronic format was accorded preference over the face-to-face meeting by a majority of participants."

"In recent years, several phenomena have caused significant pressures on the traditional, centralized urban structure. These phenomena include urban sprawl, separation of business and residential areas and concomitant dependence on transportation, the absence of effective or widespread mass transit, and declining oil reserves with rising energy costs. These conditions have made decentralization more attractive to many large organizations currently located in the central business districts (CBD's) of major urban areas. The increasing availability of sophisticated communications and computer technologies may encourage the continued growth and future decentralization of \"information industries,\" thereby producing major urban changes. The telecommunicationsaugmented decentralization of a traditional, centralized organization to a diffused one with an intraorganizational telecommunications network is described. The key factors in this process are discussed: 1) the ability of new telecommunications and computer technologies to maintain or increase productivity for routine clerical and management functions, 2) their availability, and 3) their costs relative to urban transportation systems. Telecommunications-augmented decentralization can have significant impacts on transportation, telecommunications, labor, and land-use policies; specific areas of impact are discussed."
"The New Rural Society (NRS) Project is determining how communications technology can be used to improve living conditions in rural areas. An important part of this research is concerned with encouraging the creation of employment in such areas. In conjunction with this objective, NRS has conducted a series of experiments leading to the development and field test of a teleconferencing system which would help facilitate the decentralization of employment by providing an electronic alternative for face-to-face meetings. This phase of the research is described."
"The contents of this paper represent selected elements of a technology assessment, carried out by Arthur D. Little, Inc., for the National Science Foundation, of electronics funds transfer (EFT). After a brief placement of EFT into historical perspective, the paper describes what EFT is and what it does. Some EFT experiments and their results are discussed. A section on a spectrum of means by which EFT may be introduced is followed by the identification of some impacts that EFT might have on five areas of our society: the financial industry, privacy, loans and credit, security, and the family."
"We discuss the impact of an evolving cable television technology on educational practice. The possible performance levels of a broad-band cable system, the quality of televised instruction, and the demands televised instruction would place on cable capacity are outlined. Social factors affecting individual preference and institutional resistance to cable education are considered."
"The current status of video telephone technology is reviewed briefly, and the form of the video telephone of the future is projected. Likely impacts of these future devices are then described and assessed. The impacts considered are: influences on personal behavior; delivery of medical care; increased communication among the deaf; expanded educational opportunities; changes in the structure of organizations; limited substitution of communications for travel, short and long distance; economy of scale in transmission facilities; competition for investment capital; effect on balance of payments; and near outlooks in utility regulation."
"The major premise of this paper is that telecommunication services can play Important roles in rural development. The authors argue that the implementation of a telecommunication infrastructure should be a high priority for development planners. An analysis is presented of the application of telecommunication in rural economic development, sociopolitical organization, and the extension of basic social services. The authors cite examples of applications of two-way audio communication and conference-circuits for remote areas. The advantages of satellites for providing telecommunication services to rural settlements are presented, and communication policy options for developing regions are outlined."
"Adequate health-care facilities are seldom available to persons physically remote from population centers. One method of relieving part of the problem is to provide facilities for diagnosing medical problems remotely via some form of communications technology. With this in mind, an experiment was conducted to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of two-way communication systemscolor television, black-and-white television, and hands-free telephone-as an alternative to physical presence consultation. Our results indicate that the taken to complete the diagnostic consultation was essentially the same across all four modes. Furthermore, no significant differences were found among the three remote modes for accuracy of diagnosis and patient management effectiveness, and physical presence consultations were found superior only in discovering secondary medical problems. Nevertheless, the attitudes of both patients and doctors showed a preference for color television over black-and-white television over hands-free telephone."
"The network telephone and broadcast video communications that blanket the nation are being exploited broadly for social purposes. Continuing technical effort can help reduce the cost and increase the flexibility of existing systems, thus making them even more attractive for such applications as improving education, increasing productivity, and delivering health care. Advances in technology can provide new opportunities, and there are promising results from R&D in broad-band transmission, image sensing, and graphic displays. However, there is no need to wait for new technology to use discretionary telecommunications for new social purposes. The biggest task is organizing institutions and procedures to use existing telecommunications effectively. And the most important measure of success for a novel application is likely not to be an abstract cost/benefit calculation, but rather the vital market place evaluation of whether anyone wants to support an operational version of an experimental system."
"In this paper we discuss the question of whether telecommunication experts are also experts in communication. Reviewing their profile of interest and their formal theories we are led to a rather negative conclusion. Further analysis shows that the knowledge of communication is rather inadequate anyhow: a long list of open questions can be presented. To find out more about these areas we find ourselves involved in sociotechnical research which is quite different from the technical research to which we are accustomed. This is illustrated by listing a number of weak points in the sociotechnical problem formulation. These characteristics reduce the possibility for early spectacular achievements as we are acquainted with in technical studies. The writer is not completely pessimistic however; he believes that an improved understanding of sociotechnical problems may be achieved by a close cooperation between telecommunication specialists and those trained in the humanities and social sciences. Three different strategies are discerned: basic research, field trials, and field work. The writer expresses some preference for the second approach. In conclusion, a reaction is given to the possible objection against sociotechnical studies, namely that divergencies in personal opinion about man and society might hamper agreement on objectives and interpretation. The writer gives a few considerations which he thinks are of general acceptance and sufficient for a common base of action."
"If one examines the need for the recording of information, it will emerge that for some classes of information it is essential that it be recorded, whereas for others, it seems only a matter of convenience, convention, or habit. The implications of this statement are discussed in this paper with the aim of determining whether a need exists for changing the present technology of recording information on paper for the purpose of communication. It is suggested that the problems arising from the continued use of this technology seem to be significant and that techniques are readily available for the development of alternative solutions."
"There has never been any shortage of ideas in the communications industry, only a problem of which to choose and which to reject. Building upon the thesis that to the extent a current innovation replicates the effects that past great innovations had on their host societies, an assessment tool is developed to aid in the design and decision processes. Three characterizations and two constraints are developed from an analysis of past great innovations that form the basis of the analysis technique. It has been found that this methodology can provoke new insights into old situations."
"Information economics is a new system of economics, overriding the classical school of economics, and at the same time it is a future economics. Three basic concepts of economics constitute the framework of information economics. The first of them is the spirit of giobalism-the ideas of spaceship, quality of time, and coexistentialism. The second is information productivity. The development of computer and communication technologies has made posible mass production of objective-oriented, logical, normative information. The third is time value-a new view of values. By time value is meant the value that is created through objective-oriented utilization of free time at the disposal of human beings. Just as each new theory of economics has a new vision, information economics has a vision-Global Futualization Society as the society where a large variety of voluntary communities will flourish on a global scale at a time, and the individual will seek to realize self-actualization in each community."
"This paper first attempts to characterize information technology as a political resource. How and in what respect, for example, does information technology compare in nature and significance to energy and other industrial capacities? What are the key differences, from the standpoint of politics? The paper then goes on to identify and assess a few particular impacts this technology is having and is likely to have on the future of American politics and government. Problems dealt with include: the problem of a new class division between those who know how and those who know; the problem of new forms of participation and their effect on the old; the problems of privacy and secrecy; and the future role of education."
 "Communication services arise as a response to social needs, including personal interaction, collective behavior, learning and socialization, and organized communication. These are met by an increasingly varied range of biosocial and man-machine processes. By the year 2000, it is possible that 20 or more such processes will be in widespread use. The planning and provision of services in response to demand involves a complex set of relationships between industrial production, occupational groups, governmental and nongovernmental service industries and regulatory bodies, primary social groups, and formal institutions. Models of these relationships may be called sociotechnical systems. They are particularly necessary to avoid crude technological determinism, which is present in much writing on the future of telecommunications and overstates the ability of mechanical devices to deal with social issues. The capacity of telecommunications to replace face-to-face interaction, to substitute for transportation, or to revolutionize education is not borne out by the evidence. Research on the social role of the telephone is now producing firmer evidence on which to base policy decisions."
"This paper is a review of research and applications on the subject of telecommunications as a substitute for travel over the last few years. With the increased emphasis on methods to conserve energy, a great deal of attention has been put on increasing the use of telecommunications. A summary is made of those modes of travel that are susceptible to substitution followed by a description of selected applications in the United States. A critical evaluation is made of the social and economic impacts or lack thereof. Finally areas requiring further research before widespread use of telecommunications as a substitute for travel can become a reality are discussed."
"This paper describes a laboratory facility and the multidisciplinary research that has been carried out in it relevant to the application of communications technology in such areas as teleconferencing and education. This facility at Carelton University, Ottawa, Canada, provides multichannel multipoint audio and video communications, and information storage and control facilities to simulate a wide variety of uses. The research program, conducted by communication technologists, systems engineers, and social psychologists, is outlined and the results of a number of teleconferencing and educational experiments are presented. The forthcoming communications technology satellite (CTS) Stanford-Carleton Universities Curriculum-Sharing Experiment is described, as are the preparations for a project in the educational applications of communications technology."
"This paper discusses some of the changes that might take place in this nation's health care system with the advent of national health insurance. These changes include structural reforms, planning and regulation, and the introduction of quality assurance mechanisms. The paper argues that a health care system will evolve that is both aggregated and regulated; and it foresees that computer and communication technologies will play significant roles in this evolution. The paper concludes by discussing some potentially harmful social consequences of these developments."
"In June 1971, the Committee on Telecommunications, National Academy of Engineering produced a report \"Communications Technology for Urban Improvement\" containing some twenty specific ideas on the use of telecommunications-information technologies to improve living conditions in U. S. cities. The suggestions covered such urban applications as citizen-local government interaction, education, health care, environmental monitoring, transportation, citizen safety, and emergency services. In the several years that have elapsed since the Committee's report was published, an encouraging number of the suggestions are being implemented or planned experimentally. A relative lack of market aggregation, and other problems attendant on experiments involving cities has resulted in the Federal Government being the principal fundor of experiments. The Committee on Telecommunications is now carrying out studies in the following areas: 1) the planning of the viable metropolitan communications system of the future; 2) reviewing for the Department of Housing and Urban Development its ongoing experiment on the development of information systems to serve city needs, and 3) studying for the U. S. Postal Service the latter's long term, i.e., 10 to 15 year, needs for electronic message distribution systems."
"Advances in the technology and organization of telecommunication systems now taking place in the United Kingdom, in common with other highly industrialized countries, will significantly affect the future of telecommunications. Typical of these are new and large information handling capacity transmission media of very wide bandwidth such as waveguides and optical fibers exploiting pulsecode modulation (PCM) digital techniques, computer controlled switching systems using digital time-division switches, large-scale integrated (LSI) circuits, high-capacity and fast access memory devices, and new types of solid-state visual display and image sensing devices. These technological advances will not only contribute to the growth and improvement of telephone service, they will also make possible and economic a number of new telecommunication services such as fast data and facsimile transmission (including an electronic mail delivery service), conference television, videophones, and visual display (data access) information services. They could also enhance the range of entertainment sound and television services available in the home, and provide audio/visual services for education and community purposes via broad-band local distribution networks. These technological and system advances may well have significant social implications. Although the rate at which demand for the new services will develop is uncertain, the falling cost of electronics, the rising cost of energy, time and physical transport, the increasing size of the information handling sector of the economy, and the increasing share of business and household expenditure being devoted to communications, all point to an important long-term future for the new services. Whilst the operations of a telecommunications administration need to be based on economic market demand, there may well be significant social considerations with regard to some sections of the community, e.g., the poor, the handicapped, and the old, that must also be taken into account. Also relevant and needing further study is the extent to which enhanced telecommunications can provide an acceptable substitute for existing media such as newspapers, the letter mail, and face-to-face meetings between people. The costs of such substitution are often difficult to determine in a meaningful way, nevertheless situations may arise where social reasons such as the need to improve the environment by reducing the need for business motivated travel and by facilitating the dispersal of industry may override narrow economic considerations. There is an interesting contrast between European countries such as the United Kingdom with a state-owned telecommunications monopoly where the integration of services into a common system may be more readily achievable, and the United States where antitrust legislation has developed a fragmentation of the telecommunication service industry. The United States environment generates a strong stimulus to innovation, whereas the European environment may enable innovation to be more effectively exploited. Of critical importance are the governmental regulatory processes by which an optimization of enhanced telecommunications from the economic, social, environmental, and commerical viewpoints may be achieved."
"The study reported here undertakes an exploratory inquiry into the potential use of selected emergent telecommunication channels for communication between congressmen and their constituents. The potential and limitations of each channel are identified through interviews with a stratified judgment sample of U. S. Representatives and senior staff from the 93rd Congress. The interview data then form the basis for an assessment of the political and public policy implications of using emergent channels for congressional-constituent telecommunication. Three channels-cable television, information retrieval, and the videoconference-are perceived by more than half of the congressmen and staff as being potentially useful for constituent communication. Possible adverse effects or serious limitations are also identified, especially for cable TV polling and the videophone. The study concludes that priority should be given to research and pilot studies on those configurations where the potential public benefits appear to far outweigh the possible public costs or risks, such as with legislative telecasting and the community information center. Given further research along with public education and the appropriate public policy decisions, emergent channels appear on balance to offer at least some realistic hope for improving democratic political processes."
"This paper forecasts a wide range of economic, social, political, legal, and institutional changes that will occur in the next several decades when interactive television is widely applied throughout society. A time-budget analysis is included which projects in quantitative terms how interactive television will alter the amounts of time that citizens devote to various work, home, and leisure activities."
"Changes are occurring in the traditional philosophy and organization of public utilities to cope with planning for increasing social complexity, and to accommodate growing community aspirations for an active voice in decision making. The concept of open planning, with community participation, is examined against a range of decision areas relevant to telecommunications development. Some models for participation are discussed along with practical constraints, problems, and likely benefits of open planning."

"This concise paper reports the result of a study on a multiplexing scheme for digital data transmission and switching which can handle both anisochronous and isochronous data traffic of various mix, mainly in one digital channel of PCM primary multiplex level (e.g., 1544 kbits/s) and corresponding time-division switch (TDSW) of data-switching equipment. The study aims to determine a unified scheme which is economical and flexible for intercity heavy-traffic data links, to accommodate a wide range of data speeds. The paper describes various multiplexing schemes and analyzes their features in terms of frame structure, synchronization time, error-correction capability, compatibility with signaling, hardware complexity, etc. A bit-interleaved multiplexing scheme is chosen as suitable and is applied in a laboratory model of a digital data switching system, the DDX-1 System."
"For communications satellites carrying a phase-shift keying (PSK) modulated carrier in one transponder and FM carriers in neighboring transponders, there is a potential adjacent interference effect from the PSK carrier into the FM carriers. In this correspondence the noise-power ratio (NPR) degradation is calculated for the top voice channels of the FM carriers as a function of the time-division multiple-access (TDMA) transponder single-carrier saturated equivalent isotropic radiated power (eirp), the TDMA transponder output filter selectivity, and the FM carrier sizes, Calculations are performed for the specific parameters of the INTELSAT IV system and compared with laboratory measurements. However the results are easily extendable to other communications satellite systems."
"Distributions of delay spread and correlation bandwidth at 0.9 and 0.5 correlation for Gaussian wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (GWSSUS) channels associated with 100 small-scale areas at different locations within a 2 × 2.5 km region of New York City are presented. For delay spread the maximum value observed was3\\frac{1}{2};\\mus and l0 percent of the areas exceeded2\\frac{1}{2}\\mus; for correlation bandwidth at 0.9 correlation the minimum was 20 kHz and 10 percent of the areas were less than 30 kHz; for correlation bandwidth at 0.5 correlation the minimum was 55 kHz and 10 percent of the areas were less than 130 kHz. The region is representative of the heavily built-up areas of many large cities in the United States."
"Methods are presented for the transmission of wideband digital signals above and below the frequency division multiplexing (FDM) baseband spectrum of analog microwave systems. In particular, it is shown that a Data Above Voice (DAV) system employing a 1.544 Mbit/s data channel above FDM channels and a Data Under Voice (DUV) system employing 1.544 Mbit/s channel below 720 FDM channels, are practical hybrid systems. Theoretical models of hybrid transmission are disucssed and the DAV/DUV methods are compared. A conceptual hybrid system design procedure is introduced and field measurement results on an 8 hop 6 GHz system are presented, comparing favorably with theoretical predictions."
"A new procedure is presented for testing the stability of lumped, linear, active, time-invariant two-ports. The mare advantage of this procedure is that it can consider conditional stability when the passive terminating impedances are limited to only a small subset of all passive impedances represented by the entire right half of the complex plane (RHP). The method can be easily computerized. It is especially useful when only the numerical values of the two-port parameters at various frequencies are known. One version of such a computer program is currently in use at Bell Laboratories for studying the stability properties of two-wire voice-frequency telephone circuits containing E6 type repeaters."
"A popular method of time-varying quantization involves a multlplicative change in quantizer overload point after each sample time. Although this technique produces an average loading factor that is invariant with rms input, it is vulnerable to transmission errors. Here, we introduce a related quantizer which has the advantage of disipating the effects of transmission errors at any desired rate. On the other hand, adaptation is not perfect. The loading factor now depends on rms input and in designing the quantizer one must compromise between the goal of constant loading factor and the goal of rapid error dissipation. We provide a design method and apply it to the modification of a quantizer currently used for speech. The new quantizer dissipates transmission errors with a 5 ms time constant while maintaining accurate adaptation over a 40 dB input range."
"The problem of continuously recovering timing phase and frequency in a high-rate carrier-modulated data communication device is addressed. The communication link is assumed narrowband with respect to the baud rate of the device, thus necessitating the use of some type of equalization in the receiver. The receiver demodulator is assumed coherent in nature. A timing recovery technique based on narrow-band filtering and squaring of the received demodulated waveform(s) is examined. Analysis of the first moment of the waveforms so generated reveals a convenient indicator of sampling instants. If the timing recovery filters are properly designed, then these sampling instants exactly satisfy a requirement previously derived, ensuring efficient operation of the equalizer. Design criteria for the filters are given. Two principal types of linear modulation techniques are considered. These are quardrature-carrier amplitude modulation (QAM) and staggered QAM (SQAM). A set of experimental waveforms observed in a QAM modem signaling at 2400 Bd is included for illustration. Several conclusions are drawn as a result of the study. First, the mean timing waveforms in QAM and SQAM systems bear fixed time relationships to suitable receiver sampling instants. Second, adequate timing filter design is attained with very narrowband filters centered on frequencies equal to half the baud rate and the full baud rate. Third, recovery circuits used in QAM systems may be designed so as to have negligible timing jitter. In SQAM systems and, consequently, in vestigial sideband-amplitude modulation (VSB-AM) systems, this advantage is generally not found."
"This paper finds an expression for the spectral density of an error-correcting coded digital sequence after modulation. This expression is valid for dependent source words and error-correcting linear block codes. Several examples are given of the ratio of the spectral density of the coded sequence to an uncoded sequence with identical source word rates for both independent and dependent source words."
"An experimental investigation has been performed to assess the feasibility of 8-phase phase-shift-keyed (PSK) signal transmission through a 6-GHz band microwave radio link with a 30-MHz nominal RF bandwidth. Only a portion of this bandwidth is currently being utilized to transmit one analog TV program or 1800channel frequency-division-multiplexed (FDM)/FM telephony. The link has been modified to have a 40-MHz bandwidth for this experiment. The digital modem is a 36-MHz bandwidth, 8-phase coherent PSK (CPSK), 36-Msymbol/s (108 Mbit/s) system. The work which has been performed includes the following: 1) study of the link bit error rate as a function of link carrier-carrier-to-noise ratio(C/N)with the transmitter TWT power output as a parameter; 2) study of the effects of an adjacent 1800-channel carrier (center-to-center separation of 36 MHz) on the error rate of the PSK carrier; and 3) perturbation of the 1800-channel FM carrier top channel noise power ratio (NPR) by an adjacent-channel 8-phase carrier (center-to-center separation of 36 MHz). In addition, experiments have been conducted through a four hop test simulator to examine the cumulative effect of transmission deviations such as group delay and TWT AM-PM transfer effect on the error rate performance for two different TWT power outputs, namely 2 and 4 W."
"The problem of quantization has been thoroughly studied for random processes. The usual criterion is to minimize the mean square error. Because of the eye's characteristics, this does not lead to the least number of bits. In this concise paper the results of experiments on gray scales and on quantized pictures are presented which lead to the choice of a compressor with a subjectively optimal parameter in the class of logarithmic compressors. Comparisons are made between the minimum mean square error quantizers on luminance signals, the usual quantizer for television signals (linear quantizer after a gamma correction) and the proposed quantization scheme designed for real visual scenes."
"A new model for predicting the computational performance of a sequential decoder operating in a noisy carrier reference environment is described. The major difference between this model and previous models is that the new model characterizes the number of computations per frame as the sum of the computations resulting from a number of independent searches. This number of independent searches can then be considered as an effective frame length. When this computational model is averaged over noisy reference phase errors using a medium-rate interpolation scheme, the results are found to agree quite favorably with experimental measurements."
"The analysis of the performance of a delta modulator with a Wiener process input is considered. The mean and the variance of the steady-state squared error are derived. In addition, the mean of the steady-state error of order four is calculated. It is shown that the behavior of all these moments as functions of the step size Δ and the sampling intervalTis similar: for each fixed Δ, the moments are monotonically increasing inT. More important, for each fixedT, there exists an optimal step size Δoptwhich minimizes each of these moments. It is shown that Δoptis a multiple ofT^{1/2}and that the corresponding minimum value of the moments is a multiple of eitherTor T2, depending on the order of the moment."
 "Correlation criteria have previously been established for identifying whether a given binary sequence would be a good frame sync word for phase-shift keyed telemetry. In the past, the search for a goodK-bit sync word has involved the application of these criteria to the entire set of 2KbinaryK-tuples. It is shown that restricting this search to a much smaller subset consisting ofK-bit prefixes of pseudonoise sequences results in sync words of comparable quality, with greatly reduced computer search times for larger values ofK. As an example, this procedure is used to find good sync words of length 16-63; from a storage viewpoint, each of these sequences can be generated by a 5- or 6-bit linear feedback shift register."
"The error probability performance ofM-ary noncoherent frequency-shift-keying (NCFSK) digital systems when under the influence of continuous wave (CW) interference is determined. Exact expressions are derived in terms of the signal-to-noise and the signal-to-interference ratios. Numerical results are given for quarternary and octonary NCFSK with the signal-signal-to-interference ratio as a parameter."
"The best signal and worst jamming are derived for a detection system which uses a matched-filter receiver. The penalty for deviation from the best signal is determined."
"A new algorithm for routing data packets in networks of computers connected by communication links is given. It is shown that considerable savings in required storage capacity can be obtained by adopting the proposed algorithm as compared to earlier known algorithms."
"The origin of the various types of delay and their meaning in communications is briefly discussed. Signal delay is defined by means of a cross correlation function which also serves as the conditional equation. The derivation of signal delay, which is to be understood as a generalized phase delay, becomes possible by splitting the delay into two additive contributions. One of them can be understood as a generalized group delay, the other is attributable to \"intercept distortion\" and can often be neglected."
"The expansion in the use of land mobile communications have led to a state of congestion in that portion of the radio spectrum allocated to the land mobile service. Digital communication is one of the methods that can be applied to improve spectrum utilization. In a typical digital communication system, messages are not queued and all overlapped messages have to be retransmitted. That overlapping phenomenon has a negative impact on the performance of the system. The behavior of various determinants of system performance (like probability distribution of waiting time and the load that saturates the channel capacity) are studied in detail. A simulation model was developed to simulate four basic design approaches. It was found that a combination of randomizer (for automatic retransmission) and an inhibit signal has no significant payoff and that each one of these features is superior to a commonly used method of automatic retransmission with constant delay. The relative merits of each design is studied as a function of the load on the channel."
"This concise paper presents a new network approach to delay minimization in a synchronous network. The delay minimization is achieved by controlling the demultiplexing frame with respect to the incoming frame in a master frame system."
"The paper begins with a description of an experimental earth station especially designed for moon-reflection communication purposes. This is followed by a description of the experimental results of the characteristics of the moon-reflected signals obtained at an operating frequency in the lowerXband. The received signal envelope was found to fade within wide limits and the fading rate was dependent on the libration rate of the moon. The maximum rms frequency in the frequency spectrum of the envelope was estimated to be on the order of 60 Hz, giving an approximate measure of the frequency spreading due to the libration of the moon. The statistical analysis of the echo envelope has also been carried out and it was found to follow the Rayleigh distribution. Our results imply that atXband a discrete coherent reflector does not seem to be present and consequently, the moon may be regarded as a reflector composed of a large number of scatterers distributed over its surface."
"This concise paper points out evidence that in many cases the fluctuations in a signal transmitted through ionospheric irregularities do not obey Rician statistics and that therefore, the Rician relation between the specular-to-interference ratio and the scintillation index, recently discussed by Shaft, may not apply to ionospheric communications studies in these cases."
"The coupling loss between a coaxial cable with a circumferential gap and a dipole antenna is analyzed. The numerical results have application to continuous-access guided communication (CAGC) and to related leaky feeder systems now being used in intramine communications. It is shown that the coupling is very strong in the neighborhood of the cable axis even when the linear distance between the dipole and the cable gap is large. This, of course, is a desirable feature of such limited-access communication systems."
"A Gauss quadrature rule (GQR) is used to develop an efficient series representation of a band-limited Gaussian process. This representation allows one to analyze the performance of an incoherent frequency-shift keyed (FSK) system under the influence of an additive Gaussian noise. This system consists of two parallel filters followed by two squarers, with the sum of their outputs fed to an integrate-and-dump detector. Numerical results are presented for some cases of practical interest."
"A single-frequency radio net system having two-level preemptive priority is analyzed in the steady state. Negative exponential traffic statistics are assumed and unlimited queue length allowed. Closed-form solutions are obtained for a number of performance measures which characterize the operation from the system, and station points of view."
"LINC is a technique that uses signal processing to produce linear amplification of bandpass signals with grossly nonlinear circuit components. Two important signal-processing functions of LINC are 1) forming two constant envelope phase-modulated signal components from the bandpass input signal and 2) recombining the amplified components to produce an amplified replica of the input signal. Two-tone laboratory tests of a LINC component separator and combiner, not including a limiter and envelope detector, show that, at full output, spurious levels 40 dB below tone level are achievable over a 1-MHz band. Because the laboratory model operated at relatively low frequencies (hundreds of megahertz), scaling up in frequency should result in a LINC with <40-dB spurious over a 10-MHz band. Spurious 30 dB below tone level should be achievable over a bandwidth of 50 to 100 MHz using the same technique of component signal separation. Lower spurious levels or greater bandwidths will require a sin-1phase modulator that is less sensitive to delay in a feedback loop."
"Multiplication is an essential operation in digital signalprocessing algorithms. In such applications the organization of a multiplier typically ranges from parallel array to serial-parallel pipeline, with many intermediate possibilities. In this concise paper, the parallel array and serial-parallel pipeline organizations are compared on the basis of the power dissipation needed to achieve a specified multiplication rate. The first-order comparison is intended to serve as a preliminary aid in the design of custom integrated multiplier circuits. The comparison illuminates the differences in circuit technology appropriate for the two organizations. It also indicates that, insofar as custom integrated circuit design is concerned, design parameters other than power dissipation are likely to be the dominant considerations in choosing a multiplier organization."
"The performance of a noncoherent frequency-shift keying (FSK) system employing postdetection filtering is determined. The FSK pulses are allowed to be amplitude modulated (AM-FSK) and the postdetection filter is allowed to be arbitrary. The analysis for the general case will be shown to simplify the previously known results when the AM is removed and the postdetection filter is an integrate-and-dump. The numerical results will take into account the effects of intersymbol interference. Both computer simulation results and experimental results will be presented and will be shown to agree quite closely with the analysis."
"Except for rectangular-shaped modulating pulses, the specification of the power spectral density function (psdf) for digital FM is analytically perverse and only a few results are available in the journal literature. In this paper an analysis is presented based on the selection of an appropriate duration-limited/level-quantized approximation for the modulating pulses and equations suitable for machine computation are subsequently developed. Examples of interest are selected from the areas of binary FM, binary correlative FM, and quaternary correlative FM with the results presented in graphical form"
"This concise paper explores some of the boundaries in performance of slotted ALOHA systems by analyzing a simple and almost optimal centrally supervised control. Our control results in a very simple Markov chain model and allows an examination of stability, conditional waiting time distribution of transmitting terminals, and many other system measures. The key to the simplicity is to have a probability of successful packet transmission that is independent of the number of transmitting terminals. Regarding stability, recent papers have shown that a slotted ALOHA system with an infinite population of terminals producing packets at a Poisson rate λ/slot becomes saturated with retransmissions and breaks down. Here we define a stable ALOHA system as one that clears out the blocked packets in a finite time, and has only a finite number of blocked packets in the system, all with arbitrarily low probability. This is a necessary condition for previous definitions of stability to be meaningful. In considering waiting time, we calculate the mean and other moments of the waiting time of a terminal when it enters the system to find (n - 1) other terminals already there competing for the channel. Under this control, the average time is proportional ton. Two things should be pointed out. The first is that the control requires exact knowledge of the number of terminals contending for the channel, and hence is not implementable, except as an approximation. The second is that the analysis takes into account the dynamic comings and goings of terminals."
"A receiver structure is described, for use in pulseamplitude modulation (PAM) data communication systems, which combines null-zone detection and maximum likelihood (ML) processing to improve upon the performance of a conventional decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) while retaining a manageable level of complexity. If the output of the equalizer does not fall in the null zone, the receiver operates as a conventional DFE; however, when the equalizer output falls in the null zone, the decision on that data symbol is deferred one sampling instant and the two most likely signal levels are fed back into the equalizer, generating two competing outputs at the next sampling instant. Applying ML bit detection to this pair of outputs, and optimizing the width of the null zone, improves the effective signal-to-noise ratio of the receiver. Deferring the bit decision beyond one bit interval permits the utilization of additional received samples, and this extended receiver further increases the effective signal-to-noise ratio. The penalty paid for using a null zone, as opposed to performing ML detection on each bit, is at least a 3 dB loss of the usable (by a Viterbi algorithm (VA) receiver) energy contained in the interfering pulse samples."
"Harashima and Miyakawa [1] and Tomlinson [2] have described a generalized partial response technique which achieves the performance of the decision-feedback equalizer without the error propagation problem. We show here that when the equalized and baud-rate sampled channel assumes the special rationalztransformF(Z) =\\frac{\\sum\\min{i=0}\\max{M}{g_{i}Z^{i}}{1/L\\sum\\min{i=0}\\max{N}{l_{i}Z^{i}wherel_{0} = L, g_{0} = 1, thegiandliare integers, andLis a power of 2, the implementation can assume an especially simple form not requiring the storage of analog samples. The numerator polynomial can be chosen to achieve transmission zeros, as in ordinary partial response, while the denominator can be chosen to reduce the noise enhancement in equalization. This technique results in as much as a doubling of the peak transmitted voltage and, as in ordinary partial response, an increase in the number of received levels. It is shown that on thef^{1/2}channel characteristic of coaxial cable, most of the noise advantage of decision-feedback equalization can be achieved with a moderate number of received levels, and that some of this noise advantage can be traded for a reduced number of received levels. The greatest advantage accrues in multilevel transmission because of the lower peak transmitted voltage penalty."
"A frequency domain analysis of the digital generation of linearly modulated data waveforms is presented. It is shown that for any rational relation of line carrier frequency and digit frequency, digital data transmitters can be designed economically and adapted to large scale integration (LSI) techniques. Special attention is given to the elimination of digital multipliers throughout the system. The results are illustrated with an example of an all-digital vestigialsideband (VSB) transmitter, with a specially shaped output spectrum which facilitates carrier and clock recovery in the receiver."
"A Markov gap model is proposed for real digital communication channels. Analytic properties of the model are investigated and compared with data from VHF and troposcatter channels. The model is also simulated, and the satistics of the simulated data are compared favorably with those of the real data."
"A discrete phase state bit-synchronization loop is proposed for synchronization and detection of a binary nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) process. The general loop model is developed for 11 and 17 phase states with optional sequential loop filter. Loop performance is considered in terms of the phase error density function, rms phase error, and mean time to bit slippage. It is shown that satisfactory loop performance can be achieved at -3 dB SNR through use of sequential loop filters."
"This presents a summary of the results of measurements of through-the-earth attenuation to received LF and VLF signals at one site. The loss represents, on a communication link basis, the excess loss incurred by Placing the receiving antenna underground instead of above the earth's surface. The results of this test indicate underground receiving antennas are practical at these frequencies."

"This paper discusses the problem of congestion in message-switched data communication networks. This condition occurs when more traffic enters a network than can reasonably be served. Two types of techniques employed to control congestion in already existing national networks are identified. A queueing model which can be used to analyze and compare these control schemes for a simple tandem link network is developed. Finally, analytic results are presented which describe the behavior of the simple network using the two control schemes, and which should be useful in the design of more general networks as well."
"In this paper we examine the problem of optimum demodulation of a class of pulse modulation schemes that employ Secondary frequency modulation-frequently used in satellite data transmission and remote control systems. We develop approximate zero-lag and finite-lag receivers using approximate nonlinear filtering and smoothing techniques and study their steady-state behavior for various pulse modulation schemes. Comparisons of performance are also presented, between the zero-lag and finite-lag receivers on the one hand and between various primary modulation schemes on the other."
"In communication engineering the problem of synchronization is important and is usually achieved by use of a phase-locked loop. If for any reason synchronization is lost, then it is not only necessary that it be restored but it be done so in the shortest possible time. This correspondence considers precisely this problem. It has been shown recently [2, pp. 253-259] that in case the loop filterGis ideal low-pass, the optimum nonlinear feedback controller that achieves synchronization in the shortest possible time is an on-off device. This correspondence considers the filterGto be nonideal and assumes that it is described by a differential equation of arbitrary order. For the class of admissible feedback controllers this correspondence considers polynomials of arbitrary but finite degree with coefficients chosen from a closed bounded subset of an Euclidean space of dimension equal to the degree of the polynomials. It is shown here that the optimal feedback controller is a polynomial of the highest degree admissible with coefficient-vector taking values at one of the vertices of the cube. The result is illustrated by a numerical example involving a second-order filter."
"A Percival coil connected between the photodetector and amplifier in the receiver of a digital optical communication system offers the possibility of a reduced signal power requirement for a given bit error rate. When the photodetector is an avalanche diode, the modified receiver requires a lower value of avalanche gain for optimum performance."
"This paper describes a real-time computer implementaation of a fourth-order adaptive predictive coder (APC) which transmits speech at 6400 bits/s. To reduce the demands on the central processor, the terminal uses the average magnitude difference function (AMDF) for pitch extraction and calculates the predictor coefficients and reflection coefficients assuming stationarity of the input data. With 16-bit fixed-point arithmetic processing, the coder achieves an intelligibility score of 87 percent on the diagnostic rhyme tests (DRT) and produces speech with acceptable voice naturalness even in the presence of acoustic background noise."
"The white block skipping (WBS) method of coding binary facsimile images consists of breaking each scan line intoNpicture-element (pel) blocks, then using \"0\" as the code word for all-white blocks and \"1\" followed by the binary pattern in the block for non-all-white blocks. In the first part of this paper, we derive (based on a first-order Markov source model) the optimum block sizeNand its corresponding minimum bit rate as functions of the average white and black run lengths of the image. In the second part of this paper, we propose a modified coding scheme where all-white scan lines are essentially skipped. This modified scheme is found to be as efficient as run length coding for transmitting texts."
"An interframe coding system is described which is capable of transmitting a 4-MHz National Television System Commission (NTSC) color television signal. 6.3 Mbit/s transmission gives acceptable picture quality for video telephone or conference TV use. The NTSC color television signal is converted into a timedivision multiplex (TDM) signal which is composed of time-compressed chrominance and luminance signal in sequence. This signal is encoded using a frame-difference coder of the kind that has been used for black-and-white television signals. A field-repeating technique is introduced into the coder, to prevent a buffer memory from overflowing and to improve picture quality. Statistical investigations show that the presence of the timecompressed chrominance signal gives less than 10 percent increase in the amount of information generated by picture movements; this increase scarcely affects the picture quality."
"In this paper we present a new vocoder called the residual-excited linear prediction (RELP) vocoder. The concept of the RELP vocoder combines the advantages of linear predictive coding (LPC) and voice-excited vocoding. In the RELP system, vocal tract modeling is done by the LPC technique, and the LPC residual signal is used as the excitation signal. After low-pass filtering the residual signal is coded by adaptive delta modulation and is spectrally flattened before being fed in the LPC synthesizer. The range of the transmission rate is typically between 6 and 9.6 kbits/s; the synthetic speech in this range is quite good. As the transmission rate is lowered, the synthetic speech quality degrades very gradually. Since no pitch extraction is required, the vocoder is robust in any operating environment."
"This paper briefly traces the development of physical subscriber loop design in the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) Program from 1949 to the present. Development of equipment for overcoming in the most economical manner the signaling and transmission problems encountered with long subscriber loops is also discussed. This includes loading systems for wider bandwidth, better structural return loss, less bridging effects with multiparty lines; loop extenders in place of costly long-line adapters (LLA's); lower cost voice-frequency repeaters (VFR's) and switching methods such as Common-Mode Operation (CMO) where less equipment is required. Discussion of the problems still encountered with transmission and signaling on rural subscriber loop is presented with ideas for solution. Development of VFR equipment with automatic gain control for use in CMO or Common-Control Central offices would permit designing to common circuit net loss and minimize contrast between circuits. Extension of signaling limits of central office equipment (COE) now being developed could eliminate the need for external loop extension equipment on better than 90 percent of rural subscriber loops. Development of a telephone instrument requiring less dc line current would eliminate the need for elevated line voltages."
"The time variations and harmonic content of longitudinal (common-mode) interference present on a wide variety of telephone lines in both urban/suburban and residential/rural environments have been measured. Significant levels of 60 Hz and its next 15 odd-harmonics were present. Variations with time ranged from an insignificant amount to over 20 dB. Interference trends relative to the size of the central office (CO), i.e., number of lines, were noted. In addition to showing noise trends with time, the results indicated desirable periods to record average noise conditions, times to record peak noise, and the important harmonics to measure. Such data are helpful to telephone company engineers in their cooperative efforts with power companies to isolate and correct interference problems. This coordination should result in greater compatibility between the operations of the two utilities. These data will also aid telephone designers to design equipment that will reduce the adverse noise effects of the telephone operating environment."
"This correspondence presents a simple bandwidthefficient rule for assigning carrier frequencies that ensures that all fundamental product terms up to a desired order fall on distinct frequencies, thereby facilitating their measurement."
"The effects of filter shaping and nonlinearity in a coherent quadrature phase-shift-keyed (QPSK) system are investigated. Optimization of the receiver filter with respect to the meansquare error (MSE) is considered. Optimization is performed under two different constraints, corresponding to implementation of the filter at intermediate frequency and baseband, respectively. As an example a channel with a typical traveling-wave tube (TWT) nonlinearity is studied. Numerical results are obtained which describe the effect of different transmitter filter characteristics on system performance."
"This paper reports upon the results of tests of the transmission of data over single- and multiple-hop companded delta modulation (DM) systems. The DM coder-decoder (CODEC) was optimized for voice transmission. Modem bit error rate (BER) achievable over the range of 1200-9600 bits/s is presented. A comparison with the performance of pulse code modulation (PCM) is included. The comparison indicates that the two systems are comparable for error-free digital lines but favors the DM system for lines with errors."
"A method for transmission of a 1.544-Mbit/s data channel in a frequency band which is above the baseband of sound and vision signals of color television in FM microwave systems is described. The impact of the interfering video signal on phaseshift keyed (PSK) performance is evaluated. The probability of error as a function of the receiver carrier-to-noise ratio in the data channel for the case of Gaussian noise, sinusoidal interference, and various video test waveform (color bar, stair step, etc.) interference and combinations of these is measured. Analog and also novel digital methods of insertion of the television sound subcarrier signal are described. Data above video (DAVID) transmission measurement results which have been performed on an RCA 6-GHz microwave hop are presented."
"A Percival coil connected between the photodetector and amplifier in the receiver of an optical communication system offers the possibility of improved signal-to-noise ratios (SNR's). When the photodetector is an avalanche diode, the modified receiver requires a lower value of avalanche gain for optimum performance."
"We consider a population of terminals communicating with a central station over a packet-switched multiple-access radio channel. The performance of carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) [1] used as a method for multiplexing these terminals is highly dependent on the ability of each terminal to sense the carrier of any other transmission on the channel. Many situations exist in which some terminals are \"hidden\" from each other (either because they are out-of-sight or out-of-range). In this paper we show that the existence of hidden terminals significantly degrades the performance of CSMA. Furthermore, we introduce and analyze the busy-tone multiple-access (BTMA) mode as a natural extension of CSMA to eliminate the hidden-terminal problem. Numerical results giving the bandwidth utilization and packet delays are shown, illustrating that BTMA with hidden terminals performs almost as well as CSMA without hidden terminals."
"Radio communication is considered as a method for providing remote terminal access to computers. Digital byte streams from each terminal are partitioned into packets (blocks) and transmitted in a burst mode over a shared radio channel. When many terminals operate in this fashion, transmissions may conflict with and destroy each other. A means for controlling this is for the terminal to sense the presence of other transmissions; this leads to a new method for multiplexing in a packet radio environment: carrier sense multiple access (CSMA). Two protocols are described for CSMA and their throughput-delay characteristics are given. These results show the large advantage CSMA provides as compared to the random ALOHA access modes."

"Ray position in slope-controlled waveguides is studied. A linear combination of three consecutive position measurements is used to calculate the slope error of the middle lens. This is the error input to the middle lens positioning system. Independent lens correction results and thus a decoupling of space and time response is achieved. The system is shown to be stable. Overshoot in the transient response due to cross coupling between controllers is eliminated. Performance is compared to that of the position-controlled waveguide. Computer simulations indicate that the system is stable in the presence of statistical parameter variations."
 "Using the recently developed probability density function we obtain \"directly\" the error rate expressions for the binary differential phase-shift keyed (DPSK) systems when the noise values at the sampling instants in adjacent time slots are statistically dependent. Two cases are considered: One corresponding to equal SNR at each of the two sampling instants, and the other to unequal SNR's. The consideration of the former case, together with the assumption of unequal a priori symbol probabilities P0and P1results in an error rate expressionP_{E} =1/2[1 + (P_{0} - P_{1})\\rho] \\exp (-h^{2})where ρ is the noise correlation coefficient, and h2is the SNR. This expression shows clearly why PEis independent of noise correlation when the source symbols are equi-probable provided intersymbol interference is assumed absent. We then obtain the error probability expression in terms of unequal SNR's (at the two sampling instants) and the correlation coefficient ρ. Since intersymbol interference in a binary DPSK system gives rise to unequal SNR's, this expression provides a useful formula for estimating the system performance under such circumstances."
"Ever since carrier was developed for trunk usage, carrier for subscriber use, either over wire or radio, has been considered as a means for providing telephone service in rural areas. Starting with the Bell System development of its\"M\"type power line carrier, there have been 34 years of progress and subscriber carrier is now a reality. It is now beginning to become widely accepted in the telephone industry. Every year improvements in the state of the art are made. There is little doubt today that more and more subscriber carrier on wire lines and radio will be used in future years. This concise paper includes the history of the development of subscriber carrier and radio in the Telephone Program of the Rural Electrification Administration (REA). Also, the authors attempt a prognosis of what will happen in the next ten years (or longer). Suggestions are made for improvements still deemed necessary in equipment of this type."
"This concise paper analyses the performance of noncoherentM-ary digital systems in presence of a generalized stationary Poisson impulsive noise process, with a receiver operating as a maximum likelihood detector in white Gaussian interference. Methods to bound the error probability for ASK, PSK, and FSK systems in the cases where the noise is impulsive and quasi-Gaussian are described and the results discussed."
"Automatic detection using correlation relies on a phaselocked loop for synchronization. If the loop contains an imperfect integrator, only a finite error frequency (pulse rate) can be tracked. This concise paper yields the transcendental equations (and some specific numerical results for a maximally flat loop response) that relate duty-cycle, loop-bandwidth, integrator imperfection, and pull-in frequency when the input is noiseless. Analysis is based on piecewise-linear methods which are exact, although solutions are found numerically. One exemplary result shows that for a duty cycle of 5 percent and an integrator pole(b)to loop zero(a)ratio of ofb/a = 0.005, the pull-in frequency is 1.05 times the undamped natural loop frequency."
"Tests were performed over a good communications grade single sideband (SSB) channel on the listenability of various types of music under frequency shift distortion up to ± 30 Hz. Sensitivity to this type of distortion depends upon the type of music, and frequency shift should be less than ± 5 Hz to avoid noticeable degradation."
"The precise tone system based on the four basic frequencies 350, 440, 480, and 620 Hz is extensively used in switching systems to indicate readiness to dial, ringing of the called subscriber, lines or trunks busy, and other conditions. In digital switching systems it is normally advantageous to generate and process these tones in a digital form. It is shown that by judicious selection of the tone frequencies, considerable simplification of digital tone generators may be achieved. Modification of the precise tone frequencies within ± 0.5 percent reduces the number of samples which must be stored in ROM's from 1650 to 326. Another set of frequencies is given which requires only 228 samples and simplifies the tone generator readout logic."
"A general expression is derived for the eye pattern boundaries of a multilevel class-4 partial-response (PR) signal after single-sideband amplitude-modulation (SSBAM) transmission with a carrier phase error. From the expression particular results are obtained for the horizontal and vertical eye openings of the signal. Expressions are derived for the tap settings of a linear transversal equalizer using the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion when the class-4 PR signal is distorted by a carrier phase error and sampled with timing error. The values of the tap settings can be used to reduce the carrier and timing phase errors. Finally, an expression for the vertical eye opening of the equalized signal is derived as a function of the carrier phase and the number of stages in the equalizer."
"This concise paper analyzes the transfer of amplitude modulation from one sinusoidal carrier to phase modulation of other carriers passing through the same memoryless nonlinear device. It gives exact expressions for the AM-PM transfer coefficient, which is one part of the mechanism that leads to intelligible crosstalk, and the expressions are valid for sinusoidal carriers in the presence of Gaussian noise through devices with known amplitude and phase characteristic. Two particular input signal combinations (two carriers with a given level difference, and a large number of small carriers) are considered in more detail, and the expressions are applied to a typical TWT characteristic."
"The best estimation of sampler timing in adaptively equalized systems is examined. First, two previous approaches to the estimation problem are reviewed and are found to have fundamental shortcomings. The first technique sets the timing instants coincident with the peak of the unequalized system impulse response. Under certain circumstances this technique can produce nulls in the spectrum of the sampled system, thus preventing efficient operation of the equalizer. The second technique sets the timing instants so as to minimize the residual distortion of the equalized system. This does assure proper operation but requires a second equalizer structure and also requires an accurate initial estimate of sampler phase which it cannot provide itself. A timing recovery technique based on band-edge component maximization which circumvents these problems is presented. Although the scheme is not optimal, it efficiently and effectively recovers timing in synchronous equalized data communication systems."
"This paper presents the development of repeaters and line equipment for an experimental digital long-haul transmission system using coaxial cable. A comparison, of different types of digital transmission systems indicates that the digital repeater hybrid system with binary transmission code is the most desirable. This development has resulted in digital pulse reshaping repeaters with very small dimensions, low cost, and good reliability. Both digital repeaters that are without timing and regenerators that include timing have been developed. Their circuitry and the corresponding signal shapes are described. The dc power-feeding system and the fault-location system are also discussed. An experimental field trial with the Deutsche Bundespost was performed over 10-repeater sections of the International Telephone and Telegraph Consultative Committee (CCITT) normal coaxial tube with a section length of 1/2 mi, The experiments confirmed that a long-haul digital transmission system of 560 Mbits/s, and later of 1100 Mbits/s using the described system concept and technology, can be established with relatively low cost and good reliability."
"A new algorithm is proposed for the digital implementation of theM-channel SSB-frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) modulator and demodulator, which is computationally attractive and inherently insensitive to parameter quantization."
"A simple method is presented and illustrated for the updating of maximum usable frequency (MUF) predictions for a given HF propagation path by employing real-time observations of the MUF's for a different path. A test of the method performed by utilizing experimental data for two pairs of paths indicates that the updating technique provides significant reductions in the prediction errors."
"The design of carrier phase and timing recovery methods for data transmission by means of simulation is described. Results are given for a partial response class 4 data signal transmitted by single-sideband amplitude modulation."
"A new method is presented which describes the behavior of an(N + 1)th-order tacking system in which the nonlinearity is either periodic [phase-locked loop (PLL) type] or a nonperiodic [delay-locked loop (DLL) type]. The cycle slipping of such systems is modeled by means of renewal Markov processes. A fundamental relation between the probability density function (pdf) of the single process and the renewal process is derived which holds in the transient as well as in the stationary state. Based on this relation it is shown that the stationary pdf, the mean time between two cycle slips, and the average number of cycles to the right (left) can be obtained by solving a single Fokker-Planck equation of the renewal process. The method is applied to the special case of a PLL and compared with the so-called periodic-extension (PE) approach. It is shown that the pdf obtained via the renewal-process approach can be reduced to agree with the PE solution for the first-order loop in the steady state only. The reasoning and its implications are discussed. In fact, it is shown that the approach based upon renewal-process theory yields more information about the system's behavior than does the PE solution."
"The problem of designing optimum receivers with a finite built-in delay, for a class of stochastic signals, is considered. The approach used here is based on the so-called fixed-lag smoothing techniques. Specific cases of amplitude and phase modulation are considered in detail to illustrate the type of optimal (suboptimal in the nonlinear case) receivers which are obtained using this approach. The performance of these finite-delay demodulators is compared with that obtainable using the ideal infinite-delay and the common zero-lag demodulators. It is found that introduction of a nominal delay results in a significant improvement in performance over the zero-lag demodulators, of course, at the cost of increased complexity."
"A set ofMequally-likely equal-energy transmittable signals is considered, each of which consists of a linear combination of tones fromDfree running oscillators(D \\leq M). The oscillator tones are assumed sufficiently disjoint to be orthogonal. The design problem consists of finding the optimal receiver and signal set for variousMandD. For the additive white Gaussian noise channel, the optimal receiver first forms the sufficient statistic which consists of noncoherently detecting the energy in each of theDtones. Unlike previous designs of digital transmitters based on minimization of the probability of error, when noncoherent oscillations are employed, the optimal receiver and signal set are dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio. The imposed constraints restrict the signal vectors to the all-positive subspace of the surface of aD-dimen sional sphere. The optimal receiver, signal set, and resulting prob ability of error and channel capacity are determined forM \\geq D = 2for low and high signal-to-noise ratios. Severe performance constraints imposed by using a suboptimal square-law receiver are discussed. Preliminary results have been obtained for the general caseM \\geq D > 2."
"This paper determines the intelligible crosstalk performance of analog multichannel subscriber carrier systems. Using a 0.1 percent probability of intelligible crosstalk objective, the calculations determine that the equal level far-end crosstalk loss must exceed 55.6 dB. Based on crosstalk measurements of in-service cables in South Central Bell, it is shown that only a small fraction of the pairs fail the crosstalk objective. Hence, it is concluded that multichannel analog subscriber carrier systems can be applied without any cable crosstalk constraints."
"A communication path (in isolation) in a packet-switching store-and-forward communication network, such as a computer or satellite-communication network, is considered. Messages are assumed to arrive according to a Poisson stream, and messagelengths are considered to be random variables governed by an arbitrary distribution. Message lengths are divided into fixed-length packets which are sent independently over theN-channel communication path in a store-and-forward manner, and are reassembled at the destination terminal. Expressions for the distributions of the message waiting and delay times over the path are derived. Also, we obtain the limiting average message waiting times and required buffer sizes at the individual channels. The overall message waiting time is observed to depend only on the minimal channel capacity. The case of exponentially distributed message lengths serves as an illustrating example."
"A digital filter is introduced consisting of a transversal part and a simple recursive network. The coefficients of the transversal part are equal to integer powers of two or zero; thus complicated multipliers are avoided and instead a simple routing circuit is used. Use of several types of the recursive network makes the filter applicable in different frequency ranges. The coefficients of the transversal part can be interpreted as differences of successive values of the impulse response of the filter. It is shown that this difference routing digital filter (DRDF) is especially suited for application in data transmission."

"Current practice for multichannel delta modulation (DM) terminals uses one DM codec per channel-end. This paper describes methods by which one high-speed DM codec can be timeshared over a large number of channels. The methods are also applied to multichannel differential PCM (DPCM) terminals. In both cases the time-shared codecs include step-size adaptation determined by the recent past history of the coded digital signal. A method for digital conversions between multichannel linear PCM and adaptive DPCM (ADPCM) formats is also described."
"In this concise paper we examine the signal design problem associated with a multiple access communication channel in which several binary digital links are operated simultaneously over a common channel. Receiver noise is neglected but the channel is confined in dimension, so that signal crosstalk is the only source of bit errors. An encoder is assumed to exist prior to channel transmission for converting the bit waveforms from all transmitters into a common channel signal available to all receivers. The encoder selects the channel signal during each bit so as to maximize the average detection probability per bit, where the average is taken over all links and all possible bit patterns. Two classes of receivers are considered. In the first the receivers are confined to only signal correlations with the corresponding transmitter signals. In the second the encoder and receivers are matched to arbitrary signal sets. For both type receivers, optimal channel signal selection is shown to be related to minimal hamming distance mappings. Values and bounds for the resulting detection probabilities in terms of numbers of transmitters and channel dimension are reported."
"Differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) performance analysis in the presence of multipath is extended to include cases in which the Doppler spread is on the order of the bit rate or greater. As the Doppler spread is increased from zero, the performance degrades below that predicted by Jones [1]. However, as the Doppler spread is increased beyond values on the order of the bit rate, performance improves. In the limit as the Doppler spread approaches infinity, with total multipath power held constant, performance approaches that of ideal DPSK as expected. Bit error rate performance in the presence of time-selective Rician fading is presented along with confirming experimental data obtained with a channel simulator."
"A two-dimensional interpolative model for coding of images is presented. It is shown that this model leads to three different coding algorithms, each algorithm defining a specific transmitter-receiver architecture. Simulation examples on a 255 × 255 image are given. Computational aspects and possible extensions are discussed."
"This paper presents a simple formula for the capacity of a coherent digital communication channel operating near threshold [i.e., with very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)] with additive noise from a certain class of arbitrary but known probability distributions. For the noncoherent threshold channel, the optimun receiver is derived for arbitrary modulations and fading. This receiver is shown to specialize to previously derived canonical froms for unmodulated signals."
"A series of experiments have been performed designed to confirm recently published calculations of the Fresnel corrected interfrequency correlation function of the time varying rough surface scatter channel. The experiments were performed in a physical model facility using a wind driven water surface. Preemphasized pulse probing was used to extract instantaneous transfer functions over a domain of 200 kHz-1.3 MHz. The results indicate good agreement with theory especially for large surface roughness and frequency domains higher than the cutoff of the coherent transfer function of the channel."
"When designing pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) systems for use over bandpass channels having restricted bandwidth, one may be led to use single-sideband (SSB) or vestigial sideband (VSB) transmission in order to maximize transmission rate. Carefully shaped pulses must be used to minimize degradation due to intersymbol interference (isi). In this paper VSB pulses are derived that have no inherent isi, and in addition have maximum immunity in a mean-squared-error (MSE) sense to timing and carrier phase errors. The results here generalize on those of Franks who treated the SSB case. The optimum VSB pulses are shown to be identical to those of Franks at the band edges, and to have vestigial roll-off characteristics of a similar discontinuous nature. It is also shown that one may allocate available bandwidth to the vestigial roll-off band band and Nyquist roll-off band in any way desired. The final performance for the optimum pulse depends only on the total bandwidth used. These results are shown to apply as well to a system employing a matched filter. The case of random timing and phase errors is also considered, and optimum pulses are again found. Several mathematical properties of the optimal pulses are given physical justification and geometric insight through error ellipses, and optimal signal shapes are plotted for various cases of special interest."
"This paper investigates the performance of compromise Viterbi algorithm (VA) and standard equalization techniques by computation and simulation over band-limited channels using fourlevel vestigial sideband (VSB) modulation. Linear channel characteristics from the published telephone channel survey were used as examples of band-limited data transmission channels. One of the principal conclusions drawn from the study is that at data rates of 9600 bits/s and less, the linear characteristics of these channels do not limit performance even with linear equalization. It was found that at this data rate, receivers based on linear equalization are very sensitive to timing and carrier phase over some channels. Thus at 9600 bits/s the decision feedback equalizer was found to be a better choice because it is relatively insensitive to carrier phase and timing considerations. Moreover, at 9600 bits/s no problem with error propagation was encountered with the decision feedback equalizer. As the data rate was increased beyond 9600 bits/s the decision feedback tap gains became large enough to cause severe error propagation. The compromise VA receiver structure was effective at higher data rates and was almost unaffected by channel bandwidth up to 12 000 bits/s."
"Adaptive meteor scatter communication requires a data storage which can transmit or receive data at a continuously variable rate. Several systems, designed around head-per-track rotating memories and shift register arrays, are discussed."
"Sequence estimation in the presence of additive Gaussian noise and intersymbol interference can be performed by means of discrete Kalman filters. In adaptive receivers for data transmission, the optimal Kalman gains must be computed on-line. A recursive algorithm is presented for this purpose and its performance, i.e., accuracy and computational requirements, is discussed briefly."
"Packet switching over broadcast channels with random access schemes is of current interest for local distribution system and for satellite channels. This mode of operation is useful when the communicating devices are mobile and when the ratio of the peak to average data rate requirement of each device is high. Such systems have been analyzed for the case in which all communicating devices are within an effective transmission range of each other; either directly or through the satellite. In this paper, we address broadcast networks in which originating devices cannot directly reach the destination receiver. Thus, devices are introduced which receive these packets and repeat them to the destination. The capacity (maximum throughput) of such systems is determined, and design problems related to the number of repeating devices and the usefulness of directional antennas are resolved."
"The selection of a particular signal set design for a bandwidth-constrained multiple amplitude-and-phase-amplitude-and-phase-shift-keyed (MAPSK) communication system with a linear additive Gaussian noise channel is influenced by a number of factors, such as average and/or peak signal-to-noise ratio for a given error probability, dynamic range of signal amplitudes, simplicity of generation and detection, and number of bit errors per adjacent symbol error (Gray code properties). This paper compares two possible quadrature amplitudes-shift-keyed (QASK) signal sets when the number of bits per symbol is odd (for the even-bit case, the square array is the only viable QASK choice). The \"symmetric\" QASK version outperforms the \"rectangular\" QASK set at a very modest implmentation penalty."
"The problem of determining the pull-in range of phaselocked loops is solved indirectly by evaluating the limit cycles of the loop in which the frequency error has a constant average. The analytical results derived here are in complete agreement with simulation results."
"A tunable matched filter for the major PCM codes has been synthesized utilizing a developmental bucket-brigade delay (BBD) line. The variable delay feature of the BBD allows continuous tuning of the matched filter over a wide range of bit rates. By combining and weighting the outputs of two BBD lines, matched filters for nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ), return-to-zero (RZ), and biphase codes are realized with a signal-to-noise performance within 0.8 dB of theoretical."
 "We report on the performance of band-limited staggered quadrature amplitude modulation (SQAM) in the presence of phase jitter and additive Gaussion noise. It is demonstrated that offsetting, or staggering, the in-phase and quadrature data streams by a fraction of a symbol interval improves the phase-jitter immunity of a conventional QAM data transmission system. For example, with a raised cosine pulse having unity rolloff, staggering can reduce the effective jitter variance by a factor of two. Under the constraint of no intersymbol interference, the optimum staggering epoch is shown to be half a symbol interval, and since the resulting system is equivalent to a form of vestigial sideband modulation (VSB)VSB is superior to QAM with respect to phase-jitter immunity. Using both optimum pulse design and data staggering, it is shown that the improvement over conventional QAM is proportional to the excess bandwidth. Consequently, SQAM may be warranted whenever a high-quality phase-locked loop is not used to track phase jitter. While the SQAM technique is not new, it has heretofore not been recognized as possessing the above-mentioned advantages."

"In this paper, the rationale and some advantages for multiaccess broadcast packet communication using satellite and ground radio channels are discussed. A mathematical model is formulated for a \"slotted ALOHA\" random access system. Using this model, a theory is put forth which gives a coherent qualitative interpretation of the system stability behavior which leads to the definition of a stability measure. Quantitative estimates for the relative instability of unstable channels are obtained. Numerical results are shown illustrating the trading relations among channel stability, throughput, and delay. These results provide tools for the performance evaluation and design of an uncontrolled slotted ALOHA system. Adaptive channel control schemes are studied in a companion paper."
"Multilevel fixed-length block codes which have a dcconstraint property are discussed, and the upper bounds of the transmission rates of such codes are described under the limitations of the running digital sums (RDS) of coded signal streams. Then stateindependent decodable codes whose transmission rates are equal to the upper bounds are presented for small values of word length. In these codes, four code words or less correspond to a source symbol. As an example, a 5-level code of length 4 whose RDS's do not exceed 4, whose transimission rate is equal to 2 bits per symbol, and from which good performance for bit timing, gain adjustment of repeaters, and word synchronization can be expected, is also described."
"An automatic transfer system provides a means of switching both ends of a working digital carrier span line automatically to a protection line when a failure occurs on a working line, without service interruption. Priority schemes enable one or two protection lines to serve any number of working lines. New design concepts expand the flexibility of automatic line transfer. Each digital span line may be protected separately and transferred independently. Interrogation and resetting on a span-by-span basis are also provided. All line transfers are signaled and the location of a failure anywhere in the system may be determined from a central location. Any span feeding lines originating or terminating within the system, or diverging at a remote office, may be protected by one or two protection lines."
"High-speed pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) data transmission systems require carefully shaped pulses having small bandwidth, and various coding schemes are used to increase transmission efficiency via spectrum shaping. Traditional hardware for the generation of such pulses, whether coded or not, is both difficult to design and expensive to implement. The binary transversal filter (BTF) has recently been studied in this context, and shown to be a promising alternative to other methods. It is inherently a binary device, however, and some coding schemes require multilevel signal outputs. Simple methods are presented in this paper that permit the use of a BTF for generating pulses such as bipolar, partial response, etc. The additional hardware required when coding is used is shown to be trivial in most cases."
"One of the synchronized systems of large digital transmission networks is the mutually synchronized system called the equational timing system. This system is, however, complicated, and its dynamic responses are not obtained analytically for general configuration. This paper describes dynamic responses and stability conditions of mutually synchronized systems applying the equational timing system under less stringent restrictions compared with previous discussions. Similar results for the fundamental mutually synchronized system can be obtained easily."
"A simple upper bound is derived to the difference in performance obtained from applying a given quanfizer to two different sources. This provides a bound on the performance loss or mismatch resulting when applying a quantizer designed for one source to another. The bound is in terms of a generalization of the Vasershtein distance between the source random variables and does not depend on the particular quantizer chosen. In particular, if two sources are sufficiently close in this sense, then any quantizer results in nearly identical performance on either source. Implications for optimal performance bounds are discussed and examples are given."
"This paper describes an interesting application of error correcting codes to improve the reliability of data transmission of a radio-based communication system. It shows how a low-cost system can be designed and constructed to bring significant improvements to the system's performance when a proper approach is taken to both select and implement the coding scheme."
"This concise paper shows that a band-limited bivariatenormal time series is a useful model for the envelope of scintillating radio signals traversing the ionosphere. A software model is presented whose generated time series is compared to an actual block of scintillation data. A comparison of computer-generated and actual scintillation data shows that the fade-duration distribution of the simulated data fits that of the actual data closely through proper choice of model parameters."
"The probability of error in a binary communication system using pseudonoise (PN) modulation to spread the transmitted spectrum is influenced by noise, bandlimiting, and synchronization errors. In this paper the average probability of error is determined, using a series expansion of the characteristic function of the intersymbol interference. It is shown that the effects of intersymbol interference are reduced by spreading and that local code synchronization errors become the dominant factor in the probability of error when the system bandwidth is large."
"Packet switching has found widespread application in computer communications because of its ability to efficiently handle high ratios of peak-to-average data rate. Packet radio is the application of packet switching techniques to radio channels. The resultant multiple-access problem requires novel approaches. Such approaches have been developed by others and have primarily been analyzed in steady-state behavior. This paper demonstrates and analyzes an important aspect of the dynamic characteristics of packet radio, namely, that of bistable behavior. That is, the system possesses two statistically stable equilibrium points, one in a desirable low-delay region, and the other in an undesirable high-delay region. Since the stability is only statistical in nature, the system oscillates between these two points. Even if the resultant steady-state behavior is very poor, this dynamic analysis frequently shows that system performance will be acceptable. This is due to quiet periods (such as at night) which allow the system to recover."
"Predictive coders have been suggested for use as analog data compression devices. Exact expressions for reconstructed signal error have been rare in the literature. In fact most results reported in the literature are based on the assumption of Gaussian statistics for prediction error. Predictive coding of first-order Gaussian Markov sequences are considered in this paper. A numerical iteration technique is used to solve for the prediction error statistics expressed as an infinite series in terms of Hermite polynomials. Several interesting properties of predictive coding are thereby demonstrated. First, prediction error is in fact close to Gaussian, even for the binary quantizer. Sencond, quantizer levels may be optimized at each iteration according to the calculated density. Finally, the existence of correlation between successive quantizer outputs is shown. Using the series solutions described above, performance in terms of meansquare reconstruction error versus bit rate can be shown to parallel the theoretical rate distortion function for the first-order Markov process by about 0.6 bits/sample at low bit rates."
"Efficiency and input resistance of short monopoles (or dipoles) may be significantly improved through use of a loading coil in series with the monopole wire. The piecewise sinusoidal moment method is used to analyze the loaded monopole. When loaded to resonance, the current rises from the feed value to a peak slightly beyond the load point with decay to zero at the end. Radiation resistance improvement factors as large as 5 have been calculated. The resonant loading reactance is shown to vary inversely with the antenna length for most lengths. Efficiency varies slowly with load point and peaks at roughly 0.4 from the feed, in contrast to earlier approximate theory that predicted higher efficiency for loads farther out toward the end. The curves allow a tradeoff between slightly reduced efficiency and larger input resistance (to allow easier matching) to be made. For this case, a 2/3 loading point may be a good compromise. The length for which efficiency is 50 percent is a useful design guide. This length varies slowly withQandh/aand is in the range 0.06 to 0.09 λ. Thus shorter monopoles will have low efficiency. Bandwidth is improved due to loading coil losses at the expense of efficiency; lossless loading bandwidth is unchanged over the unloaded monopole as the radiation resistance and reactance slope increase commensurately. Extensive graphical data are presented."
"Large round trip delay associated with satellite channels reduces the throughput for automatic repeat-request (ARQ) system of error control rather drastically under high error rate conditians. Ground segments that usually accompany satellite circuits at both ends introduce bursts of errors, during which block error rates tend to be quite high, bringing down the throughput to very low values. In this paper, some schemes that modify the currently known variations of ARQ (Stop-and-Wait and continuous systems) are suggested with a view to obtaining higher throughput under high block error rate conditions. Specifically, the modified Go-Back-Nsystem appears to be quite attractive, as it gives substantial improvement with little additional complexity in system implementation."
"The occurrence of both inter- and intrasymbol interference in a communications system utilizing orthogonal signals and memoryless correlation detection is described, and a system model is presented. A relationship between a bound on peak interference and time-bandwidth product for several well known orthogonal signal sets is reported."
"Very simple techniques for estimating the speed of a moving object from a television signal are described. They assume that frame storage is available. One technique requires little more than two threshold circuits and two counters. The accuracy of one technique is better than ± 10 percent, quite sufficient to enable the measure to be used as a control signal for the efficient coding of television type signals."
"The noncoherent binary frequency-shift keyed (FSK) receiver analyzed in this concise paper employs predetection filters with bandwidths much larger than the symbol rate. Wide-band predetection filtering is used in order to trade performance for simplicity and reduced costs. In this analysis bit-error rate (BER) degradation due to wide predetection filter bandwidths and intersymbol interference caused by postdetection filtering is determined. The postdetection filters considered are single-pole RC and two-pole Butterworth filters. The receiver performance using these filters is compared with the performance achieved when using integrate-and-dump postdetection filtering. Experimental and simulation results are presented which agree well with the analysis."

"In the above paper, a procedure is described that determines the probability that all communication paths between two nodes in a network are interrupted. The problem is solved by recursively splitting the original problem into smaller subproblems. In this correspondence, we demonstrate that in certain classes of networks identical subproblems have to be solved several times. Thus the efficiency of the algorithm can be further improved by storing the subnetworks and the results of their evaluation."

"As technology becomes increasingly able to meet the requirements, interest in faster, noncoherent, frequency-hopping rates to reduce detectability of communications has heightened. The question of what dectect on method is to be used for transmissions which have been frequency-hopped at a rate faster than the data rate thus arises. This concise paper presents the derivation of the optimum detector for binary frequency-shift keying (FSK) noncoherently frequency-hopped at an integer multiple of the data rate. The performance of this detector and simpler implemented nonoptimum detectors are examined by simulation."
"Cyclic codes are very attractive for error detection because of their low cost encoding and decoding circuits, and because of their high guaranteed minimum distance, but they suffer from very poor protection when word frame synchronization is lost. This note suggests starting the encoder and decoder circuits in an essentially random state, instead of the usual all-zero state. Under this condition of operation it is shown that the undetected error rate against synchronization loss is2^{-p}wherepis the number of parity check bits."
"This study is concerned with the problem of monitoring the performance of communication links, as indicated by bit error rate, with the objective of detecting as rapidly as possible failures or extreme degradation caused by any source. The monitoring method is based on the use of an artificial threshold for the decision variable and the generation of a measurable \"pseudoerror.\" The study relates pseudoerror probability to true-error probability for two models-one using an analytical-numerical approach and the other using a Monte Carlo simulation. Variation of the parameters in the models adequately approximates the first-order effects of many types of link failure. The results indicate that a monitor indication based on pseudoerror is feasible and has many desirable properties."
"Edge busyness in delta modulation (AM) is analyzed theoretically and a method of reducing edge busyness is presented. By assuming a simple model for quantizing error waveforms, a theoretical signal-to-edge noise ratio is derived as a function of signal slope. It is shown that more than 10-dB edge-busyness reduction can be achieved by limiting input signal slope to about 80 percent of the\\DeltaMoverload slope prior to\\DeltaM. The performance is verified through computer simulation and experimentation."
"The background for the characterization of small aperture earth stations suitable for use in a proposed U.S. Domestic System is described and system considerations for transmission performance given. Three experimental stations were constructed and extensively tested to demonstrate the key features required. Test results are given for antenna gain, noise, station G/T, and television transmission performance. The system used an FM subcarrier for audio transmission, and crosstalk between the video and audio signals was determined. Interference from terrestrial radio relay systems was encountered at the test location, and the RF spectrum plotted. Sun outage was measured during the autumnal equinox."
"Very few techniques exist for reliability evaluation of communication systems where links as well as nodes have certain probability of failure. This correspondence describes a technique by which the reliability expression for such a system can be conveniently derived. It is also shown that using the concept of this correspondence, it is possible to extend all the existing reliability-evaluation algorithms to communication systems with little effort."
"A binary noncoherent frequency-shift-keying (NCFSK) multiple-message one-shot radio transmission system is discussed where the receiver has no prior knowledge of the possible starting time of transmission. In this system each transmitted signal has a common preamble for signal acquisition and self-synchronization purposes. System design procedures are described for allowable frequency of occurrence of false alarm and probabilities of a miss and a message error specified for the system. In addition, the probability of premature response (i.e., the probability that the receiver makes an affirmative decision on acquisition of the signal when the sync preamble is only partially received) is taken into account. It is shown that the selection of sync preamble codes from randomly generated binary sequences can be a highly attractive approach. A simple, but very meaningful, criterion is suggested for aid in such a selection. The system described here can be used as a radio warning system and also as a selective call or selective interrogation system."
"An automatic gain control (AGC) loop is presented for use withM-ary amplitude- and phase-shift keying (MAPSK) systems. The gain control amplifier is regulated by an error signal formed by the difference between the estimated amplitude level and the received amplitude level. The AGC performance is thus independent of the short-term average received signal energy. AGC loop analysis and simulation is presented forM-ary amplitude-shift keying (MASK) and quadrature amplitude-shift keying (QASK). The AGC is shown to have a negligible degradation on the symbol probability of error for most practical cases. A generalized AGC for an arbitrary MAPSK system is also presented."
"Systems which locate and identify moving vehicles without the active cooperation of either the vehicle operator or its passengers are being considered for various applications, including identification and subsequent billing for vehicles passing toll booths, and location and identification of railroad locomotives. This paper considers the design of identification signals transmitted from (to) a moving vehicle to (from) roadside receivers (transmitters) at various known locations. The paper includes: 1) discussion of some of the important design factors; 2) consideration of modulation/demodulation schemes suitable for vehicle identification and location (VLI) systems; 3) analysis of inexpensive and easily implemented schemes for improving vehicle-detection accuracy by averaging repeated sequences of vehicle-identification symbols; 4) evaluation of binary codes for vehicle identification; 5) analysis and evaluation of schemes for synchronizing binary-coded VLI sequences; and 6) a design example illustrating concepts developed in the paper. It is shown that use of simple binary codes, including constant ratio or single parity check codes, in conjunction with signal averaging, often yields better performance at less cost than systems which employ complex coding/decoding schemes."
"The signal-to-noise(S/N)ratio of digital signals can be improved by using diversity transmission, followed by combining at the receive end, resulting in a lower probability of errorP(e). Second-order combining schemes for data signals are presented in this paper. The effect of delay difference in the two channels of a diversity system is analyzed, using four-phase coherent, phase-shift keying (PSK) as an example. For comparison with predicted performance, experimental results are included."
"Using some basic concepts of ionospheric propagation, multipath and Doppler spread calculations are obtained for the HF ionospheric communication channel. Because of sensitivity to the solar control mechanism, the Doppler spread results are found to demonstrate a pronounced dependence on time of day and operating frequency. The practical consequences of these calculations are discussed in detail. This includes the definition and generation of the \"Doppler reduction factor,\" comparable to the \"multipath reduction factor,\" which can be used to determine the appropriate operating frequency on a given HF link."
"This paper presents simple and general lower bounds for error rates in digital communication systems. The information bearing signal is taken to be impaired by additive interference and carrier phase jitter. The former is taken to be composed of two components; one component is peak-limited while the other is not. Intersymbol and cochannel interference are examples of peak-limited interference while additive thermal noise is an example of a nonpeak-limited interference. The novelty of the paper is in the generality of the results and in obtaining a simple error bound for transmission in the presence of cochannel interference and carrier phase jitter."
"A design procedure for the receiver of a pulse amplitude modulation system is developed for data transmission in the presence of intersymbol interference and noise. In the receiver, an estimate of each source symbol is made based on the WienerKolmogorov theory of minimum variance estimation for stationary time series. The resulting structure is called a recursive equalizer and its taps are obtained by taking the canonical factorization of the spectral density function followed by the operations of polynomial multiplication and division. The performance of the system is evaluated by calculating the probability of error versus signal-signal-to-noise ratio and Comparing it to the performance of a conventional tapped delay line equalizer. The specific example presented uses raised-cosine signaling through a channel with slope-attenuation distortion and a zero phase characteristic. For this example, the recursive equalizer is shown to exhibit superior-performance."

"The reliable transmission of information over communication channels depends greatly on the adequacy of the maintenance program provided for the transmission medium. An integral part of such a program is the procedure used for determining the quality of a communication link. In this concise paper, we discuss several statistical methods for ascertaining those impairments-and their respective levels-which reveal the most information about the fidelity of the channel in signal transmission. For the purpose of illustration, an example is presented which demonstrates how a testing program could implement each particular statistical method."
"Pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) is extended to two and four dimensions by means of a nonlinear, memoryless mapping to obtain pulse-amplitude-and-phase modulation (PAPM). This modulation requires either the same bandwidth as double-sideband PAM or twice as much but yields a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement factor similar to that of FM with considerably less sacrifice of spectral occupancy. Several signal-space mappings are investigated for Gaussian data. Expressions for output SNR are derived in terms of a linear error above threshold and an anomalous threshold-producing error. PAPM is compared with various modulation techniques in terms of power and bandwidth requirements. The degradations in output SNR caused by carrier phase, carrier amplitude, and sample timing reference errors are evaluated so that requirements for demodulator design can be specified."
"The zero-forcing automatic equalization technique is extended to equalization in quadrature amplitude modulation data transmission and TV transmission systems. A general cost function, whose minimization problem can be applied to the automatic equalization in the above two systems, is first presented. Based on this cost function, the zero-forcing equalizability condition is solved. Under this condition, simple algorithms, namely unit-increment or amplitude-dependent tap adjusting schemes, can be applied."
"An analytical expression for the phase error characteristics of a second-order phase-lock loop (PLL) is determined using the results of a previous nonlinear analysis. The characteristics determined are for sinusoidal FM in the absence of noise. Theoretical and experimental results are compared and are in close agreement. The theoretical results are useful as a design aid and in determining the proper parameters for the operation of a second-order PLL."
"The multipath communication channel for space communication is modeled as a multiplicative channel. This paper discusses the effects of the multiplicative channel processes on the symbol error rate for quadrature modulation (QM) digital modulation schemes. An expression for the upper bound on the probability of error is derived and numerically evaluated. The results are compared with those obtained for additive channels."
"The communication system considered is characterized by a large number of stations transmitting messages through a simple binary channel to a single central receiver in an unsynchronized and unorganized fashion. Individual messages are repeated according to statistical criteria. The form of coding selected permits detection but not separation of coinciding or overlapping messages. Hardware requirements are discussed, and a model system, whose behavior is in agreement with theoretical results, is described. A conclusion is that the proposed system is well suited to simple alarm and telemetry applications."
"A self-recovering equalization algorithm, which is employed in multilevel amplitude-modulated data transmission, is presented. Such a self-recovering equalizer has been required when time-division multiplexed (TDM) voice or picturephone PCM signals must be transmitted over the existing frequency-division multiplexed (FDM) transmission channel. The present self-recovering equalizer is quite simple, as is a conventional binary equalizer. The convergence processes of the present self-recovering equalizer are shown by computer simulation. Some theoretical considerations on this convergence process are also added."
"For networks that exhibit neither concentration nor expansion, the well-known probabilistic model of C. Y. Lee is refined so as to take account of the dependence of events in different stages. For series-parallel networks, the refined model yields exact expressions for the point-to-point blocking probability. These expressions bear the same relationship to the refined model as the KittredgeMolina expressions do to Lee's model. Comparison between the two sets of expressions shows that Lee's model tends to overestimate the blocking probability. Asymptotic analysis of the new expressions leads to improved upper bounds on the cost: it is shown that a network that carriesNerlangs with a blocking probability at most\\epsilon > 0can be built with6N \\log_{2} N + O(N \\log \\log 1/\\epsilon)contacts."
"An error-probability upper-bound is developed for coherent phase-shift keying (CPSK) considering the combined effects of Gaussian noise, intersymbol interference (ISI), and several peak-limited circular-symmetric (CS) components such as adjacent-channel interference (ACI) and cochannel interference (CCI). In an earlier paper [1], an upper bound was introduced, based on the \"maximizing probability density function\" concept, for CPSK with Gaussian noise and a single CS interference. The natural extension of this type of bound to multiple mixed interferences-such as are encountered in practice-is given in this sequel. This multiple interferer bound, which is computationally simple to use, requires only the peak and mean-square values of the several interferences involved, and is optimal in the sense that no other bound, based solely on the same information, will be lower than it. Through examples we draw comparisons with previously available results, which show that the multiple-interference limited-peak bound, when applied to composite interference situations, can be an effective tool for system design and analysis."
"In this paper we consider the digitization and coding of graphics, specifically typewritten letters, and make two contributions. The first contribution concerns the tradeoff between resolution and number of gray levels. We carried out subjective tests which showed that, in order to get better image quality at a given bit rate, for good-quality originals, one should use only two levels/sample and higher resolution; while for poor-quality originals, one should use more levels/sample. Second, we estimated the bit rates achievable when bit-plane run length coding is applied to the multilevel images."
"Much has been said in the literature with regard to the problem of establishing symbol synchronization in binary baseband digital communication systems. By comparison, the literature contains little information relating to the extraction of symbol sync from multilevel baseband data. With the recent interest in multilevel amplitude-shift keying (MASK) and quadrature amplitude-shift keying (QASK) as signaling techniques for multilevel digital communications systems, the problem of providing symbol synchronization in the receivers of such systems becomes paramount. This paper presents a technique for extracting symbol sync from an MASK or QASK signal which has been transmitted over an infinite bandwidth white Gaussian noise channel. The scheme is essentially a generalization of the data transition tracking loop (DTTL) which has heretofore been used in PSK systems. The performance of the loop is analyzed in terms of its mean-squared symbol sync jitter and its effects on the data detection process in MASK and QASK systems."
"The problem of calculating the reliability of a communication network of given topology is discussed. The definition of failure is generalized from simple disconnection to the event that terminal capacity falls below some threshold, and simple methods are developed for bounding the probability of such failures and for approximating the mean time between failures (MTBF). It is shown that the cumulative distribution function of terminal capacity is readily calculated, and that the dependence of network reliability on individual link reliability is substantially different when the generalized (and more realistic) definition of failure is used."
"This paper describes experiments with a television (TV) source encoder which consists of a differential PCM encoder followed by entropy coding. This encoder converts analog television signals into a digital bit stream for digital transmission or storage. When optimized, this type of system is known to perform very close to the rate distortion bound. The differential PCM encoder has a 16-level quantizer during low entropy areas of the picture (quiet areas) but switches to a 6-level quantizer in high entropy (busy) areas of the picture which tend to fill up the buffer. This strategy avoids buffer overflow and has the desirable property that it produces low noise in quiet areas of the picture and higher noise in busy areas of the picture."
"An equalizer based on the minimum mean-square error (MSE) criterion, but with direct solution of the resulting equations, is described. The direct solution is based on the algorithms devised by Levinson and Trench. With the availability of large-scale integration (LSI) bipolar computing elements, these algorithms are competitive with iterative procedures. A method is considered for the estimation of the required parameters, and for automatic adaption to a changing channel. It is shown that the delay can be adjusted to achieve minimum MSE with respect to that parameter. Simulations undertaken show the robust performance of the algorithm, and that the equalizer performance is not adversely affected by operation in decision-directed mode."
 "The margin of a high-speed digital regenerative repeater can be determined easily by adding a misterminated stub at the repeater input. The stub adds an interfering signal which, if large enough, will cause the repeater to make errors. The amplitude of the interfering signal is determined by the termination, so the termination impedance at which errors begin is a good measure of repeater margin. No calibration procedure is required."
"In this paper an investigation of some routing methods suitable for a special computer communication network called TIDAS-T, in which the traffic exchange is done according to the store and forward message-switching technique, is elucidated. The properties of different routing procedures and sensitivity of some parameter settings during the various conditions, that may occur in this network, have been studied by simulations with a specially made model for the TIDAS-T computer network. It has turned out that due to the requirements for TIDAS the best routing procedure is a one-parametric adaptive method, which has built-in instruments to adapt to the different situations that can arise in the net, for instance, when line and/or node errors occur. This procedure is in principal similar to the one used in the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) net. However, some extensions and added features, such as the introduction of the concepts split horizon, immediate updating mode and skipping constant, have given the procedure more power to react on complex net errors and to reduce circulating traffic. The method is in principal quite general and will therefore be suitable for many other message-switching computer networks. However, the parameter settings in the procedure are specially tuned for this network by simulation runs."

"Quick-look nonsystematic convolutional codes have the property that the information sequence may be recovered from the encoded sequence in straightforward fashion and with a minimum of error amplification. In this concise paper we investigate their relevant characteristics for constraint lengths less than eight and rate\\frac{1}{2}and obtain a number of interesting and practically useful results. In particular, for the best of these codes, we derive their free distance and error amplification, their decoded bit error probability when used over the binary symmetric channel in conjunction with Viterbi decoding, and show how they can be employed to measure the channel bit error rate."
"The weighted sum of the absolute values of the transform coefficients, defined herein as the activity index, is proposed as an objective measure of scene busyness (i.e., the density of significant scene detail). For an image divided into subpictures, it is possible to classify each subpicture into a finite number (say four) of categories according to its computed activity index. A different coding scheme, involving different truncation and quantization rules and hence a different number of bits, is used for each activity category. Data compression is efficiently achieved by assigning more bits to code those portions of the image showing the most detail."

"A modification of a discrete-time method of synchronizing the clock frequencies in a digital communications network which makes the system frequency independent of time-varying transmission delays in the links of the network is discussed."
"Several modems and satellite subsystems were tested with the aid of an aeronautical channel simulation facility. The modems tested include a high-performance differential phase-shift keyed (DPSK) modem, a high-performance coherent phase-shift keyed (CPSK) modem, two hybrid voice-data modems, and a lower performance CPSK modem. Data performance results are presented in the form of probability of bit error versus signal-to-noise density and signal-to-multipath ratios with Doppler spread as a parameter. Some tests were conducted with a hard limiting IF processor in cascade with the channel simulator to simulate satellite characteristics. The characteristics of the aeronautical-satellite channel simulator are also described. The discussion concludes with a general evaluation of the effect of aeronautical-satellite channel characteristics on modem performance, as derived from the simulation experiments."
"This paper summarizes 1) harmonic signal output for a variety of class C power amplifier models and 2) other biased amplifier configurations when the input consists of an arbitrary number of carriers plus noise; it also demonstrates signal suppression and/ or enhancement in the class C amplification process for several signal sets and amplifier models, and it develops expressions for output signal-to-intermodulation noise ratio if the input consists of a large number of equal amplitude carriers. Results are given in tabular form."
"A binary bandpass communications system is considered, in which the ratio of bandwidth to intermediate frequency (IF) is not necessarily small. Closed-form expressions are given in the case when the receiver (IF) filter hasNdistinct poles. Explicit results, namely probabilities of error, are computed when the filter is a bandpass Butterworth filter. The effect ofk = f_{0}/f_{r}(ratio of half filter bandwidth to IF),f_{0}T(product of half filter bandwidth and bit duration),N, phase and time jitter on probability of error, is investigated."
"Using a multiple-scatter propagation theory, the characteristics of the transionospheric satellite-earth communication links are related to the parameters of the ionosphere. General equations for the frequency correlation functions are derived. Some approximate solutions are obtained and numerical examples are given. Also discussed are the degree of coherence and potential applications of the procedure to characterize the intense fading channel."
"Solid-state technology is available to permit the design of multichannel station carrier systems with \"prove-in\" distances of 18 kft or less. Customer acceptance of these systems will depend on transmission performance, installation and maintenance ease, service reliability, and application restriction, as well as the per-channel installed cost. This paper discusses these parameters with regard to digital and analog carrier and carrier-concentrator systems."
"A numerical procedure for determining the cyclically permutable code of any length over an arbitrary alphabet is outlined. This method is easily programmed on a digital computer. A formula for the Hamming weight distribution of the code is also given. The results for the 12 bit binary cyclically permutable code are presented along with the weight distribution of the binary codes through length 14."
"The effectiveness of hybrid error control schemes involving forward error correction (FEC) and automatic repeat request (ARQ) is examined for satellite channels. The principal features of the channel are: large round-trip transmission delay due to the satellite link, and burst errors introduced by the terrestrial links that connect the users to the satellite link. The performance is estimated for two channels described by Fritchman's simple partitioned finite-state Markov model, and is compared to that obtainable if the channel is considered as a binary symmetric channel of the same bit error probability. Results show that the hybrid schemes offer substantial improvement over ARQ and FEC, and that an optimum exists for the number of errors corrected to obtain maximum throughput efficiency."
"The method and results are reported of subjective assessment tests on the perception of motion in television signals. Discussed are applications of these results to the transmission technique for the difference between two adjacent frame signals. The main results are as follows. 1) Smoothness of motion is lost by field-repeating or frame-repeating TV signals, unless motion is slow. The just perceptible velocity and acceptable limit of velocity are determined by subjective tests. The velocity of moving objects should be very low in order to obtain smooth motion. 2) The precision required in separating the standard television signal into stationary and moving parts is derived from the just perceptible velocity in 1). It is about 1/3 of a Nyquist interval; that is, equivalent to a viewing angle of 45 s, when the viewing distance is 4 × (height of picture). 3) The apparent Gaussian noise level increases by 1 ∼ 3 dB when television pictures are field-repeated. On the other hand, it decreases in frame-repeated pictures, provided that the number of repetitions is small. 4) From subjective assessment of the degradation of picture quality caused by blurring of the moving part, it becomes clear that the bandwidth of the signal of the moving part can readily be reduced by a factor of 3.5."
"Telephone switching systems provide facilities to measure subscriber usage for billing purposes. As new telephone services are offered, additional equipment is often required to appropriately measure this usage. Rate plans are being considered by telephone companies to more appropriately reflect service rendered on local telephone calls and additional equipment is required. This paper describes an electronic local message accounting system to measure local call usage which can be appliquéd to Panel, No. 1 crossbar, No. 5 crossbar, and Step-by-Step switching entities. Magnetic tape records for each local call provide: directory number of the calling party, distance to the called party, duration, and time of call termination. This information allows subscriber billing based on many and varied criteria which are established by software at the revenue accounting office. The system is presently in widespread use. The first installation occurred in January 1972, and now almost 5 percent of all telephones in the United States are served by the system."
"An earlier paper [2] presented algorithms for designing gradings for random hunt selectors, The gradings were designed to have a particular kind of combinatorial symmetry called \"uniform overlap.\" The uniform overlap condition is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for grading design. The lack of sufficiency is particularly apparent for gradings With small interconnection numbers. The structural characteristics of such gradings are examined and desirable characteristics of practical gradings are identified. A parameterTis defined as a grading characteristic and procedures are presented for designing gradings having minimal values ofT. Since there is, in general, no unique solution to the problem of designing a uniform overlap grading, the recommendation is made for given reasons that the solution selected should have the smallest value ofT."
"Extension of the 24 channelT1carrier concept to a 48 channel system requires a careful investigation of the limitations imposed by the increased crosstalk noise susceptibility of 48 channel regenerators. Results of this paper demonstrate the feasibility of dual cable and single-screened cable operation of 48 channel lines at repeater spacings comparable toT1spacing. Operation over singlecable facilities is limited by NEXT to cables with a large cross section and is further restricted to only selected conductors in such a cable. A final result establishes thatT1and 48 channel systems may operate simultaneously in facilities engineered according to 48 channel crosstalk requirements."
"A design for an adaptive three-port electronic circulator is presented. The circuit has particular use in telephone work and this model can provide isolation when the terminating load varies over the range200 \\Omega - 1 k\\Omega. The whole circuit is realizable in microelectronic form."
"The economics and performance of packet-switched satellite systems operating in a broadcast mode are studied and compared to landline-based systems similar to the ARPANET. The fixed-packet length inefficiencies and the satellite channel utilization of the satellite systems are presented as functions of the message length distribution, the number of earth stations, the average message delay, and the average number of messages generated at each earth station. Some of the economic factors in the design of packetswitched satellite networks are discussed, including hardware costs as a function of technology and system performance. Satellite network configurations with or without backhaul facilities are compared and it is concluded that configurations using backhaul facilities consisting of two 30 mile private leased lines (each 50 kbits/s) are more expensive. Parameters and estimated costs of satellite system configurations are presented and an engineering estimate of the cost function for satellite packet-switched networks is derived and presented in the form of long range average cost curves. Economies of scale with respect to network traffic and diseconomies of scale with respect to the number of network earth stations are found to be present."
"An optimal coding scheme is offered for binary messages with a limited number of successive runs of length 1 (i.e., strings of the form 010101..., in the messages, have a known limited length). A practical example is given of a case where such messages are found."
"The classical Viterbi decoder recursively finds the trellis path (code word) closest to the received data. Given the received data, the syndrome decoder first forms a syndrome, instead. A recursive algorithm like Viterbi's is used to determine the noise sequence of minimum Hamming weight that can be a possible cause of this syndrome. Given the estimate of the noise sequence, one derives an estimate of the original data sequence. While the bit error probability of the syndrome decoder is no different from that of the classical Viterbi decoder, the syndrome decoder can be implemented using a read only memory (ROM), thus obtaining a considerable saving in hardware."

"In 1969 Iwersen [4] analyzed the quantizing noise (assuming no slope overload) associated with a delta modulator (\\DeltaM) with step-size imbalance. In this concise paper we consider the effects of both step-size imbalance and quantizer threshold hysteresis on\\DeltaMquantizing noise. The analysis is restricted to the important case of zero input signal. For this case we extend Iwersen's work to show that quantizer threshold hysteresis can significantly change the spectral shape of the idle channel noise. Our approach is to first construct two locus functions, one for the samples (of the steady-state noise waveform) taken at arbitrarily defined even sampling times and one for those taken at the odd sampling times. The noise waveform is then obtained as a superposition of interleaved samples of the even and odd loci. It is shown that the noise spectrum has a discrete tonal struture whose frequencies are independent of hysteresis and are determined solely by step imbalance as in Iwersen's analysis. Hysteresis changes the magnitude and phase of the discrete tones. We characterize the tone magnitude changes due to hysteresis and show that hysteresis can amplify, attenuate, or completely eliminate a tone. We present curves which specify the tone magnitude attenuation as a function of step imbalance ε, average step size σ, and hysteresish. We also calculate PT, the total noise power in the baseband up to half the sampling frequency. It is shown that for0 \\leq h \\leq \\epsilon,P_{T} = \\sigma^{2}/3independent ofhand ε ;forh > \\epsilon, PTis an increasing function of\\epsilon/\\sigmaandh/\\epsilon."
"A new technique for linear amplification of envelopevarying bandpass signals using sampling techniques (LIST) and devices having nonlinear input-output relationships is described. Two component signals are produced by phase-reversal modulating two quadrature carriers with two delta-coded low-pass envelopes derived from the quadrature components of a bandpass signal. The component signals either are produced at a high level or are amplified in nonlinear amplifiers. An amplified replica of the input signal results from passively summing and bandpass filtering these two component signals. A laboratory demonstration shows that a LIST amplifier with spurious 40 dB below desired signals in a two-tone test is easily achieved."
"A new packet-switching network technique is described which, while utilizing certain aspects of the ARPANET technology, introduces a substantially different technique for handling traffic which is longer than a single packet in length. The technique is keyed to a common-user network environment, where a wide variety of subscriber types, ranging from computers to simple terminals, are to be serviced. Subscribers in most cases would be remotely located from the network switching nodes. By splitting the buffering between the originating and destination nodes and by essentially eliminating the segment reassembly process, substantial reductions in on-line buffering can be achieved, while still maintaining short response times for interactive messages and large bandwidths for long data exchanges. In this paper we describe the network operational concepts and traffic flow for various subscriber types, show specific examples and timing diagrams for message flows, and present a comparative analysis of the buffer sizing, throughput, and delay for this new technique compared to the well-known ARPANET technique of packet switching."
"In digital pulse-code modulation (DPCM) transmission of pictures, often a two-dimensional (2-D) predictor is considered for use in the feedback loop. This paper considers the problem of stability of this 2-D recursive filter. It is assumed the predictor is designed to minimize the mean-square error over the space of all linear predictors. For positive definite correlation arrays it is shown that the first-order recursive filter which uses the previous element in the same row and column can be unstable. It is also shown that the bilinear recursive filter which uses the three nearest neighbors to the left and above may be unstable. When the correlation function of the data is isotropic, it is shown that stability follows for these two classes of filters."
"Alphabetic pseudoternary codes, which are being used largely for high-capacity pulse-code modulation (PCM) transmission, require character alignment of the received ternary sequence for correct conversion from pseudoternary to straight binary. In this paper a method and a strategy of character alignment for MS43 line code are proposed. The method is based on the recognition of the constraints and correlations involved by the conversion rules of MS43; the strategy, which is similar to that already used for frame alignment in PCM time-division-multiplex (PCM-TDM) systems, allows limiting of the effects of simulations and line errors on the processes of loss and recovery of character alignment. Statistical properties of these processes are analyzed both theoretically and by computer simulation. The results are used to design the character alignment strategy for a 34.368 Mbit/s PCM system using MS43 as line code."
"Many redundancy removal algorithms employ some sort of run length code. Blocks of timing words are coded with synchronization words inserted between blocks. The probability of incorrectly reconstructing a sample because of a channel error in the timing data is a monotonically nondecreasing function of time since the last synchronization word. In this paper we compute the \"probability that the accumulated magnitude of timing errors equal zero\" as a function of time since the last synchronization word for a zero-order predictor (ZOP). The result is valid for any data source that can be modeled by a first-order Markov chain and any digital channel that can be modeled by a channel transition matrix. An example is presented."
"An optimum linear receiver for multiple channel digital transmission systems is developed for the minimum Peand for the zero-forcing criterion. A multidimensional Nyquist criterion is defined together with a theorem on the optimality of a finite lenght multiple tapped delay line. Furthermore an algorithm is given to calculate the tap settings of this multiple tapped delay line. This algorithm simplifies in those cases where the noise is so small that it can be neglected. Finally as an example the transmission of binary data over a cable, consisting of four identical wires, symmetrically situated inside a cylindrical shield, is considered."
"The effective availability kEof a link system is expressible as the product of an average availabilityMand an availability factorg. A general expression is derived forgfor link systems providing access to trunk groups carrying smooth traffic. The value ofgobtained for smooth traffic is shown to be applicable to trunk groups offered random traffic. The validity of the theory is demonstrated by application to a three-stage link system and comparing the results obtained with the results obtained by using the methods of Jacobaeus."

  "This paper investigates some of the properties of a class of two-level codes with constrained run length, whose use has been proposed for purposes of bandwidth compression. It is shown that such codes can indeed reduce the bandwidth containing a given percentage of the transmitted power. To communicate information, however, different transmitted codewords must be distinguishable at the receiver, and this requires that the channel bandwidth be sufficiently wide to allow the difference waveform to propagate. It is demonstrated that decreasing theX-percent bandwidth using these codes leads to a rapid increase in the difference waveform bandwidth, and hence in the channel bandwidth necessary to maintain error rate performance. Thus, these codes are bandwidth expansion codes in disguise. Signal-to-noise ratio and channel bandwidth requirements for these codes are discussed and compared with those ofM-level codes [pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM)] for two kinds of receivers."

"An overshoot suppression scheme to improve the performance of the digital Song adaptive delta modulator (DM) for picture transmission is described. This scheme allows for a faster increase in the step sizes than permitted by overshoot and settling time considerations, thus improving rise-time performance. The overshoot suppression (OSS) algorithm used has been verified using computer simulation on a PDP-8. Furthermore, experimental results using computer generated test pictures as well as pictures from a flying-spot scanner show the improvements due to the overshoot suppression scheme. It is also shown that the additional hardware required for the actual implementation of the algorithm is simpler than those encountered in the literature, and gives better signal-tracking accuracy. Upper bounds for the settling time, with and without OSS, are derived showing an improvement with the suppression scheme. Stability conditions are also derived permitting the proper selection of DM parameters."
"New convolutional self-orthogonal codes (CSOC's) are generated by extending the work of Massey and Robinson. These classes of high-rate or low-redundancy codes are known to be threshold decodable. Actual applications have demonstrated the usefulness of these codes for satellite communications. Part I of this paper contains codes from rates 2/3 to 13/14, with code minimum distances varying from 4 to 51."
"Measurements at the Northern Electric cable plant in Lachine [2] and elsewhere [3],[4] showed that at low frequencies near-end crosstalk loss (NEXT) and far-end crosstalk loss (FEXT) for adjacent pairs do not have slopes of 15 dB/decade and 20 dB/ decade, respectively. In this paper an approximation predicts a slope of 5 dB/decade for NEXT and long cable and 10 dB/decade for FEXT."
"A general expression is derived for the tap settings of a linear transversal equalizer using the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion when the class-4 partial-response (PR) signal is distorted by noise as well as carrier phase and timing errors. The values of the tap settings are used to reduce the carrier and timing phase errors."
"An implanted physiological-signal telemetry unit for an ambulatory animal is described. It uses a single 1.35 V mercury cell, is1 \\times 2.5 \\times 4cm in size, and weighs 15 g. Transcutaneous RF turn-on and magnetic turn-off are used to conserve battery power. The battery can operate 175 h before replacement. An integrated circuit amplifier supplies a voltage gain of 250 over a nominal band from 0.2 Hz to over 4 kHz. With 2 mV peak input, it yields 75 kHz peak deviation of a 20 MHz carrier. Relations between frequency,Q, receiving antenna voltage, and implant coil diameter are derived. Circuits are also given for a \"turn-on\" device, a 20 MHz converter, and the sequential gating of three mutually perpendicular antennas to avoid dropouts as the animal moves within the cage."
"We consider the design of a receiver for a digital optical fiber system operating with multilevel pulse amplitude modulation. This form of modulation provides for high bit rates on digital systems employing large diameter optical fibers and LED sources. The receiver configuration analysis is one with a p-i-n avalanche photodetector and a FET preamplifier. The analysis is complicated by the fact that the signal levels and threshold boundries have to be nonuniformly spaced to cope with signal dependent shot noise introduced by the photodiode detector. An algorithm for level placement is reported. Performance figures for typical systems, with optical pulse shape which are either Gaussian or exponential, are calculated."
"In this concise paper we described the simulation approach for a general centralized computer communication system with emphasis on efficiency and versatility. The simulation program consists of three modules representing different levels in a hierarchy. The lowest level models the polled multidrop line connecting remote terminals to the concentrator. The second level models the trunk lines and the concentrator which interfaces the multidrop lines of lower speed to one or more higher speed trunk lines connected to a central computer. The highest level models the central computer which communicates with remote terminals via the trunks. A hybrid simulation approach is used to ease program development and to shorten computer running time. When feasible, empirical distributions, analytical formulas, or analytical models are used to eliminate simulation steps and simplify simulation procedures. The techniques developed are illustrated by application to the NASDAQ system."
"LetH[s(\\bullet),t]be a functional of the functions(\\bullet)and the independent variablet. The criterion functionalJ(s)is defined to be the integral ofHoverT, a set of pointst. The problem considered is the maximization ofJ(s)with respect to an amplitudeconstrained functions. Necessary conditons for the optimal solution are obtained, and a method of determining the optimumsis given. Some examples are presented to clarify the theorems and their applications."
"An experimental shifting technique applied to real television images in order to reduce their redundancy is described. The technique consists of dividing the images into zones and then transmitting vectors that connect correlated zones in successive frames. A threshold which is a function of frame-to-frame zone velocity and inherent points luminance is introduced to determine the shift vector. Image reconstructions are obtained with an information rate equal to 0.7 bit/pel."
"The application of multiplexed PCM channels to a microwave radio system is attractive in areas where geographic terrain limits the practicality of cable plant construction. A technique of interfacing the digital signal with an analog radio baseband is described. The successful Inclusion of a voice-frequency (VF) orderwire at the low frequency end of the digital spectrum without a significant penalty in error-rate performance demonstrates the efficiency of the technique."
"This paper presents results on the analysis and digital hardware realization of a non-Gaussian impulse noise source which can be used to model the impulsive noise present in wide-band communications systems. The impulse noise appearing in practical systems is characterized by bursts of much higher amplitudes than would be predicted by a normal- or Gaussian-distribution law. A need exists for a better characterization of this non-Gaussian impulsive noise as well as actual noise generators which can be used for evaluation of present and future communications equipment under realistic system-operating conditions. The impulse noise model and the realization of the noise generator described in this paper are capable of producing Gaussian background noise, lognormal impulsive noise, and burst timing to set prescribed starting and ending times of the bursts and impulse density within each of the burst periods. The techniques used in this paper are based on first generating a basic pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) and then from this deriving the Gaussian background noise by adding samples from the PRBS generator. The lognormal noise is then derived from the same sequence by using an incremental exponential generator. The burst timing signals which realize an approximate Poisson distribution are obtained by observing the occurrences of specific subsequences from the PRBS generator."
"We consider the problem of simultaneously estimating the phase and polarization angles of a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave. The solution of this problem has applications to space communications and ionospheric probing. The nonlinear stochastic characteristics of a cross-coupled double-loop implementation for the tracker are evaluated using the multidimensional Fokker-Planck equation. The exact stationary probability density is found for a special case of equal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the two loops. The stationary probability density is obtained for a general class of double loops when the two loop bandwidths differ greatly."
"The error performance of a digital FM system is studied in the presence of additive Gaussian noise. This system is a conventional one employing a voltage-controlled oscillator as the modulator and a limiter-discriminator followed by a low-pass filter as the demodulator. The notion of \"clicks\" introduced by Rice, and used by Mazo and Salz, is adopted and the performance of the above system is theoretically studied when the intersymbol interference caused by band limitation cannot be neglected. Special consideration has been given to binary frequency-shift keying (FSK) systems. For such systems, the probability of error is given in a closed form."
"Some basic difficulties in the protection of telephone networks against dangerous overvoltage disturbances such as lightning are discussed, and a new method for measuring and recording such transients is presented. The method essentially consists of measuring the analog disturbance signals, converting and coding their temporal values into digital numbers easily available to shift register memories and subsequently recording the results either with a teleprinter for computer analysis and statistical abstracts or with axy-recorder for a human observer. The instrument is capable of recording disturbance amplitudes of 0.1-MHz spectral content linearly with an 300-V interval up to voltages of 5 kV, the sampling rate of the A/D converter used for the recording being adjustable to values of 500 kHz, 1 MHz or 2 MHz. The digital circuits of the instrument use positive logic and are realized for the most part by TTL and MOS technologies."
"Various forms and properties of the maximum-likelihood (ML) bit detector structure for binary signals with intersymbol interference in the presence of additive stationary Gaussian noise are presented and two receiver implementation forms are considered. A simple analytical approximation which also has a heuristic interpretation as a lower bound on the bit probability of error for this detector is presented. The performance of this detector for typical small and moderate degrees of intersymbol interference is presented and compared to other detectors. Both cases indicate that the analytical approximation is quite tight and thus useful in predicting the performance of this highly nonlinear device."
"In a companion paper [1], the rationale for multiaccess broadcast packet communication using satellite and ground radio channels has been discussed. Analytic tools for the performance evaluation and design of uncontrolled slotted ALOHA systems have been presented. In this paper, a Markovian decision model is formulated for the dynamic control of unstable slotted ALOHA systems and optimum decision rules are found. Numerical results on the performance of controlled channels are shown for three specific dynamic channel control procedures. Several practical control schemes are also proposed and their performance compared through simulation. These dynamic control procedures have been found to be not only capable of preventing channel saturation for unstable channels but also capable of achieving a throughput-delay channel performance close to the theoretical optimum."
"This paper presents a unified study of partial-response signaling (PRS) systems and extends previous work on the comparison of PRS schemes. A PRS system model is introduced which enables the investigation of PRS schemes from the viewpoint of spectral properties such as bandwidth, nulls, and continuity of derivatives. Several desirable properties of PRS systems and their relation to system functions are indicated and a number of useful schemes, some of them not previously analyzed, are presented. These systems are then compared using as figures of merit speed tolerance, minimum eye width, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degradation over ideal binary transmission. A new definition of speed tolerance, which takes into account multilevel outputs and the effect of sampling time, is introduced and used in the calculation of speedtolerance figures. It is shown that eye width, a performance measure that has not been used previously in comparing PRS systems, can be calculated analytically in many cases. Exact values as well as bounds on the SNR degradation for the systems under consideration are presented. The effect of precoding on system performance is also analyzed."
"An improved system for speech digitization using adaptive differential pulse-code modulation (ADPCM) is described. The system uses an adaptive predictor, an adaptive quantizer, and a variable length source coding scheme to achieve a 4-5 dB increase in signal-to-noise ratio over previous ADPCM. The increase can be used to improve speech quality at moderate data rates on the order of 16 kbits/s or to retain the same quality and reduce the data rate to 9.6 kbits/s. The latter alternative permits the use of narrow-band channels. The implementation complexity is on the same order as other ADPCM systems."
"A general method for the accurate analysis of the response of a frequency demodulator using feedback (FMFB) to an arbitrary frequency modulated (FM) signal is developed. This approach is employed to determine the FMFB outputs for two specific modulating signals, Gaussian noise, and a single sine wave. The proposed method is then applied to three different FMFB configurations differing in their low-pass filter structure. As a result, generalized curves enabling easy evaluation of the intermodulation (IM) distortion and the harmonic distortion are obtained. When designing the FMFB on the basis of these results, the influence of the relevant system parameters, such as IF filter bandwidth, feedback factor, position of the channel in the baseband, structure of the low-pass filter, etc., on the nonlinear properties of the FMFB can be controlled, simply and in a straightforward manner. The accuracy of the method has been verified in those rare cases for which solutions are already known."
"The objectives and achievements of state-variable methods in linear time-invariant feedback system synthesis are examined. It is argued that the philosophy and objectives associated with eigenvalue realization by state feedback, with or without observers, are highly naive and incomplete in the practical context of control systems. Furthermore, even the objectives undertaken have not really been attained by the state-variable techniques which have been developed. The extremely important factors of sensor noise and loop bandwidths are obscured by the state-variable formulation and have been ignored in the state-variable literature. The basic fundamental problem of sensitivity in the face of significant plant parameter uncertainty has hardly received any attention. Instead, the literature has concentrated primarily on differential sensitivity functions and even those results are so highly obscured in the state-variable formation as to lead to incorrect conclusions. In contrast, the important practical considerations and constraints have been clearly revealed and considered in the transfer function formulation. Differential sensitivity results are simple and transparent. For single input-output systems, there exists an exact design technique for achieving quantitative sensitivity specifications in the face of significant parameter uncertainty, which is optimum in an important practical sense. This problem is much more difficult and has not been completely solved for multivariable systems, but it has at least been realistically attacked by some transfer function methods. Finally, the concepts of controllability and observability so much emphasized in the state-variable literature are examined. It is argued that their importance in this problem class has been greatly exaggerated. On the one hand, transfer function methods can be used to check for their existence. On the other hand, nothing is lost when they are ignored, if the synthesis problem is treated as one with parameter uncertainty by transfer function methods."
"It is shown that Fitts' third-order counterexample to Aizerman's conjecture is false for some values of the parameters."
"The author thanks Dr. Jury for his comments. The auxiliary constraints, based on evaluation of F(1) and F(-1), can be used to shorten the necessary computation, particularly in the singular cases. (In the nonsingular case, evaluation of F(1) and F(-1) is comparable to the steps saved in the tabular form.) It is to be noted, however, that the simplicity of the proposed method and the directness with which results are presented lend themselves to the assimilation of the auxiliary constraints and any other information incidental to a specific problem into the analysis."
"In this paper we interpret and comment on the practical significance of the estimation problems considered in Part I [1] of this series. The problem of implementation of our results is addressed, and the results of a numerical simulation are reported."
"A class of bilinear estimation problems involving single-degree-of-freedom rotation is formulated and resolved. Continuous-time problems are considered here, and discrete-time analogs will be studied in a second paper. Error criteria, probability densities, and optimal estimates on the circle are studied. An effective synthesis procedure for continuous-time estimation is provided, and a generalization to estimation on arbitrary Abelian Lie groups is included. Applications of these results to a number of practical problems including frequency demodulation will be considered in a third paper."
"General error criteria and probability distributions on the circle are studied in connection with estimation by using their Fourier series representations. Conditional probability densities for certain discrete-time folded normal processes, which are analogous to the continuous-time processes associated with the bilinear problems considered in Part I of this series, are computed. An intrinsic physical difference between the discrete-time and continuous-time problems is discussed, and the complexity of the estimation equations in the discrete-time case is analyzed in this setting. Suboptimal sequential filtering schemes are briefly discussed. In addition, Fourier analysis of conditional probability distributions exposes the inherent rich structure in quite general classes of estimation problems on the circle."
"Two characterizations of differentially controllable linear autonomous systems for which the origin is assumed to be a boundary point of the control restraint set are presented. These characterizations extend well-known results which contain the assumption that the origin is interior to the control restraint set. These characterizations are given in terms of the system matrix and the control restraint set. The first theorem applies to arbitrary restraint sets, while the second is restricted to polyhedral regions. The second characterization is the basis for a computational algorithm for the determination of differential controllability to be described in a future paper."
"A new unified approach to the optimal control of discrete linear constant systems is presented. The approach is based exclusively on algebraic properties of polynomials and the synthesis procedure reduces to solving a linear polynomial Diophantine equation. This is believed to be conceptually simpler and computationally superior to existing methods."
"Leverrier's algorithm to find the determinant of (sI_{r}-A) is generalized to the polynomial matrices of arbitrary degree which are in the formI_{r}s^{n} + H_{n-1}s^{n-1} + ... + H_{1}s + H_{0}."
"Given the state space realization\\{A,B,C\\}of a linear time-invariant multivariable dynamic system, a computational algorithm for calculating elements of the corresponding transfer function matrix is presented. The algorithm neither requires cofactor calculation, nor applies any state transformation. The only requirement is calculation of the coefficients of characteristic equations of given matrices. Also, the Fortran subroutine based on the presented algorithm is included."
"A modified approach is presented for the design of Lyapunov model reference adaptive systems. The approach introduces the use of a function of the parameter misalignment, which can be generated with minor demands for additional hardware. Simulation confirms the acceleration in convergence of the system error compared to previous design procedures."
"Some remarks are made on the use of matrix transformations to derive linear matrix equations for locating the characteristic roots of a matrix with respect to some region of the complex plane. Particular attention is devoted to the ellipse. Some unsolved problems are suggested."
"The input-output decoupling control problem for a generalized multivariable linear model, covering most practical situations, is treated for the case where the model involves disturbances in the parameters. A sensitive decoupling controller is derived which maintains the decoupling conditions to first order in the parameter variations, about their nominal values."
"An algorithm to detect unknown discretized rectangular inputs and to estimate the state simultaneously, has been described in this note. The discretized rectangular input is represented by a sequence of equal magnitude inputs to the state. Four alternate hypotheses are formed at every stage of observation and Bayes risks are compared to determine the correct one. A minimum variance estimate of the inputs is used to improve the estimate of the state. Computer results from a numerical example are shown to demonstrate that a possible divergence of the Kalman filter can be prevented by incorporating the detection scheme."
"The author appreciates very much the comments on his work and the commenter's supplement of other important references related to the subject of system order reduction. With respect to the comment on the physical basis of the criterion he describes, the author maintains he has clearly stated in his article that the criterion is based on the philosophy that the low order model L(s) is chosen to approximate the frequency response of the higher order system H(s). On the point of using a vector criterion instead of a scalar criterion, there is no doubt that the former is, in theory, more powerful than the latter. However, the former may easily lead to optimization problems which are more difficult to solve. The author fully agrees with the commentor's view that the \"best model\" is highly dependent on the specific application involved. Therefore, a more logical way for obtaining a specific model is to incorporate into the simplification criterion, a priori, elements measuring the performance of the resulting overall system."
"New, concise, necessary, and sufficient conditions are derived for dynamically decoupling a large class of linear multivariable systems through the employment of constant gain output feedback. The conditions directly imply a constructive procedure for decoupling and reassigning the closed-loop poles, as illustrated by example."
  "Expressions, in a particularly useful form, are given for the new row and column eigenvectors of a linear system after the application of state vector feedback to a single input."
"The linear time-discrete state-space model is generalized from single-dimensional time to two-dimensional space. The generalization includes extending certain basic known concepts from one to two dimensions. These concepts include the general response formula, state-transition matrix, Cayley-Hamilton theorem, observability, and controllability."
"The concept of an elementary null sequence of a linear sequential circuit is introduced. Its properties are used to formulate a necessary and sufficient condition for the invertibility of a linear sequential circuit and to determine the minimal dimension of anL-delay inverse. A general method is given for constructing a minimal dimension inverse which utilizes the state description of the original linear sequential circuit and which applies wheneverL = 0or whenever the next-state map of the linear sequential circuit (LSC) is onto."
"Given an unstable finite-dimensional linear system, the output feedback problem is, first, to decide whether it is possible by memoryless linear feedback of the output to stabilize the system, and, second, to determine a stabilizing feedback law if such exists. This paper shows how this and a number of other linear system theory problems can be simply reformulated so as to allow application of known algorithms for solution of the existence question, with the construction problem being solved by some extension of these known algorithms. The first part of the output feedback problem is solvable with a finite number of rational operations, and the second with a finite number of polynomial factorizations. Other areas of application of the algorithm are described: Stability and positivity tests, low-order observer and controller design, and problems related to output feedback. Alternative computational procedures more or less divorced from the known algorithms are also proposed."
"In a large class of multiloop control systems, many feedback loops are \"closed\" through a time-shared digital computer, using algorithms which require information from sources which are sampled at a rate which is not synchronized with the sampling of the individual \"plants.\" This missynchronization, in conjunction with variations in the computer's task load caused by \"interrupts,\" results in a randomly time-varying delay in the closing of the various feedback loops. Consequently, the dynamics of each controlled \"plant\" in such a system may be modeled by means of a stochastic delay-differential equation. This paper presents some new research results concerning the sample stability (as opposed to statistical, or ensemble stability) of nonlinear stochastic delay-differential equations."
"A configuration and an orderly procedure for the design of linear multivariable control systems are presented. This procedure employs transfer function matrices to specify the system response to set point changes and disturbances. Neither a state-variable formulation nor solution of the matrix Riccati equation are required. The design procedure is illustrated by a simple example involving an unstable system."
"A jump process is best analyzed by investigating the space of all martingales which are generated by the process. The structure of this space of martingales becomes clear in the martingale representation results. Having understood this structure, one can completely resolve the most important problems in 1) modeling and description, 2) detection or hypothesis testing, and 3) filtering of jump processes. Several exercises are worked out to suggest the power of this approach."
"An aquatic ecosystem model for a Georgia farm pond is presented. This pond is managed for sport fishing, for primarily largemouth bass. The pond is fertilized in the spring and periodically throughout the summer in order to cause algal blooms. Such an increase in primary productivity travels up the food chain, directly causing an increase in bass population. This leads to a management scheme in which an optimal control problem can be formulated, the solution of which gives a fertilizer application scheme that maximizes a weighted average standing crop of bass."
"A recursive branching algorithm for multiple-object discrimination and tracking consists of a bank of parallel filters of the Kalman form, each of which estimates a trajectory associated with a certain selected measurement sequence. The measurement sequences processed by the algorithm are restricted to a tractable number by combining similar trajectory estimates, by excluding unlikely measurement/state associations, and by deleting unlikely trajectory estimates. The measurement sequence selection is accomplished by threshold tests based on the innovations sequence and state estimates of each filter. Numerical experiments performed using the algorithm illustrate how the accuracy of the a priori state estimates and trajectory model influences the selectivity of the algorithm."
"The controllability of linear systems with large and small time constants (singularly perturbed systems) is established.

"This paper addresses the application of linear optimal control theory to the least squares functional approximation of linear initial-boundary value problems. The method described produces the optimal approximate solution by the realization of a linear quadratic servo configuration imposed on the Galerkin simulation for the problem. It is shown that appropriate formulation of the servo problem guarantees a stable numerical solution, even when the Galerkin simulation itself is unstable, a situation not uncommon with certain hyperbolic partial differential equations. Theoretical least squares and Galerkin properties are comparatively discussed, and numerical examples demonstrating least squares convergence in the face of Galerkin divergence are presented."
"Necessary and sufficient conditions for the input regularity of a tandem connection of two multivariable systems are given.

"The process presented in this correspondence will generate a Lyapunov function with a negative-definite time derivative for all systems in phase variable form which satisfy the conditions of Lyapunov's first method and one extra continuity condition. For annth-order system, in order to determine a set ofn - 1constants, the method requires a calculation of one inverse of a matrix which is related to the Routh-Hurwitz matrix. The remainder of the constants and the desired Lyapunov function are found by using recursive formulas. Except when the inverse does not exist, the method generates a scalar function which will determine instability by Chetaèv's theorem for those systems where the first method applies. The process is then extended to the case where the first method fails."

The proposed filters retain the computationally attractive recursive structure of the Kalman filter and they approximate well the exact minimum variance filter in cases where either 1) the state noise is Gaussian or its variance small in comparison to the observation noise variance, or 2) the observation noise is Gaussian and the system is one step observable. In both cases, the state estimate is formed as a linear prediction corrected by a nonlinear function of past and present observations. Some simulation results are presented."

The solution given there, based on completing the square, involvesm = n(n-1)/2parameters that are somewhat ambiguously defined. In this correspondence we point out that the ambiguity can be reduced by introducing orthogonal transformations. However, the form that the solution takes reveals that only a very restricted class of problems can be solved by the analytic method of the reference."

 "For annth-order constant system withpoutputs, this short paper shows that the Kalman filter gain can be described bynp -p(p - 1)/ 2difference equations instead of the usualn(n + 1)/2difference equations. This is the minimum number of difference equations required for the solution of the Kalman filter gain. For the special case of stationary processes, this short paper further shows that onlynp-p(p - 1)/2combinations of the system noise covariance enter into determination of the Kalman filter gain. The results have application in filtering and in the quadratic regulator problems."

"A new type of jump resonance is predicted and observed in certain nonlinear feedback control systems. The new jump resonance characteristic is described as a \"frequency island\" due to the fact that a portion of the input-output transfer characteristic is disjoint from the main body. The presence of such frequency islands was predicted by using a sinusoidal describing function characterization of the dynamics of an inertial gyro employing nonlinear ternary rebalance logic. While the general conditions under which such islands are possible has not been examined, a numerical approach is presented which can aid in establishing their presence. The existence of the frequency islands predicted for the ternary rebalanced gyro was confirmed by simulating the nonlinear system and measuring the transfer function. Some recent tests of such gyro rebalance loops tend to corroborate the results presented here."

The detailed structure of the impulse is provided by the asymptotic solution."
"This paper discusses a special optimal control problem having a solution expressible in linear feedback form. The problem structure is characteristic of certain economic investment problems where the control influences the rate of deterioration of a capital good. An example of an economic problem of this type is the determination of the optimal maintenance policy for a housing unit when the effectiveness of maintenance is subject to decreasing returns to scale. Mathematically, the problem is characterized by a dynamic system that is nonlinear with respect to both the state and the control and by a linear objective function. Both the control and the state are restricted to be nonnegative and to lie below given upper bounds. The problem possesses a unique global optimal solution expressible in linear feedback form. The associated control law is derived from the solution of an auxiliary ordinary differential equation that can be solved backward in time. In addition to the linear control law, the problem possesses other important linearity properties. The closed-loop system is linear; that is, although the system itself is nonlinear, when the optimal control law is substituted for the control, the resulting system is linear with respect to the state. And, the optimal return function is affine; that is, the optimal value that can be attained from a given point is an affine function of the value of the state at that time."

For complex systems, traditional techniques for resolving modal responses may be either inapplicable, quite expensive, or numerically unstable.

The method effectively decomposes a system into a set of independent subsystems having the same natural frequencies as the original system."

In particular, an adaptive decision rule with an active learning effect is proposed."
"In this short paper bounding estimators for uncertain systems are developed using the concept of Fuzzy Dynamic Programming. The estimator gives an upper bound to the error for any allowed system parameter variation. A dynamic system is considered where the uncertainty in initial state, additive plant disturbance measurement errors are modeled aS unknown but bounded (UBB). It is further assumed that there is a UBB uncertainty in the system parameters. The estimation problem for a nonlinear system with parameter uncertainty is first formulated as a constrained optimization problem and then using fuzzy dynamic programming the class of bounding estimators is derived. The results are applied to obtain a linear estimator for linear uncertain system. It is shown that such an estimator is precomputable and that it reduces to the optimum filter for a linear system with additive disturbances as the model uncertainty vanishes."

Some sample numerical results are presented, and the interaction of these theoretical results with practical considerations is discussed."
"A new method of approximating the transfer function of a high-order linear system by one of lower order is proposed. Called the \"Routh approximation method\" because it is based on an expansion that uses the Routh table of the original transfer function, the method has a number of useful properties: if the original transfer function is stable, then all approximants are stable; the sequence of approximants converge monotonically to the original in terms of \"impulse response\" energy; the approximants are partial Padé approximants in the sense that the firstkcoefficients of the power series expansions of thekth-order approximant and of the original are equal; the poles and zeros of the approximants move toward the poles and zeros of the original as the order of the approximation is increased. A numerical example is given for the calculation of the Routh approximants of a fourth-order transfer function and for illustration of some of the properties."
"A new algorithm is proposed for estimating the state of a nonlinear stochastic system when only noisy observations of the state are available. The state estimation problem is formulated as a modal-trajectory, maximum likelihood estimation problem. The resulting minimization problem is analogous to the nonlinear tracking problem in optimal control theory. By viewing the system as an interconnection of lower-dimension subsystems and applying the so-called ε-coupling technqiue, which originated in the study of sensitivity of control systems to parameter variations, a near-optimal state estimation algorithm is derived which has the properties that all computations can be performed in parallel at the subsystem level and only linear equations need be solved. The principal attraction of the method is that significant reductions in the computational requirements relative to other approximate algorithms can be achieved when the system is large-dimensional."
"Optimal control theory takes into account constraints such as energy and time economies which are relevant to the understanding of biological design. The versional eye tracking system responsible for the extremely rapid and precise movements called saccades, which occur, for example, during reading, seemed a likely biological system in which to test for time optimality. A homeomorphic detailed physiological model was constructed based on quantitative muscle, neuronal and oculomotor characteristcs. It is a sixth-order nonlinear representation which considers reciprocal innervation and the asymmetrical force-velocity relationship of the agonist-antagonist muscle pair that moves the eye. Simulations were done by digital computer, and responses of the model to first-, second-, and third-order time optimal control signals were observed; the major portions of the response trajectories were essentially the same. The model response was then compared with measured human saccadic eye movements, and it was found that this experimental data agreed most completely with the model driven by first-order time optimal control signals. Additionally, electromyographic studies in man and neurophysiological experiments in animals agree in showing that the nervous controller signals during saccades are also of the first-order type. Thus, we can conclude that the saccadic eye movements studied are accurately depicted by a model that yields time optimal responses."
"Estimation of the state variables of a linear system with parameter uncertainties is performed using an asymptotically unbiased linear minimum-variance recursive estimator in continuous time. Estimates of the parameters can be obtained simultaneously, but are found to be biased. By augmenting additional linear dynamic equations which represent an asymptotic expansion in the unknown parameters, a linear structure is formed which approximates the original nonlinear system. However, the initial conditions and additive process noise are not Gaussian. The convergence properties of the state variance for this expansion are illustrated analytically by a scalar dynamic system. The numerical aspects of this example illustrate the behavior of the actual variance of the error in the state estimate and the predicted error variance as the order of the approximation increases. For the vector state problem, only the multidimensional dynamic system in canonical form with a single output is developed. For ann-dimensional system withnunknown constant parameters, a first-order approximation requiresnadditional linear equations. This approach can be extended to correlated parameter processes."
"This short paper treats the topic of suboptimal linear estimation for systems which have a finite dimensional state vector but a distributed set of observations. Such systems are of some practical interest, and are indeed considerably easier to work with than most distributed parameter systems. The method proposed here is that a filter structure of linear form, driven by a statistic which is a weighted integral of the distributed observation, be used to generate estimates of the state of the system. The filter parameters, and the weighting function for the integral are selected so that the estimate is unbiased and results in minimum mean-square error, subject to the structural constraints."
"A new method for obtaining an on-line unbiased estimate of the parameter vector of linear systems in the presence of additive uncorrelated output noise is described. The method, which is based on the equation error, is developed for continuous variables and then formulated both for continuous and discrete representations. Instead of the conventional least squares approach, the autocorrelation function of the error serves as the cost function to be minimized. It is shown that for comparatively wide-band noise, this cost function yields unique and practically unbiased estimates. On-line identification from system input and output is feasible. Bias suppression as a function of the time-delay in the cost function is demonstrated by numerical examples. Convergence of the estimates is demonstrated by means of simulated continuous and discrete examples."
"A method for obtaining an unbiased estimate of the finiteq-dimensional parameter vector defining a time-invariant linear dynamical system in the presence of noise is described. The system is excited by a stationary mean-square bounded process. The method is based on anr \\geq qparameter \"equation error\" and is presented in continuous time. The equation error input covariance (EEIC) is equated to zero, and the resulting single linear equation havingr > qunknown parameters provides a necessary condition for their unique identification. From it,r - 1additional independent equations are generated. The resultingrlinear independent equations provide the unbiased estimate of the parameter vector in which the excessr - qcomponents vanish. The method does not require the identification of the noise statistics, and it can be applied without a priori assumption of the order of the system's numerator and denominator. Performance of the method is illustrated by simulated examples demonstrating the convergence of the parameter estimate in on-line recursive identification both in open and closed loop."

"A new approach to tracking a maneuvering target is presented. Modeling the randomly varying target as a semi-Markov process and then incorporating the statistics into the design of an adaptive state estimator produced an estimation scheme that greatly reduced the large bias errors that usually appear when a target makes an unexpected, large-scale maneuver."
"This short paper deals with the preview problem, in which a controller can use future information as well as present and past information in deciding the control. The problem of following command signals is considered for the continuous time system. It is assumed that the controller can make use of the finite preview information with respect to command signal from the present timetup to tlatime units in the future. tlais called the preview length and usuallyt_{la} < T, the duration of the problem, which distinguishes the present problem from the optimal tracking problem. It is shown how to utilize the local future information obtained by finite preview to minimize an optimality criterion evaluated over the problem duration. An example is given to show advantages of making use of future information and the existence of an effective preview length."
"The problem of estimating the value of a linear function of the state deterministically is considered for a finite-dimensional linear time-invariant discrete-time system.

"The purpose of this note is to prove a theorem which permits the calculation of the vector b without the necessity of transforming the matrix A into the Jordan form for the Cayley-Hamilton theorem. The only requirement is the calculation of the characteristic polynomial of the matrix A, which may be easily done using the existing computational procedures. The author includes a computer program listing of a subroutine that calculates the coefficients of the n-dimensional vector b. This subroutine makes use of certain standard IBM subroutines, as SMPY, GMPRD, GMSUB, and GMADD, from the IBM 1130 Scitific Subroutine Package, and utilized another subroutine CHEQ described by the author in ibid., vol AC-20, pp. 134-135, Feb. 1975, that calculates the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the matrix A."
"An iterative method is suggested for the solution of the generalized eigenproblem. The iteration is shown to possess cubic order of convergence in the case of distinct eigenvalues. The algorithm appears at its best advantage when good starting values are available; engineering applications where this is so are briefly discussed."
 "It is known that the method of multipliers for constrained minimization can be viewed as a fixed stepsize gradient method for solving a certain, dual problem. In this short paper it is shown that for convex programming problems the method converges globally for a wide range of possible stepsizes. This fact is proved for both cases where unconstrained minimization is exact and approximate. The results provide the basis for considering modifications of the basic stepsize of the method of multipliers which are aimed at acceleration of its speed of convergence. A few such modifications are discussed and some computational results are presented relating to a problem in optimal control."
"This paper is concerned with the class of two-person two-objective decision problems characterized by quadratic cost functions and static information structures. The primitive random variables are assumed to have a priori known but arbitrary probability, distributions with finite second-order moments. For this class of problems, sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of a unique pair of equilibrium solutions. These sufficient conditions are independent of the probabilistic structure of the problem. When the underlying probability, distribution is Gaussian and the observations of the decision makers are linear in the primitive random variables, then it is shown that these unique equilibrium solutions are linear and can be found as the unique solution of a Lyapunov-type matrix equation. For the two special extreme cases known as minimax and team problems, these linear policies constitute a saddle-point solution and a globally-optimal team solution, respectively-thus being in agreement with the existing results in the literature for these two extreme cases."
"This short paper describes the theory and a new algorithm for computing the parameterized solution to a family of minmax problems(MMP):\\min{u\\in U} \\max{i\\in I} J_{i}(u,z), z\\inZ. The fact that MMP may be solved indirectly by looking for the saddle point of\\sum_{i\\in I}c_{i}J_{i} (u,z)enables an important special class of MMP to be reduced by analytic manipulation into a family of inequality constrained programming problems. Over partitioning subsets ofZ, the solution ω to this latter family of problems may be found by solving appropriate equality constrained problems. Two important new results are established: one concerns the continuity of the solution ω inZand the other concerns linearity of the interset boundaries separating the partitioning subsets ofZ. These results are incorporated into the new algorithm which proves to be excellent for obtaining the parameterized solution of certain types of families of minmax problems."
"Attention has been directed to the problem of estimating the state of a linear dynamic system which has correlated noise. The cross correlations between the random vectors affecting the system are assumed unknown. A linear estimator is developed which bounds the corresponding error covariance matrix for any allowed cross correlation between the random disturbances in the plant and/or in the measuring device. The computational requirements are of the order of the corresponding Kalman filter assuming white and uncorrelated plant and measurement noise processes."
"Inventory models with deterministic and stochastic deterioration rates are given. The first model, assuming deterministic deterioration rates, is a hyperbolic equation while the second one assuming a stochastic deterioration rate is reduced to a parabolic equation of the second order. Optimization of these in inventory models when costs are quadratic yields linear feedback replenishment policies. This short paper provides an analytic solution to both problems. The importance of such inventory models is to be found when the demand and value of stored products is also dependent on their quality."

"This short paper extends the existence theory of the stabilizing solution of the discrete algebraic Riccati equation. The main result provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a solution, free of any a priori conditions on the problem data. For the special case of the optimal regulator problem, standard results are recovered as special cases."
"The computational solution of discrete-time stochastic optimal control problems by dynamic programming requires, in most cases, discretization of the state and control spaces whenever these spaces are infinite. In this short paper we consider a discretization procedure often employed in practice. Under certain compactness and Lipschitz continuity assumptions we show that the solution of the discretized algorithm converges to the solution of the continuous algorithm, as the discretization grids become finer and finer. Furthermore, any control law obtained from the discretized algorithm results in a value of the cost functional which converges to the optimal value of the problem."

"A prefiltering version of the Kalman filter is derived for both discrete and continuous measurements. The derivation consists of determining a single discrete measurement that is equivalent to either a time segment of continuous measurements or a set of discrete measurements. This prefiltering version of the Kalman filter easily handles numerical problems associated with rapid transients and ill-conditioned Riccati matrices. Therefore, the derived technique for extrapolating the Riccati matrix from one time to the next constitutes a new set of integration formulas which alleviate ill-conditioning problems associated with continuous Riccati equations. Furthermore, since a time segment of continuous measurements is converted into a single discrete measurement, Potter's square root formulas can be used to update the state estimate and its error covariance matrix. Therefore, if having the state estimate and its error covariance matrix at discrete times is acceptable, the prefilter extends square root filtering with all its advantages, to continuous measurement problems."
"A class of feedback systems, consisting of dynamical non-linear subsystems which arise in many diverse control applications, is analyzed for L2-stability. It is shown that, although a transformation of these systems to the familiar Lur'e configuration does not seem to be possible, a one-to-one correspondence may be effected between the stability properties of these and the Lur'e systems. Interesting stability criteria are developed by exploiting this characteristic."

"We present several new algorithms, and more generally a new approach, to recursive estimation algorithms for linear dynamical systems. Earlier results in this area have been obtained by several others, especially Potter, Golub, Dyer and McReynolds, Kaminski, Schmidt, Bryson, and Bierman on what are known as square-root algorithms. Our results are more comprehensive. They also show bow constancy of parameters can be exploited to reduce the number of computations and to obtain new forms of the Chandrasekhar-type equations for computing the filter gain. Our approach is essentially based on certain simple geometric interpretations of the overall estimation problem. One of our goals is to attract attention to non-Riccati-based studies of estimation problems."

"Necessary conditions for infinite-time linear-quadratic two-player differential games with perfect state information are examined in the light of Willems' work on the algebraic Riccati equation [1]. Necessary conditions for the nonzero-sum game do not always reduce precisely to those of the zero-sum game, when the weighting parameters of the cost index are taken as those of a zero-sum game. Formulation of zero-sum game problems in extended L2-spaces reveals the existence of nonstabilizing but infimal controls, and explicit frequency-domain conditions for existence of solutions and stabilizing solutions are established through the algebraic Riccati equation (ARE)."
  "Given a feedback system containing a linear, time-varying (LTV) plant with significant plant uncertainty, it is required that the system response to command and disturbance inputs satisfy specified tolerances over the range of plant uncertainty. The synthesis procedure guarantees the latter satisfied, providing that they are of the following form. Leth(t',\\tau)be the system response att'= t - \\taudue to a command input\\delta(t - \\tau), andh_{\\tau}(s)=\\int \\liminf{0}\\limsup{infty}h(t',\\tau)e^-{st'}dt'is the Laplace transform ofh(t',\\tau). There is given a setM_{\\tau}(\\omega)=\\{m_{\\tau}(\\omega)\\} , \\omega \\in[0, \\infty), with the requirement that|h_{\\tau}(j\\omega)| \\in M_{\\tau}(\\omega), over the range of plant uncertainty. The disturbance response tolerances are of the same form, in response to a disturbance input\\delta (t- \\tau). The acceptable response setM_{\\tau}(\\omega)can depend on τ. The design emerges with a fixed pair of LTV compensation networks and can be considered applicable to time-domain response tolerances, to the extent that a set of bounds on a time function can be translated into an equivalent set on its frequency response. The design procedure utilizes only time-invariant frequency response concepts and is conceptually easy to follow and implement. At any fixed τ, the time-varying system is converted into an equivalent time-invariant one with plant uncertainty, for which an exact solution is available, with \"frozen\" time-invariant compensation. Schauder's fixed-point theorem is used to prove the equivalence of the two systems. The ensemble over τ of the time-invariant compensation gives the final required LTV compensation. It is proven that the design is stable and nonresonant for all bounded inputs."
"A simple formulation is given for the notion of feedback between two stationary stochastic processes in terms of the canonical representation of the joint process. The definition presented here has an equivalent formulation in terms of filtering theory, and provides statistical criteria for the detection of feedback.

"For a discrete-time rational spectral density matrix\\Phi(z), the relationship between the factorizations\\Phi(z) = Z(z) + Z^{T} (z^{-1})and\\Phi(z) = W(z)QW^{T}(z), in terms of minimal state space realizations ofZ(z)andW(z), are derived in a straightforward way, without resorting to the use of the bilinear transformation. The obvious application of this result to performing a spectral factorizafion of\\Phi(z)is discussed."
"Using the \"partitioning\" approach to estimation and control, robust and fast computational algorithms for the solution of discrete Riccati equations (RE) are presented. The algorithms have a decomposed or partitioned structure that results through partitioning the total computation interval into subintervals and solving for the RE in each subinterval with zero initial conditions for each subinterval Thus, effectively, the RE solution over the whole interval has been decomposed into a set of elemental piece-wise solutions which are both simple as well as completely decoupled from each other and as such computable in either a parallel or serial processing mode. Further, the overall solution is given in terms of a simple recursive operation on the elemental solutions. The partitioned algorithms are theoretically interesting as well as computationally attractive."

"The primary difficulties of both the time-domain switch decomposition method and the frequency-domain decomposition method are overcome by introducing certain matrix operators and performing spectral factorization of resulting matrices of polynomials in thez-transform variable. Topological operations of the switch-decomposition method are simplified. This new approach eliminates the need to solve a system of equations with rational polynomial coefficients such as arises in the frequency-decomposition method. The determination of a multirate sampled-data system's characteristic polynomial no longer requires the evaluation of a determinant of rational polynomial elements. New results on obtaining modifiedz-transforms from standardz-transforms at a faster rate and vice versa are presented."

"This study deals with ways of curtailing the vapid growth of cancer cell populations. The performance functional that measures the size of the population at the terminal time as well as the control effort is devised. With use of the discrete maximum principle, the Hamiltonian for this problem is determined and the condition for optimal solutions are developed. The optimal strategy is shown to be a bang-bang control. It is shown that the optimal control for this problem must be on the vertices of anN-dimensional cube contained in theN-dimensional Euclidean space. An algorithm for obtaining a local minimum of the performance function in an orderly fashion is developed. Application of the algorithm to the design of antitumor drug andX-irradiation schedule is discussed."
"For a class of constant linear dynamic systems with unmeasurable disturbances, geometric necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of a state-feedback controller that localizes the disturbances and simultaneously assigns the closed-loop poles or decouples the closed-loop system. These conditions are simple, intuitively appealing, and closely related to the known necessary and sufficient conditions for the separate problems to be solvable alone. Furthermore, it is shown that for these combined problems and for simultaneous disturbance localization and stabilization problems no additional flexibility is afforded by using dynamic compensation instead of static compensation except for the combined problem of disturbance localization and decoupling where the additional flexibility is derived from that for the decoupling problem alone. Under a standard rank assumption, it is established that the combined problem of simultaneously localizing the disturbances, assigning the poles and decoupling the system has no solution. Separate necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the existence of a solution to the combined problem of disturbance localization, stabilization, and decoupling."
"The theory of observers is generalized from finite dimensional linear systems to abstract linear systems characterized by semigroups on Banach spaces. Sufficient conditions are given for both identity and reduced-order observers to exist for the abstract system. It is shown that the spectrum of a closed-loop control system using an observer is the union of the spectrum of the observer and the spectrum of the closed-loop system with state feedback. The observer theory for the abstract system is used to show that observability is a sufficient condition for the existence of an observer for a system modeled by a linear functional differential equation."
"A canonical realization for a partial sequence of real, constant matrices is obtained by identifying the system invariants defined by Popov [11]. Further, the case where the resulting realization must also be stable is considered. The example used by Tether [5] is solved, and the results compared with those of Tether [5] and Ackermann [12]."
"The general problem of pole assignment in a linear, time-invariant multivariable system via output feedback is considered. It is shown that given a controllable-observable system (C,A,B) in whichA \\in R^{n \\times n}, rankB = m, rankC = r, then for almost all (B,C) pairs,\\min (n,m + r-1)poles can be assigned arbitrarily close to\\min (n, m + r-1) specified symmetric values by using output feedback."
"The cost-performance tradeoff problem associated with a multilayer control system for controlling a class of static, nonlinear, multivariable systems is considered. The multilayer control system has a number of layers of control functions each of which updates different subsets of the control variables at different costs. A favorable cost-performance tradeoff is achieved by determining at each control decision time which subset of the control variables is to be updated. In this paper, we present a mathematical model which describes the operation of the multilayer control system. Also we show that the problem of determining a decision rule (policy) which results in an optimal cost-performance tradeoff can be formulated as a problem in Markovian decision processes. Consequently, an optimal policy can be identified by solving a linear program. In order to reduce the computational effort required for identifying the optimal policy, a class of parameterized policies is introduced based on a measure of deviation of the disturbance. This approach provides a designer with a practical method of determining a control policy which achieves a favorable cost-performance tradeoff. An example is given for demonstrating a possible application to process control."
"The well-known graphical describing function procedure can be simply modified to provide a completely reliable method for predicting whether or not certain kinds of nonlinear feedback system can oscillate. The modified method is easy to use and quantifies, in a natural way, the usual intuitive ideas about describing function reliability. In addition to the usual graphs, the user has to draw a band which measures the amount of uncertainty introduced by the approximations inherent in the method; in return for this extra work, the method gives error bounds for oscillation predictions, as well as ranges of frequency and amplitude over which oscillation is impossible. The main restriction is that the nonlinear element must be single valued and have bounded slope."
"In this paper it is shown how some basic ideas from system theory and differential geometry can be used to establish some new results on the existence of periodic motion in automomous feedback systems.

"This short paper deals with the problem of pole assignment with incomplete state observation. It is shown that if the system is controllable and observable, and ifn \\leq r + m - 1, an almost arbitrary set of distinct closed-loop poles is assignable by gain output feedback, wheren, r, andmare the numbers of state variables, inputs and outputs, respectively. This result improves considerably the ones obtained so far about this problem. Different from the conventional approach using the characteristic equation, an approach based on the properties of the eigenspaces of the closed-loop dynamics is used in this short paper, which gives a new light on the various problems in the linear system theory. It is also shown, as a direct consequence of this result, that the minimum order of the dynamic compensator required for almost arbitrary pole assignment of overall closed-loop system is not greater thann - m - r + 1."

"Simple and easy to use conditions are developed which guarantee global stability of two linearly interconnected nonlinear systems. The conditions consist of two scalar frequency response conditions of Popov type on the linear dynamical subsystems and inequalities involving the sector bounds and parameters in the problem; the inequalities have a simple graphical interpretation in terms of the product of the interconnection coefficients. Examples with particular numerical values are presented to illustrate application of the results."
"An outlier is a data point that contains no information about the system to be estimated. A procedure is developed, using a Bayesian cost criterion, to detect and eliminate outliers from a data base and at the same time provide estimates of the state of a dynamical system. The approach is applied to a Gauss-Markov discrete-time system and to a parameter estimation problem. For the latter case, exact solutions of estimator bias and convariance are obtained and conditions for filter divergence are discussed. The approach in this paper differs from others in that a maximum a posteriori estimate is obtained over long block lengths of data so that clustering schemes can be employed."
"This paper proves the theorem that permits calculation of the order of the minimal realization of a system described by the Jordan form state equations.

"A multivariable feedback system y(s)=G(s)x(s), x(s) = u(s)- F(s)y(s) is treated where G(s) ≜ (gkl(s)) is the transfer function matrix of a plant and F(s) ≜ diag(f1(s),...,fn(s)) is that of a controller. A new bound for the transfer function hj(s) that relates yj(s) to uj(s) when fj(s)≡ 0 is given. The main result reads |hj(s)- gjj(s)| < aj(s) if |fk(s)-1+ gkk(s)| > ak(s) for k = 1,... ,n; k≠j. Here, A ≜ diag(a1(s),...,an(s)) is a diagonal matrix which makes A-B a semi-M-matrix where B ≜ (bkl) is given by bkk=0, bkl= |gkl(s)| (k≠l). A similar result is also obtained for the inverse transfer function."
"This short paper discusses the problem of controlling stochastic nonlinear systems where the end-time of the process has to be determined on-line. Since the optimal solution is not obtainable, a dual control method is developed for this class of problems. The algorithm has the property that the control, which is restricted to be causal, utilizes the statistical description of the future observations, i.e., it is of the closed-loop, rather than feedback type. This property allows the controller to enhance the estimation via the dual effect and thus improve the overall performance. The method is illustrated by applying it to an interception problem. Simulation studies on this particular problem provide further insight into how the dual effect of the control can be utilized in nonlinear problems. They also indicate the potential value of the algorithm presented here to practical problems."
"Design equations are developed for an optimal limited state feedback controller problem. These equations are developed for the stochastic case, in which both plant noise and measurement noise may be present, and for the case of a dynamic compensator. Four possible approaches to the solution of the nonlinear design equations are described. A fourth-order example illustrates some of the difficulties associated with the solution of these equations and suggests additional areas for study."
"This paper studies the necessary and sufficient conditions for a pth-order observer to observe linear functions of the states of a linear dynamical system. The conditions are a set of multivariable polynomial equations which must be satisfied for some variable set in order for a pth-ncder observer to exist. It is possible to test for the existence of such a variable set in a finite number of steps via decision methods and thereby to construct an observer with the aid of polynomial factorization. To minimize the computational effort, the necessary and sufficient conditions are expressed in terms of the minimum number of variables."

After introducing Walsh functions in the beginning we develop an operational matrix for solving state equations. Then using the operational matrix we solve the piecewise constant gains problem."
"The techniques of optimal control and optimization are applied to a practical problem of reducing energy consumed by the Montreal Metro (subway) system. The problem considered is the determination of tunnel trajectories in the \"equivalent\" vertical plane when trains traveling in both directions must follow the same trajectory. The problem is first formulated as a control problem with control and state constraints. Then, under certain simplifying assumptions, an heuristic method employing a direct search algorithm is presented and used in the trajectory optimization. The trajectories are optimized to reduce the sum of the energy consumed by the trains traveling in both directions on the trajectory. The results show an average reduction of 7.73 percent in energy consumption as compared with existing trajectories. The trajectories found using the method presented here will be followed in future tunnel construction."

"This paper is one of a series in which performance bounds are derived for state estimation and regulation problems employing mean-square criteria. The systems considered are partially observed finite-dimensional continuous-time stochastic processes driven by additive white Gaussian noise. The particular systems to which the bounds apply are those which, when modeled by Itô differential equations, contain drift (\\dot{dt}) coefficients which are, to within a uniformly Lipschitz residual, jointly linear in the system state and externally applied control. The bounds derived in the complete series of papers include both upper and lower bounds for state estimation and for a quadratic regulator problem. The upper bounds pertain to the performance of some simple, almost linear designs reminiscent of the designs which are optimal in the linear case. The lower bounds pertain to the optimum performance attainable within a broad class of admissible control laws. The present paper treats the lower bound for filtering. The estimation performance bounds are independent of the control law, giving a particularly simple form to the control performance bounds which are developed in a companion paper. All the bounds converge with vanishing nonlinearity (vanishing Lipschitz constants) to the known optimum performance for the limiting linear system. Consequently, the bounds are asymptotically tight and the simple designs studied are asymptotically optimal with vanishing nonlinearity."
"Abstract--The design of a minimal order stable observer and a minimal order observer with arbitrary poles that estimates a vector linear function of the state of a multivariable system is discussed. It is shown that both problems can be solved in a straightforward manner using partial realization theory, and several new results are given. These include a strong bound for the dimension of the minimal order stable observer and a simple necessary condition to design the minimal order observer with arbitrary poles that estimates a vector linear function of the state of a multiple-output system. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for designing a minimal order observer with arbitrary poles for the case of estimating a vector linear function of the state of a single-output system and the case of estimating a scalar linear function of the state of a multiple-output system. A procedure to carry out the design in each of these cases is described. No restrictions whatsoever (except stability) are placed on the possible values of the observer poles. A significant observation of this paper is that the dynamics of the observer are constrained (in all cases) only by the gain matrix in the feedback law to be estimated and the output structure of the given system."
"This short paper discusses the development of realistic models for human controllers in man-machine systems that can be used to predict changes in overall system performance under stress conditions. An input-output pursuit-type feed-forward model for the human controller is identified. Parameter-identification under normal and stress conditions is carried out using a maximum likelihood procedure. Results presented show that the identification algorithm is very successful in estimating the parameters of the model. However, it is not possible to make significant inferences about performance decrements due to stress because of an insufficient data base."
"The design of a fixed, linear, dynamic controller for a linear system subjected to random disturbances and additive measurement noise is examined. The objective is to achieve satisfactory performance with controllers of order significantly lower than that of a Kalman filter or Luenberger observer. Matrices which define the controller are chosen to minimize the steady-state average of a quadratic function of the control and state variables. Necessary conditions which the gains must satisfy in order to minimize this criterion are developed."
"Completely unknown but deterministic (or Fisher-nnknown) inputs often occur in practice and are approximated by Gauss-Markov processes in applying Kalman-Bucy filtering results. In this paper, the exact filtering equations for such inputs are presented in terms of an information-form filter. The equations are obtained by a limit procedure from the corresponding equations for discrete-time systems. Using duality arguments, the necessary and sufficient conditions for singular control problems are shown to follow from these results."
 "The use of Lyapunov functions in the design of a fixed controller for model reference systems results in a bang-bang control. The motion in the neighborhood of the switching surface is analyzed and conditions are found that ensure stable trajectories. It is shown that the Lyapunov design verifies these conditions. The last part of the trajectories appears to be a sliding motion, forcing the plant to track the model. The results are illustrated by a simulation example."
"This note deals with an estimation problem arising in a specific microwave landing (MLS) flight-control system. Two solutions are discussed, the first of which is an example of a closed-form nonlinear Bayesian estimator while the second indicates that, in special cases, a deterministic modeling of the uncertainties may be more effective and simpler than a stochastic one."

"This note considers the computation of the derivatives of the matrix exponential function with respect to parameters such that the dependence of the matrix upon the parameters is nontrivial. A straightforward means of evaluating such derivatives is developed by recognizing that the matrix exponential function satisfies a differential equation, and an efficient means of evaluating the resulting integral is presented. Applications are indicated."
"Two examples are given which show that one should be very cautious when using an appealing numerical approach to solve differential games or optimal control problems with more than one control variable. This numerical procedure essentially reduces the problem into a number of subproblems in each of which the optimization is considered with one control variable only."

"Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived under which a given set of linear functionals assume unique values over the solution set of a linear equation; the latter property is referred to as partial uniqueness. The usefulness of the conditions obtained for partial uniqueness is demonstrated by applying them to various problems of observability and input identifiability of linear dynamical systems."

"In order to estimate the state of a linear time-invariant multivariable system by using a Luenberger observer, it is generally assumed that all system inputs are measurable. This correspondence presents a simple and useful procedure for the construction of minimal-order state estimators for systems with unmeasurable disturbances."
"A controllability criterion is suggested referring to the numerator coefficients of the input/state transfer functions. The criterion is comparable to the usual one from a computational point of view, and it seems to be useful from a didactic point of view because it can be proved in a very simple way."
"A recursive algorithm for parametric identification of discrete-time systems known as Panuska's method, the approximate maximum likelihood method or the extended matrix method, is analyzed. Making use of recently developed theory for asymptotic analysis of recursive stochastic algorithms, dynamic systems, and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) processes are constructed for which this algorithm does not converge. The manner in which the counterexamples are constructed yields insight into the algorithm and provides ideas how to improve the convergence properties."
 "A class of non-Gaussian estimation problems is equivalent to minimax and L1curve fitting. The curve fit is shown to be algebraically dual to optimization of a positive semidefinite quadratic form with linear inequalities, which is solved by a fast quadratic program based on Graves' simplex algorithm. An example compares the performance of this estimator with the (suboptimal) minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimations generated by quadratic curve fitting."
"This paper will consider the problem of using output data to identify a constant, multivariable, stochastic linear system which has unknown dimension, system matrices, and noise covariances. In order to obtain consistent parameter estimates, we use the innovations representation for the output process, in which the system matrices are chosen in a certain (invariant) canonical form. A systematic procedure is described for estimating the system structure and parameters of the innovations representation. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the identification method. A large-sample error analysis of the identification method is also given."

"The controller characterization result obtained in the above-named article [ibid., VOI. AC-17. pp. 621-630, Oct. 1972] via equations (64) and (66) is not complete; on applying the same argument as used there, a more general expression is obtained for (66) and presented here."

"A new model for identifying nonlinear systems is presented. The multipath structure with each path consisting of a polynomial followed by linear dynamics is a direct extension of the single path Hammerstein model. An iterative algorithm for obtaining the dynamics from finite length input and noisy output data records is presented and shown to converge for a class of inputs including colored Gaussian processes. Computer simulations demonstrate the feasibility of the model and algorithm."

"A combination of dominant-eigenvalues and Padé approximation methods is proposed for the reduction of a high degree multivariable system. The reduced models so derived are equivalent to those derived by the method in [7]. However, it is computationally much simpler and never fails to produce reduced models. Further it is equally applicable to systems with the number of inputs different from the number of outputs."
"Operating boiling water reactor designs have incorporated dynamic compensation in the pressure control system, tuned to optimally attenuate the acoustic modes of the main streamlines."
 "An analysis is provided of the effects of steam pipe acoustics on the control of steam pressure in boiling water reactors. A model is developed for the process which encompasses the reactor vessel, the main steam piping, the bypass system piping, the turbine throttle valve and bypass valve, and associated control equipment. It is shown that instability of the closed loop can occur unless the acoustics are suitably accounted for. Moreover, it is shown that although classical compensation schemes may lead to adequate controller designs in some situations, such regulators are limited in their ability to provide fast pressure recovery and can thus contribute to undesirable oscillations between reactor pressure and water level control loops. State variable methods are shown to lead to fundamentally different control structures which eliminate this difficulty but other considerations are noted which can limit their application. These are, however, minor when compared to the benefits attainable."
"This paper summarizes a study of self-contained navigation system accuracies for high altitude orbital missions projected through 1985. It is found that root-sum-square (RSS) satellite position errors as low as a few hundred feet are obtainable with range measuring systems. Totally autonomous, nonradiating systems are operationally more attractive, and some promising candidates in this category give RSS position errors from about one-half to a few miles, depending on the orbit. The extended Kalman filter and extensive Monte Carlo simulations are used as the basic analysis tools. Favorable comparisons between covariance analysis and Monte Carlo results are reported. Time-average statistics are also found to provide useful figures of merit."
"In this paper, we study feedback stabilization of a class of distributed systems governed by partial differential equations of parabolic type and its application to constructing a state estimator for asymptotic state identification. It is proved that, when a controller (an observation) can be arbitrarily constructed, observability (controllability) of the system is necessary and sufficient for stabilizing the system so that it has an arbitrarily large damping constant. As an application of this result, it is shown that a state estimator can be constructed, the output of which approaches asymptotically the real state of the system with an arbitrary convergence rate."
"Optimal control of a two-core coupled nuclear reactor system is considered. The mathematical description of this system leads to an eighth-order nonlinear time delay model. This model is written in such a way that when a scalar parameter is perturbed, it reduces to a second-order model without time delays. Using the recently developed singular perturbation theory, an approximate solution valid for the eighth-order time delay model is obtained by solving only reduced-order models. Computational advantages of this method over the second variation method are discussed."

"A feedback gain will be discussed which can easily be computed and stabilizes a discrete constant linear system. The results extend the work of Kleinman [1]. In particular, the requirement of nonsingularity will be removed for single-input systems, and another similar control will be given which stabilizes a multi-input system even when the system has a singular matrix."

"This short paper treats one aspect of the identification of state-derivative-coupled systems, such asM\\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t) + w(t)whereM \\neq I, andMis invertible. This equation can also be written as\\dot{x}(t) = F_{1}x(t) + F_{2}u(t) + \\omega(t). We assume that reduced form parameters (F_{1}, F_{2}) are identifiable and develop a sequence of tests for establishing the identifiability of structural parameters (M, A, B) from (F_{1} F_{2}). The tests are constructive, in that they not only can be used to ascertain the identifiability of (M, A, B); but, if (M, A, B) are not identifiable, can also indicate corrective actions to be taken so that (M, A, B) are identifiable."
"The results of a previous paper [1] on the regulation and tracking of a servomechanism problem are extended to include control inputs on the outputs of the system and for the case that the state is not available for measurement."
"This short paper is concerned with computational methods for solving optimization problems with a vector-valued index function (vector optimization). It uses vector optimization as a tool for analyzing static control problems with performance and parameter sensitivity indices. The first part of this short paper presents a new computational method, the goal attainment method, which overcomes some of the limitations and disadvantages of methods currently available. The second part presents an integrated, multiobjective treatment of performance and sensitivity optimization based on a vector index approach. A numerical example in electric power system control is included, with analysis and results demonstrating the use of the goal attainment method and application of the approach to performance and sensitivity optimization."

"The problem of designing closed-loop policies for identification of multiinput-multioutput linear discrete-time systems with random time-varying parameters is considered in this paper using a Bayesian approach. A sensitivity index gives a measure of performance for the closed-loop laws. The computation of the optimal laws is shown to be nontrivial, an exercise in stochastic control, but open-loop, affine, and open-loop feedback optimal inputs are shown to yield tractable problems. Numerical examples are given. For time-invariant systems, the criterion considered is shown to be related to the trace of the information matrix associated with the system."

"In an Editorial in the June 1975 issue of this TRANSACTIONS, Editor Stephen Kahne suggested that brief statements regarding trends in particular areas of interest to our community be made by appropriate Associate Editors. The current author's response to that suggestion was enthusiastic enough to get the assignment to produce the first element of a series that we hope to be an important contribution to the efforts of the Information Dissemination Committee to improve communications with TRANSACTIONS readers. It is argued that there are many opportunities for the application of automatic control techniques, both for the improved performance of individual vehicles and for the efficient management of multiple vehicle systems. In both cases, the potential payoff is enormous. After explaining the impact of such improvements, the remainder of this discussion is concerned with the opportunities and challenges associated with the management of multiple vehicle systems, for it is in this area that further advances in the development of automatic control theory will be required to maximize the benefits associated with the automation of these systems."
"A control law u0guaranteeing a prespecified terminal error is found subject to bounded uncertainties in the initial state. In the general case, this u0is described by a finite-dimensional minimax pointy_{0}^{*}. A refinement of this result is given for the case when the set of possible initial states is polyhedral convex."
"This note treats problems of decentralized control of stochastic discrete-time dynamic systems with one-step-delay sharing information structure. It is shown that, by applying dynamic programming techniques, the problem can be decomposed into several static team problems. For LQG cases, this approach gives an optimal control policy which consists of an optimal control term under the classical information structure and a correction term due to one-step-delay information structure."

"Quadriphase modulation of microwave or mm-wave carriers involves the rapid shifting of the phase of the carrier between one of four orthogonal positions by binary data included on two parallel data streams. The received quadriphase (QPSK) carrier can be demodulated by mixing this carrier with an appropriately phased local oscillator signal in a doubly-balanced mixer. One of the problems in demodulation of quadriphase carriers is the generation of the local oscillator having carrier frequency and phase information. This can be accomplished either at RF from the incoming QPSK carrier or at baseband by comparing the crosstalk associated with the two demodulated data streams. This paper will describe the applicable microwave technologies utilizing special quadrupler frequency multipliers which provide microwave carrier reconstruction which facilitates the demodulation of data information from the carrier."

"Microwave measurements lend themselves to automation because many readings and much computation is often needed to achieve reasonable accuracies. The expense of automated microwave measurements has limited their widespread use for general measurements. However, an international standard for instrument interfaces, more off-the-shelf programmable instruments, and the advent of inexpensive calculator controllers will dramatically increase the utilization of automated microwave measurement techniques."

"Exact, general, open-wire-line equivalent circuits for tapped-line combline and interdigital arrays are derived using a combination of graph- transformations and induction. A significant feature of the equivalent circuits is that they do not require commensurate length sections. The equivalent circuit for tapped-line interdigital arrays is utilized to develop new design equations for tapped-line interdigital filters. Computed responses for five and twenty percent bandwidth designs show considerably improved VSWR's compared to designs based on previous procedures."

The rather complex pole-zero structure of single-section inhomogeneous coupled-line filters permits great flexibility in designing multi-section filters. Very sharp transitions between pass- and stop bands are possible as well as large stopband to passband width ratios."

A trial 8-way combiner with 20% bandwidth at a center frequency of 1.15 GHz fully verified the new design concept."

"The Federal Government encourages U.S. citizens to save for retirement by offering tax incentives. Substantial savings to an individual can result if he joins a qualified retirement plan.

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 has changed the ground rules. Some of these rules were strongly supported by IEEE, others were proposed by IEEE and written into the Act as a result of testimony presented by IEEE."

"The avalanche process in an IMPATT-diode is inherently noisy.

"The avalanche process in an IMPATT-diode is inherently noisy. On the other hand the IMPATT-diode has the highest C.W. power capabilities, compared with the other active solid-state microwave devices. Therefore, several applications can only be realized using IMPATT- devices and must be designed in such a way that the noise is acceptable. Let us first consider the noise generation in an IMPATT-diode. The noise is due to the random character of the avalanche process and is, in principle, shot noise. However, due to the large multiplication factor this shot noise is amplified. Every deviation from equilibrium will grow at a fast rate, depending on the intrinsic response time."
"In a communications system, the noise performance answer of most significance is the signal to noise ratio at the baseband output from a receiver. This is reflected in the form of the noise specification for components used in communications service. This is a ratio of noise in a 3 kHz bandwidth to the power in a test tone which causes 200 kHz deviation in the transmitter. This 3 kHz bandwidth is swept through the baseband region--typically 50 kHz to 5 mHz."

Simple relationships between easily measurable amplifier properties and pump noise power are given which enable the performance of any combination of pump and amplifier under the two signal conditions to be predicted. A method which simultaneously eliminates the small-signal effect and reduces the large-signal effect to an acceptable level is proposed and demonstrated to be a practical solution."

"The NAVSTAR Global Positioning System is a satellite-based navigation system that will provide extremely accurate three-dimensional position fixes and timing information to properly equipped users anywhere on or near the earth. User positioning requires the determination of the times of transit for satellite generated signals to reach the user.

"This Special Issue of the IEEE TRANSACTIONS on Microwave Theory and Techniques is devoted to two closely related fields: integrated optics and optical waveguides. The subject of optical waveguides is pertinent to optical communications by means of glass fibers and to the circuitry of integrated optics. The theory of optical waveguides has reached a stage of relative maturity while integrated optics is still in a relatively early stage of its development. Fiber waveguides seem to have a fairly secure future since the spectacular successes of glass fiber research almost certainly ensure their application in optical communications systems. Already there are examples of experimental military applications of optical fibers and their use in the telephone system is anticipated."

"The utilization of the nearly ideal heterojunction that can be achieved between GaAs and AL/sub x/ Ga/sub 1-x/As to confine both light and electrical carriers has lead to the evolution of several new classes as injection lasers with very low room-temperature current-density thresholds for lasing (/spl lsim/ 1000 A/cm/sup 2/), and structures whose operation can be more readily understood than the earlier homostructure lasers. These are as follows: the single-heterostructure (SH) laser which utilizes one heterojunction to confine light and carriers on one side of the structure; the double-heterostructure (DH) laser in which both carriers and light are confined to the same region; and the separate-confinement-heterostructure (SCH) laser in which the carriers are separately confined to a narrow region within the optical cavity. A state-of-the-art description of these lasers and some of the mode structures encountered in their operation is presented. Recent work is described which permits the growth of low-strain heterostructures with heterojunctions between GaAs and Al/sub x/Ga/sub 1-x/As/sub1-y/P/sub y/ strain reduction from mismatch and bonding of contacts has resulted in lasers which, while maintaining very low room-temperature current thresholds, also have very long lifetimes (> 10/sup 5/ h) for continuous operation."
"While the major objective of integrated optics at the visible-light and near-infrared wavelength is to provide thin-film components to obtain switching, modulation, source, detection, etc., for fiber-optics communication, the immediate objective of integrated optics at the 10.6-mu m wavelength is to improve the operational characteristics of conventional bulk components via guided-wave technology. This paper will discuss the properties of the waveguides, the modulators, the passive components, and the waveguide laser that have been made to date. The most significant advancement is probably guided-wave modulation. Both the analysis and the initial experimental measurements indicate that pi-phase or 100-percent amplitude UHF-VHF modulation could be obtained with only a few hundred watts of modulation drive power. Microwave modulation has also been experimentally demonstrated. Naturally, this is only an interim report. Many exciting developments will be obtained in the future."

At this writing, experimental confirmation has been hampered by lack of success optically contacting two dissimilar materials."
"Light in a tapered thin-film optical waveguide radiates into the substrate because the waveguide mode in the taper becomes cut off. Our measurement of the radiation pattern shows that the light emerges from the taper as a narrow beam with an angular width of only 2/spl deg/-4/spl deg/. We have studied the problem based on ray optics and based on a wave theory of radiation modes. We also have demonstrated a film-to-fiber coupler in which an optical fiber collects all the light emerging from the taper."

A computer analysis shows that this type of coupler has greatly improved tolerance properties and does not, in particular, suffer from the severe tolerance restriction placed on velocity synchronism in conventional uniform couplers."
"Coupling from a multimode to a single-mode linear waveguide using horn-shaped structures is investigated. The approximate coupling efficiency is found by numerical solution of coupled-mode equations that apply to the reciprocal problem, i.e., to the problem of propagation in an expanding horn. A coupling efficiency in excess of 90 percent is calculated when coupling is from the principal mode of a sample 50-mu m-wide multimode waveguide to a 3-mu m-wide single-mode guide (lambda = 0.63mu m). This efficiency results from a uniformly tapered horn whose length is on the order of 2 mm. The length can be decreased by using a shaped coupling region. One such region is found to result in a coupling length of approximately 1.6 mm."
"A numerical method based upon invariant imbedding and the transverse impedahce concept is applied to the problem of calculating various properties of inhomogeneous slab waveguides.

"The round dielectric waveguide exhibits a surprising variety of characteristics that are not accurately inferable from the slab model. The forceful effort of recent years has grately extended the knowledge of these structures and added new and exciting modifications. An attempt to unify these results in a simplified picture is made.

Some of the problems discussed are cross sectional loss variations, various core index profiles and the tolerances required in their preparation, the necessary cladding thickness, directional changes, and sources of mode coupling affecting signal distortion and loss."

"The propagation of electromagnetic waves along open periodic, dielectric waveguides is formulated here as a rigorous and exact boundary-value problem. The characteristic field solutions are shown to be of the surface-wave or leaky-wave type, depending on the ratio of periodicity to wavelength (d/lambda). The dispersion curves and the space-harmonic amplitudes of these fields are examined for both TE and TM modes. Specific numerical examples are given for the cases of holographic layers and for rectangularly corrugated gratings; these show the detailed behavior of the principal field components and the dependence of waveguiding and leakage characteristics on the physical parameters of the periodic configuration."
"The reflection of a locally plane wave from a curved interface between two nonabsorbing dielectric media is investigated. Our analysis is applicable to an interface of general shape, defined at each point by the two principal radii of curvature. When the wave is incident from the denser medium at angles greater than the critical angle it is only partially reflected, due to a form of electromagnetic tunneling. Generalized Fresnel transmission coefficients and an extension of Snell's law are derived to account for this transmission into the less dense medium. Ray tracing can then be applied to determine such phenomena as the bending losses in optical slab waveguides, and the curvature loss of skew rays within straight optical waveguides of circular cross section."
"The radiation from the fundamental mode propagating around curved dielectric rod transmission lines is investigated experimentally with microwave frequencies. Three methods are used to determine the attenuation by radiation: measuring the insertion loss of bends, measuring the Q-factor of ring resonators, and measuring the Q-factor of sections of curved dielectric rod transmission lines terminated by large reflecting plates. The attenuation is found to depend mainly on the combination R lambda/sub 0//sup 2/ / r/sub 0//sup 3/ where R is the radius of curvature, lambda/sub 0/ the free space wavelength and r/sub 0/ a measure of the transverse field extent of the HE/sub 11/ mode. The experimental results are compared with theoretical predictions of other authors. The measured values of the attenuation constant are found to be smaller than the theoretical values. The distribution of the electromagnetic field near bends is recorded using a semiautomatic field plotter. From the field pictures, it can be concluded that the curved dielectric waveguide radiates tangentially from the outer side. The results presented will also be useful for understanding the mechanism of radiation from bent optical waveguides."
"The two-dimensional problem of excitation of an inhomogeneous dielectric layer by a Gaussian beam is considered, with emphasis on useful representations that treat the field either in terms of multiple reflections or in terms of guided modes. A recently developed method is employed whereby the beam fields are generated from line source fields by assigning a complex value to the source coordinates. When applied to the asymptotic solution for the line source field, this procedure furnishes a simple and quantitative relation between line-source-excited ray optics and paraxial beam optics. It also clarifies the role of lateral ray and beam shifts for reflection at a boundary with incidence-angle-dependent reflection coefficient, especially when multiply reflected fields are converted into modal form. Results are given for beams which are reflected at both boundaries, reflected at one boundary and refracted before reaching the other boundary, and trapped by refraction without reaching either boundary. In the first case, conversion to modal form is more convenient at large distances whereas in the latter case, paraxial beam tracking is preferable."
"A modal analysis of the problems of excitation of the dominant mode in an optical fiber by incident plane waves and Gaussian beams has been carried out, and the results applied to the effect on transmission of misalignment in fiber junctions due to offsets, tilts, and gaps. The results in cases of matched media confirm the accuracy of previous theoretical treatments using the Born approximation, which in turn show good agreement with experimental results. In addition, the modal analysis gives more precise solutions when there is a mismatch of media and makes possible the treatment of some problems to which the Born approximation is not applicable."
"Mode filter actions are found theoretically in an optical dielectric waveguide consisting of a core and a thin cladding layer which is further surrounded by an external higher index region. The propagating waves, which are usually considered to be cutoff modes, can be guided with a small amount of loss under a certain condition. These waves are defined here as quasi-guided modes. These modes tend to the guided modes of the guide when the cladding thickness increases infinitely. A method is given to estimate the losses. As an example, the radiation losses are formulated for a symmetric slab waveguide, and are found to be approximately proportional to the cube of the mode number of the quasi-guided mode. Therefore, losses of the quasi-guided modes depend strongly on the mode number. It is suggested that fibers with large core diameters can be used as quasi-single mode fibers by covering the clad-type multimode fibers with external higher index surroundings and choosing the parameters properly."
"A method is described for determining the refractive index profile of an optical waveguide. AII optimization algorithm has been employed to obtain the index profile from the measured reflection coefficient data. Several numerical experiments have been performed to prove the accuracy of the present method. Some of the results are included."
"An analytical method is described which determines the distributed capacitance of a thin-film electrooptic light modulator with parallel-strip electrodes. The capacitance is expressed in a variational form. The anisotropy of the crystal and the presence of surrounding air are considered. Numerical examples for the case of Li-Nb-O/sub 3/ are given."
"This letter describes experimental results of a simple optical fiber directional coupler which picks up a small portion of the transmitted power in a main optical fiber transmission line without affecting the characteristics of the main line. This directional coupler consists of two fibers closely parallel in a certain coupling length; an index matching liquid, Si-oil, fills the coupling region. A 50-dB power coupling and 21=dB directivity are measured. Insertion loss is almost negligible. The measured power coupling is much larger than that expected by the simple coupling theory."
"A directional coupler for optical fiber applications is constructed of two pieces of optical fibers cut obliquely and a thin dielectric film. Coupling coefficient -20 dB to -10 dB depending on the refractive index of the dielectric film, insertion loss 1 dB, and directivity -20 dB are measured. They agree with the analytical results."

"A theoretical treatment of scattering of electromagnetic surface waves from thin metallic obstacles of a semiannular shape on the dielectric-image line is presented. The method of treatment relies heavily on the expansion of the total fields of the line in terms of its complete set of discrete and continuous modes which in turn is fully derived."
"A theoretical treatment is presented of the scattering of a surface-wave mode on a planar surface waveguide at an abrupt axial transition. The latter is due to a dielectric obstacle that covers the line completely up to a given height. The analysis involves the matching of the tangential fields, expressed in terms of complete sets of eigenmodes, on the transition plane. The problem arises in certain obstacle detection schemes currently being proposed for guided transportation, which use the principle of guided RADAR."
"It is shown that the modes of a dielectric resonator are of two types: confined and nonconfined. Orthogonality properties and variational principles are derived for these modes, and their radiation pattern and quality factor are investigated. The material of the resonator is assumed lossless and of very high permittivity."
"The response of a dielectric resonator excited by either interior volume sources or incident exterior waves is investigated. Special attention is devoted to phenomena at resonace, and in particular to the induced electric and magnetic dipoles. Simple formulas are obtained for the scattering cross section. The material of the resonator is assumed lossless and of very high permittivity."
"The accuracy of the approximate solution to the wave equation in the \"large aperture\" case was investigated. The measured distribution of energy in the various transverse modes corresponded to the Laguerre-Gaussian solutions; resonant frequencies, however, deviated from those predicted by the approximate theory by as much as 2 percent for high radial mode numbers. Two first order perturbation calculations, including a neglected term in the wave equation and the nonsphericity of constant phase surfaces, yielded resonant frequencies in agreement with experiment."
"A very general variational procedure is used to compute single or coupled microstrips under the quasi-TEM approximation. The capacitance model is found by means of a unique fundamental cell. The method is essentially an extension of Smith's, but may be used to study a wider variety of problems, such as nonuniform strip arrays, coplanar striplines, and broad-side coupled strips. Moreover, it is also possible to compute the coupling capacitance between nonadjacent strips."
"Methods of field and network theory are jointly applied to the problem of deriving wide-band models for interacting inductive irises and steps in standard and oversize lossless rectangular guides. The resulting equivalent network is a cascade of lumped multiports, described by means of their reactance matrix, given in the canonical Foster's form, and of several parallel transmission lines, connecting the interacting discontinuities. The required frequency band and the accuracy of the model can be prescribed at will. The features of the approach are: the solution of the field problem yields a reactance matrix with monotonic convergence properties; small matrices only need be manipulated; the frequency dependence is explicit, so that the field analysis need not be repeated at each frequency point; a true network model (and not a \"spot frequency\" equivalent circuit) is produced, which is prerequisite for exact synthesis."
"An electromagnetic (EM) field perturbation technique is used to find internal electrical fields and the absorbed power of a prolate spheroid being irradiated by a plane wave when the waveIength is long compared to the dimensions of the spheroid. The results show significant differences in the power absorption patterns with changes in the orientation of the spheroid with respect to the incident EM fields. Calculations of the power absorbed by a prolate spheroid model of man are given."
"General design equations for an interdigitated directional coupler are derived. The design equations are written in terms of even- and odd-mode admittances for a pair of coupled lines which are identical to any pair of adjacent lines in the coupler. The calculated values of even- and odd-mode admittances can be translated into a physical configuration from published data on coupled lines."
"Using the nonlinear theory of Gardiner and Ghobrial gain compression in varactor frequency converters is characterized and related to the distortion performance of the device. It is shown that gain compression results from the generation of a current component at the sideband frequency which is in antiphase with the main sideband current component. It is also shown that under certain conditions, high levels of intermodulation distortion can exist with practically zero gain compression."
"The reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves by a slant interface between two dielectric media is investigated. By using suitable Green's functions and a geometrical optics approximation for the field on the dielectric interface, expressions for the transmitted and reflected fields are derived. The approximate results obtained in this manner are compared with the available numerical data and are shown to be fairly accurate for a number of cases of interest."
"The relations are established between the scalar modes in an infinite lenslike medium and the vector modes in a self-focusing optical fiber with a finite homogeneous cladding. It is shown that both the transverse fields and the longitudinal fields of the vector modes can be expressed in terms of the scalar modes, provided the fiber is operated in the core mode region. Otherwise, significant discrepancies could arise. The scalar modes, however, cannot describe the cladding modes which are caused by the index discontintuity at the outer surface of the cladding."
"Arguments are proposed according to which, in the Maxwell equations giving the axial field components, the expansion of the transverse field components in terms of unperturbed normal modes could be differentiated term by term. This would be allowed when the perturbed transverse field respects the possible nullity conditions imposed by the boundaries of the unperturbed waveguide and when it has no singularity."
"In the above paper, Fig. 5 on page 794 should be as shown here in Fig. 1. An error occurred in translating the tabulated data into graphic form. The corrected figure is consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3 of the above paper."
"In the above paper, two errors have been noted. First, the proof of positive-definiteness of the integral operator on page 239 requires that the potential vanish at infinity. This condition should have been stated just before (19b). By virtue of mirror image symmetries all the examples presented satisfy this condition."
"In the above paper, (23) is incorrectly referenced. The correct reference should be [4]. A second error appears on page 760 in the second sentence of the paragraph beginning immediately above Fig. 2. In this sentence the words \"dynamic\" and \"magnetostatic\" should be interchanged. The authors wish to thank J. Sethares of the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories for bringing the latter error to their attention."

"Beginning with the February 1975 issue, Dr. Don Parker is the Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques. Dr. Parker is well known to the MTT community through his technical contributions, his long-standing involvement with MTT Symposia, and as a member of AdCom. I heartily welcome him to his new post and wish him well, knowing that the TRANSACTIONS is in good hands."
"Although this is the second issue of the TRANSACTIONS for which I am responsible, I have been intimately involved in the Editorship for about eight months. I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the exchange of technical information and knowledge among the microwave community in this way."
"A novel thin-film down-converter which is pumped at a submultiple of the local-oscillator frequency has given a conversion loss which is comparable to the performance of conventional balanced mixers. The converter consists of two stripline filters and two Schottky-barrier diodes which are shunt mounted in a strip transmission line. The conversion loss measured at a signal frequency of 3.5 GHz is 3.2 dB for a pump frequency of 1.7 GHz and 4.9 dB for a pump frequency of 0.85 GHz. The circuit looks attractive for use at millimeter-wave frequencies where stable pump sources with low FM noise are not readily available."
"GaAs Schotty-barrier diodes with a zero-bias cutoff frequency of 800 GHz have been used in an integrated-circuit balanced diode mixer operating with a signal frequency centered at 9.3 GHz and a local-oscillator (LO) frequency at 7.8 GHz. For an instantaneous bandwidth of 1.0 GHz, the conversion loss (including all circuits and connector losses) was under 3.15 dB. Over the center 0.5 GHz of the band, the conversion loss was less than or equal to 2.8 dB. The conversion loss at the image-band edges was greater than 25 dB; the loss at the center of the image band was greater than 35 dB."
"A new double-tuned parametric amplifier signal-circuit configuration and a method for its experimental optimization is described. A new in-line signal circuit, which is adapted from a quarter-wave-coupled bandpass filter, is intended for use at higher microwave and millimeter-wave parametric amplifiers (paramps). It is shown that, using this signal circuit, a broader flat-gain response can be obtained as compared with the conventional double-tuned signal circuit with broad-banding stub placed multihalf-wavelength apart from the diode. To suppress the spurious response, a semilumped approximation is applied in the design. Finally, a \"cold and hot\" test method to optimize the double-tuned signal circuit is introduced."
"This paper derives the eigennetworks of radial-waveguide circulators using partial-height ferrite resonators with n=2 Chebyshev characteristics. To obtain a Chebyshev response with such junctions it is necessary to establish the proper phase angles and admittance levels of the three eigennetworks of the device. This paper derives the phase angles for the eigennetworks but relies on experiments to establish the admittance levels. The configurations dealt with include the standard circulators using either half-wave-long ferrite resonators open circuited (OC) at both ends or coupled quarter-wave-long ferrite resonators OC at one end and short circuited (SQ) at the other. It also includes the design of a new single quarter-wave-long version, which is likely to replace the two more conventional arrangements in common usage. It is observed that the eigennetworks of any one of the geometries is sufficient to characterize the other two."
"A method of computer analysis of planar (two-dimensional) circuits having an arbitrarily shaped short boundary is proposed. The proposed method is based upon the contour integral representation of the two-dimensional wave equation. Results of the computer analyses for simple circuits are compared with analytical solutions to show the validlty and accuracy of the proposed method. Some examples of analyses of practical circuits are also presented."
"The use of an interdigitated coupler and a pair of switching circuits composed of appropriate diodes and two-stub matching circuits is experimentally shown to produce a broad-band reflection-type 180/spl deg/ phase shift section operating at 8.50-10.50 GHz with /spl plusmn/ 2/spl deg/ error when fabricated using microwave integrated circuit techniques."
"Substantial improvements in the coupling efficiency from injection lasers to multimode glass fibers have been obtained by spherical lenses melted on the fiber ends. However, the spherical lens has its own drawbacks. It excites high-order modes which are slow and Iossy and it becomes less effective when used with graded index fibers such as Selfoc. This paper proposes a hyperbolic lens which, in principle, is free from these drawbacks. Several samples have been made by first grinding one end of each fiber in a wedge form and then mechanically or flame-polishing the ground surface. These preliminary samples improved the coupling efficiency by a factor of 2-5 over the simple flat-end coupling depending on the difference in the refractive indices of the core and cladding. The improvement is slightly better than that achieved by spherical lenses."
"A right circular cylindrical cavity designed to resonate at 380 MHz was developed to irradiate a monkey head with little or no radio frequency exposure to other tissues. The system is used in studies of the behavioral effects of the absorption of radiant power. Dose-rate measurements were made with an electrically equivalent calorimetric load, consisting of a saline-filled plastic cylinder whose geometry and position in the cavity reproduced cavity and transmission line parameters measured with a test animal. Since integral dose rate P/sub m/ (total power absorbed) is proportional to the net power transmitted to the cavity P/sub t/ the constant of proportionality K/sub m/= P/sub m/ / P/sub t/ must account for the absorption of field energy by the tissue. K/sub m/ was determined by comparing the temperature rise produced in a fixed time period by the dissipation of dc power to the temperature rise produced by RF radiation in the same time period. It was found that, at an ambient temperature of 25/spl plusmn/2/spl deg/C and a relative humidity of 55 /spl plusmn/ 5 percent, K/sub m/ was 0.62."
"The heads of two rhesus monkeys were irradiated in a 383-MHz resonant cavity immediately before and during performance of a four-choice forced-choice serial reaction task. CW radiation at integral dose rates of 0.001 -17.5 W were delivered to the head. No effects were observed below a critical dose level (/spl ap/23 W/kg) derived from integral dose rate and body mass. Above this level, behavioral suppression occurred, i.e., correct response rate was profoundly altered. The effect was completely reversible and repeatable in one of the subjects---the other subject did not recover completely and was sacrificed for histological examination which revealed no gross or microscopic damage. The nature of the effect suggests a neurochemical rather than an electrical or mechanical basis for the results."
"A swept-frequency-type reflectometer is newly developed which is capable of measuring the distances to the reflection locations and reflection magnitudes in the coaxial line or waveguide, using a double-swept-frequency (DSF) source and a bandpass filter. The principle of this reflectometer and experimental results obtained at 2 GHz are given."
"The propagation coefficient in a slotted waveguide partially loaded with a lossy dielectric can be determined accurately, in terms of the measured standing-wave pattern, by means of a computer program solving a set of transcendental equations. This determination is a necessary step in a permittivity measurement technique which was recently proposed by several authors."
"The electric-field quantities E, E/sub y/, E/sub z/, and the magnetic-field quantities H and H/sub x/ in a rectangular drift tube-loaded cavity resonating in the TE/sub 101/ mode have been measured along the z direction by means of the perturbation method using a dielectric bead, a metallic disk, a metallic needle, a metallic sphere, and a ferrite disk. The relative errors for E and E/sub y/ are 3 percent; for E/sub z/, 10 percent on the average; whereas for H and H/sub z/, they are 10 percent at least. The ferrite disk, being superior to the metallic sphere, offers a new technique in determining magnetic-field components in cavity resonators."
"Experirnents on a new edge-guided mode isolator are reported. In this isolator, one edge of a wide strip is shorted to the ground, and no lossy electrical materials are used. Large isolation and small insertion losses were obtained."
"Let us denote the familiar odd-mode fringing capacitance which is plotted in graphs given by Getsinger by C/sub f0/. It is further defined by Fig. 1(b) in the limit as the magnetic wall tends to infinity on the right. We also denote the corresponding fringing capacitance of the symmetrical coaxial structure of Fig. 1(a) by C/sub f0/. When the dimensions of Fig. 1(a) and (b) are such that s' = s, it is convenient to denote the difference between C/sub f0'/ and C/sub f0'/ by /spl utri/C/sub f0/, and define it as the interaction between the symmetrical odd-mode fringing capacitances. Clearly, /spl utri/C/sub f0/ has the property of approaching zero as w/ (b - t) /spl rarr/ 0 [w is defied in Fig. 1(a)]. Moreover, whenever /spl utri/C/sub f0/ is known, C/fub f0/ is also known."

"The idea for this Special Issue on Microwave Communications grew out of a desire to couple the device and circuit designers within the microwave community more closely to the systems that utilize the outputs of their technologies. Accordingly, this Special Issue has been assembled in order to describe systems either currently operating, or under development, whose concept was stimulated, and existence made possible, by devices and circuits developed by members of the MTT Society and the organizations they represent."
"In this paper, we describe the characteristics and several parts of a high-capacity digital communications system using the low-loss circular waveguide."
"This paper describes the design and performance of a repeater for a 20-GHz high-speed digital radio-relay system with a transmission capacity of 400 Mb/s. The repeater is totally solid state for miniaturization, high reliability and economy with the adoption of microwave IC's, monolithic lC's, and direct oscillation by Gunn diodes in the 20-GHz band. The modulation and demodulation techniques of the repeater employ QPSK, which has a theoretical advantage over FSK, DPSK, or ASK in error rate performance, considering spectrum utilization. The error rate performance is further improved by using a simple digital equalization for intersymbol interference. The error rate performance of this system was measured. From the test results, it became evident that the equivalent carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N) degradation of error rate performance at a 10/sup -6/ error rate was about 5 dB under fixed temperature conditions and that the equivalent C/N degradation due to a -10/spl deg/C to +45/spl deg/C temperature variation was only 1 dB. The experimental 13-hop system employing the repeaters has been operating stably since April 1973."
"Improvements in microwave repeaters are outlined utilizing new circuit concepts for the receiver, transmitter, and branching-filter systems. In this way, a 1.5-dB decrease in the receiver noise figure and a 1-dB reduction in the attenuation of branching filter systems are obtained with a simultaneous 2-dB overall increase of transmitter-multiplier and upconverter efficiencies, resulting in a higher signal-to-noise ratio. An improvement is achieved in the AM-to-PM conversion and group-delay characteristics, too. The new circuits have been developed for Hungarian all-solid-state communications systems operating in the 4-, 6-, and 8-GHz frequency bands."
"The design of a low-cost FM-microwave satellite-ground-station receiver is described. It is capable of accepting 12 contiguous color-television equivalent-bandwidth channels in the 11.72-12.2-GHz band using a wide-band FM format and frequency division multiplexing (FDM) of the channels. Each channel has 36 MHz of usable bandwidth with a 4-MHz guard band and provides a CATV compatible output. The overall system specifications are first discussed. Then consideration is given to the design, fabrication, and evaluation of the different subsystems in the receiver."
"The optimum modulation method for a high-sensitivity homodyne system employing a reflection-type modulator is investigated. General expressions are derived which describe the effect of the modulator performance on the phase-sensitive conversion loss and noise figure of the system. It is shown that the highest phase-detection and the highest amplitude-detection sensitivities can be simultaneously attainable by the binary modulation method. This theoretical result is confirmed by the performance of the practical system employing a varactor binary modulator. The system has the minimum conversion loss of 6.3 dB. The rejection ratio for the quadrature signal is 42 dB, and the noise figure is 8.7 dB at 9.45 GHz."
"A new linearizing method for microwave communication FM oscillators is presented. As a linearizing mechanism the frequency perturbation caused by tuned harmonic(s) is utilized. Analytical formulation of linearity requirements for the general case are given and explicit relations are delivered for the second harmonic-tuned FM oscillator. Linearity and noise loading results are shown, obtained with an experimental 250-mW X band Gunn diode FM oscillator and satisfying CCIR linearity and noise loading requirements for broad-band microwave radio links."
"This paper describes the design and performance of small-signal stable multistage Gunn-effect reflection-type amplifiers for communication systems in X, Ku, and Ka bands. A single-stage design approach is developed, based on measured small-signal Z parameters of the Gunn diodes. This technique is then applied to a microstrip medium at lower frequencies (X and Ku bands) and to a coax/waveguide hybrid structure at Ku band. Performance of a two-stage amplifier is described in the bands 11.7 to 12.2 GHz and 14.0 to 14.5 GHz. In high Ka band, performance of both a two- and a four-stage amplifier is presented."
"The analysis and design of a low-noise 500-MHz bandwidth MIC image- and sum-enhanced 12-GHz mixer-IF amplifier is described. Typical midband noise figures of 6.3 dB have been achieved."
"Microwave beams can be kept confined by sequences of pairs of cylindrical mirrors, each pair acting as a lens. At 100 GHz, with 1.2-m x 1.2-m focusers spaced 80 m apart, a loss of the order of 2 dB/km has been measured in clear weather. The use of this beam-guiding arrangement, called a \"Hertzian cable,\" for distribution of information in cities is discussed."
"Radio wave propagation in the 40-140-GHz band through the first hundred kilometers of the clear atmosphere is strongly influenced by many (> 30) lines of the oxygen microwave spectrum (O/sub 2/-MS) and to a lesser extent by water vapor. A unified treatment of molecular attenuation and phase dispersion is formulated whereby results of molecular physics are translated into frequency-, temperature-, and pressure-dependencies. The propagation factors are developed for O/sub 2/ continuum---(h <10 km) and line--- (h >20 km) spectra taking into account pressure-broadening (h <40 km), Zeeman-splitting (h >40 km), and Doppler broadening (h >60 km). The influence of water vapor is discussed briefly. The filter characteristics of dry air are evaluated for various path models. Examples of computer plots of attenuation and dispersion rates are given as a function of altitude h for homogeneous, zenith, and tangential path geometries through the 1962 U. S. standard atmosphere."
"This paper addresses the problem of defining, measuring, and evaluating linearity of memoryless, nonlinear devices with relatively narrow bandwidths. The analysis is based on the single-carrier transfer characteristic and leads to a definition of linearity in terms of a transform which is determined by the input-signal composition and the working conditions of the device."
"A method is proposed whereby a (microwave) phase bridge can be constricted to simultaneously measure both the phase and amplitude balance of a biphase phase-shift-keyed (PSK) modulator. Given an initial narrow-band phase shifter that is capable of either continuous uncalibrated phase shifting or slow switching between calibrated fixed-90/spl deg/ phase shifts, the phase and amplitude balance of a second wide-band phase shifter (biphase modulator) can be determined. Furthermore, these measurements may be dynamically and simultaneously displayed in real time on a dual-trace oscilloscope. A significant feature of the method is the unique identification of either or both the phase and amplitude unbalance by means of the symmetric or asymmetric features that these unbalances induce in the display Pattern. Quantitative criteria for the sensitivity of the technique are presented."

"The modes of propagation along a coaxial structure contained within a circular tunnel are considered. The primary objective is to develop an approximate impedance boundary condition at the outer surface of the shielded cable that can be used in previously developed formalisms for axial conductors in tunnels. It is assumed that the metal braid can be characterized by a surface-transfer impedance. We also account for the possibility that a Iossy film exists on the outer surface of the dielectric jacket of the cable."
"Symmetric structures such as circular and square waveguides may conveniently be used for dual polarization application. In this work the square waveguide with a dielectric lining of the same geometry is analyzed using a Galerkin-type method, with experimental verification. Modal characteristics, propagation constants, and bandwidth (BW) properties are outlined. Some interesting variations, depending on whether the value of the dielectric constant of the lining is higher or lower than that of the included material, are described and quantified to the extent possible by the accuracy of the method."
"We give two different sufficient conditions for the transfer function of two-mode random media to be minimum phase. The second of these results states that the signal transfer function will be minimum phase if the spurious mode is dissipated faster than it is coupled from the signal mode, in a certain sense. Two illustrative examples are given. These two conditions cannot be greatly improved."
"The problem of deriving sets of statistical coupled equations for the second and fourth moments of the mode amplitudes in a fiber with mode coupling is considered, starting from the deterministic coupled wave equations describing an electromagnetic field propagating in a lossless fiber. Our results extend the work of Marcuse, and, in particular, allow one to deduce sets of equations for quantities which describe the cross correlation between different modes. Furthermore, we obtain new results regarding the variances and cross correlations of the power in the modes (fourth-order amplitude statistics)"
"The application of symmetry analysis to uniform waveguides is discussed. Symmetry analysis provides exact information concerning mode classification, mode degeneracy, modal electromagnetic-field symmetries, and the minimum waveguide sectors which completely determine the modes in each mode class. Tables are presented which list the possible mode classes and their degeneracies for the two general symmetry families, C/sub n/ and C/sub nv/, of uniform waveguides. Tables showing the azimuthal dependence of the longitudinal components of the electric and magnetic fields for each mode class are given. Based on this azimuthal dependence, figures showing the minimum waveguide sectors which are necessary and sufficient to completely determine the modes of the various mode classes are presented. The application of symmetry analysis is illustrated by considering uniform waveguides with C/sub 4/ and C/sub 6v/ symmetry."
"The application of symmetry analysis to uniform waveguides is discussed. Symmetry analysis provides exact information concerning mode classification, mode degeneracy, modal electromagnetic- field symmetries, and the minimum waveguide sectors which completely determine the modes in each mode class. This paper provides a summary of the development. that leads to the results concerning symmetry-induced modal characteristics of uniform waveguides discussed in the previous paper. Some of the concepts of group theory are introduced, including the irreducible representations of symmetry groups. The use of the irreducible representations to determine the mode classes and their degeneracies is described. The projection operators belonging to the irreducible representations are introduced and their application to determining the azimuthal symmetry of the modal fields is explained. The minimum waveguide sectors for the mode classes are obtained from the azimuthal symmetry of the modal fields."
"The high computational expenditure of the least squares boundary residual method restricts its application to certain problems. It is therefore necessary to utilize the inherent simplicity of special cases together with convergence-optimization criteria in order to reduce computational time and storage requirements. The problem of the coaxial-to-circular waveguide junction is presented as an illustrative example of how this is performed. A selection criterion is also suggested to determine the optimum weighting factor."
"The least squares boundary residual technique as used for the numerical solution of scattering problems is extended to the solution of electromagnetic eigenvalue problems. The theory is described and numerical results are given for the solution of an L-shaped membrane and microstrip in a hollow conducting guide. The microstrip example was chosen as a test case to compare with Fourier matching. This least square error minimization technique is of the same family as point matching and Fourier matching; however, it is shown to have three potentially important advantages: 1) it is rigorously convergent, 2) the choice of optimum weighting factors greatly accelerates convergence between a decreasing upper bound and an increasing lower bound, and 3) it is free from problems of relative convergence."
"The resonance frequencies and the fields of a microstrip double-ring resonator are discussed. It is shown that no pure even or odd mode can be excited on the resonator. Therefore it is concluded that the rnicrostrip double-ring resonator principally cannot be used to measure the phase velocities of the even and the odd modes on a coupled microstrip line."
"A new circuit model is derived for parallel-coupled microstrip consisting of two separate pairs of coupled lines. Each pair consists of a homogenoeus TEM line coupled to a homogeneous TE line. One pair represents the hybrid even mode, the other represents the odd mode. Data calculated from the model are compared with experimental dispersion data for various parallel-coupled microstrip geometries. Agreement is excellent. The procedure for deriving the equivalent circuit is an example of a general technique for using coupled lines to model longitudinally uniform but transversely inhomogeneous lossless waveguide."
"Simple approximate formulas are derived for the phase shift through matched circulators---with and without transformer coupling---using expressions for the eigenadmittances Y/sub 0/, Y/sub -1/, and Y/sub 1/ which have recently been proposed. These formulas allow one to predict the phase shift from measurements of the VSWR in one case and from a knowledge of the transformer admittance Y in the second. They have been confirmed experimentally for strip-Iine circulators and indicate that in this respect circulators behave like electrically long transmission devices."
"The effect of the dielectric loading in a bidimensional analysis that follows. GaAs traveling-wave amplifier (TWA) is investigated, with respect to the EM power generated by the structure and the efficiency of the dc to RF conversion. The validity of some usual approximations and assumptions is studied and a parameter, i.e., the power gain X efficiency product, is proposed as a useful tool for comparing the possible performances of TWA's."
"Electromagnetic shock structure in nonlinear capacitance transmission lines can be resolved, and the energy losses associated with shock propagation explained, by including a resistance in series with the nonlinear capacitance. This resistance is inevitably present as the circuit representation of the nonvanishing relaxation time for the establishment of polarization in the nonlinear dielectric. Karbowiak and Freeman have dismissed this viewpoint as \"not tenable!\" This is a rebuttal of that statement."
"lt is pointed out that if the classical method of weak solution is to be used for the solution of the problem, then it is necessary to include a resistive element of a sufficient magnitude. This also is a feature of Landauer's work. The solution so obtained is accurate under well-defined conditions, and among others, it can be shown that energy losses associated with the shock front can be accounted for by that resistance. However, it is inconsequential to assume that as the value of the resistive element is reduced to zero, the energy balance continues to hold. This requires a separate proof. An exact analysis based on a series of experimental results and computer modeling shows that the classical discrepancy can be accounted for in a different way."
"In the above short paper, the method described for the characterization of IMPATT's and their circuits is based entirely upon an assumption that the whole oscillator can be correctly described by a single-resonant circuit. This the authors have been careful to emphasize. But it is by no means clear that such an assumption is tenable for any normal circuit configurations, nor that the test described to confirm the given equivalent circuit is sufficiently stringent. Though the resonant absorption may be fairly narrow, and its variation with diode bias smooth, this is no guarantee that the circuit is single tuned, that it does not, for example, require a further series reactance giving a broad resonance elsewhere, or that the components of the equivalent circuit are not themselves functions of frequency."

"This paper describes the microwave performance of GaAs FET's with two 1-mu m Schottky-barrier gates (dual-gate MESFET). At 10 GHz the MESFET, with an inductive second-gate termination, exhibits an 18-dB gain with --26-dB reverse isolation. Variation of the second-gate potential yields a 44-dB gain-modulation range. The minimum noise figure is 4.0 dB with 12-dB associated gain at 10 GHz. Pulse modulation of an RF carrier with a 65-ps fall ad a 100-ps rise time is demonstrated. The dual-gate MESFET with high gain and low noise figure is especially suited for receiver amplifiers with automatic gain control (AGC) as an option. The MESFET is equally attractive for subnanosecond pulsed-amplitude modulation (PAM), phase-shift-keyed (PSK), and frequency-shift-keyed (FSK) carrier modulation."
"This paper describes a solid-state millimeter-wave transmitter module consisting of an IMPATT oscillator, p-i-n quadri-phase modulator, and a three-stage IMPATT amplifier. The module has been operated up to 4-Gbits/s modulation rate with 500-mW output power in the 60-GHz range."
"An investigation of frequency multiplication using a step-recovery diode (SRD) driven into avalanche breakdown is presented. This mode of operation, which is called the \"breakdown mode,\" consists of a reverse-biased p-n junction, SRD, or IMPATT diode driven into reverse breakdown by an ac signal source. As the diode voltage passes from reverse bias to reverse breakdown and avalanche, the state of the diode switches quickfy from a depletion-layer capacitance to an avalanche inductance; hence the production of strong harmonics. A theoretical analysis and experimental investigation of a coaxial/waveguide 2-6-GHz frequency multiplier using HP5082-0320 step-recovery diodes, [R/sub s/ = 0.75 Omega, C/sub d/(-6/sub v/) = 1.0 pF] shows that the breakdown-mode frequency multiplier has a higher conversion efficiency than the conventional \"charge-storage\" multipuer. A measured conversion efficiency of 73 percent was achieved while the same circuit configuration produced 52 percent for the same diode used as a charge-storage multiplier under optimum forward-drive and tuning conditions. Also the theory developed in this paper indicates a maximum possible conversion efficiency of 80 percent for the breakdown-mode multiplier, which corresponds closely with the measured results, and a maximum theoretical efficiency for a forward driven diode of 64 percent. The performance of an FM microwave system was monitored using the breakdown multiplier as a LO in which a baseband SNR of 59 dB was recorded."
"Although graphical results and formulas are available for the design of microstrip couplers, the design procedure is hampered because even- and odd-mode impedances are always expressed in terms of the physical geometry. In practice the designer obtains these impedances and then requires to know the geometry given by them. A new design procedure for coupled parallel microstrip lines is therefore presented. The technique enables the geometry of the coupled lines to be obtained directly from the required even- and odd-mode impedances and uses single microstrip-line geometry as an intermediate step. The results are presented in graphical form using only two universal families of curves. Results are also presented in the form of simple formulas for design programs and also comparisons with practical results are made."
"The cataractogenic effects of near-zone 2450-MHz radiation in rabbits are presented. The power deposition pattern inside the eyes and head of rabbits has been determined using a thermocouple technique. It was found that a peak absorption of 0.92 W/kg occurred between the lens of the eye and the retina for each milliwatt/square centimeter incident. Time and power-density studies indicated a cataractogenic threshold of a 150-mW/cm2 incident, or 138-W/kg peak absorption behind the lens for 100 min. The threshold time decreased with increasing power density. Agreement between in vivo intraocular temperature measurements and finite-element computer predictions reinforces the suggestion of a thermal mechanism for microwave-induced lens opacities."
"Johnson's high-frequency representation theory for MOSFET's, experimentally confirmed by Hopkins up to 1 GHz, is extended in this short paper for SBFET's and is found to substantially agree with data for 1-mu m- and 1/2-mu m-gate GaAs SBFET's up to 12 GHz. Regenerative-feedback conductance not accounted for by conventional models is seen to be present in SBFET's at microwave frequencies."
"A varactor-tuned IMPATT-diode oscillator with a continuous and monotonic tuning bandwidth of 27 percent and a potential tuning range in excess of 40 percent is described. The results of a computer program which optimizes the tuning bandwidth of the equivalent circuit of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) are presented. The VCO consists of two varactors located symmetrically on each side of an IMPATT diode all mounted in a ridged waveguide with two matched outputs into 50-Omega coaxial. Experimental results on bandwidth, power output, frequency linearity, and FM noise are presented."

"A new and simple type of millimeter-wave isolator using a solid-state magnetoplasma in a reflection-beam system is described. Some data are presented showing performance at 94 GHz. Practical considerations indicate that performance should be much closer to ideal at higher frequencies."
"A formulation is proposed to calculate the frequencies of the eigenmodes for a resonator with a thin conductor disk placed in the median plane between two infinite parallel conductor plates. The numerical analysis is carried out for the E- and EH-modes, and these eigenvalues are calculated as the function of the ratio of the disk radius to the distance between the disk and one of the infinite conductor plates. It is shown that at a ratio greater than a certain value the exact eigenvalue is smaller than the one predicted by applying the conventional method for two-dimensional bifurcation of rectangular waveguide, but the latter becomes closer to the exact one with increasing ratio. The availability of our exact eigenvalues is demonstrated in determining experimentally the dielectric constant of Teflon plate specimen by applying those values. Then the constancy of the measured dielectric constant is confirmed irrespective of the modes and the ratios."
"The authors present an experimental and theoretical study of edge modes in a ferrite-loaded slot line. Nonreciprocal properties are obtained over a broad frequency band. Added microstrip lines provide suitable transitions. A theory based on magnetic boundary conditions shows good agreement with the experimental results and allows a comparison with stripline devices described by Hines. In particular, the characteristics of the slot-line isolators are satisfactorily explained by this theory."
"A complete study is presented on \"edge-guided-wave\" circulators (EGC). The fundamental physical principles which underlie EGC's operation are established and exploited to construct a broad-band circulator in the 8-12-GHz band. The performance data are compared to those of a \"continuous tracking\" circulator (CTC) and a traditional Y-junction circulator."
"This short paper describes the determination of couplings within a system of coupled cavities by measuring frequencies at which the phase of the input reflection coefficient is either 0/spl deg/ or 180/spl deg/.

"Measurements of the temperature coefficients of permittivity and of thermal expansion, for the important MIC substrate materials alumina and sapphire, are reported. The results are presented and in the case of sapphire include figures for the two main crystal orientations. An interesting correlation exists between our results for alumina substrates, and those for sapphire substrates in which the optical axis is perpendicular to the plane of the slice. The temperature stability of resonators on sapphire and alumina is discussed and experimental data are presented."

"In the above short paper,l an attempt was made to calculate the errors in VSWR and phase caused by detector mismatch in a backwards connected (power into the probe) slotted line. The short paper is wrong. There will be no first-order errors as predicted theoretically in the referenced short paper. The errors encountered in measuring nonlinear devices (diodes) are more complex than those encountered in measuring linear devices. It is very important that the harmonics generated by tbe diode being measured be absorbpd in a matched load and kept out of the detector (especially for high-VSWR diodes). A low-pass filter is commonly used in front of the detector, but (unless it is padded) this filter reflects the harmonic power back into the diode. When the diode being measured does not see a match at the harmonic frequencies, then the harmonic mismatch will interact with the diode to make more efficient or less efficient the conversion to harmonics, depending on the phase relationship between diode and harmonic mismatch. The variable conversion to harmonics will change the impedance of the diode being measured (at the fundamental frequency) as the phase between diode and harmonic mismatch (unpadded low-pass filter) is varied. Therefore, when using a backwards-connected slotted line, it is important to have in front of the detector a low-pass filter that is padded or otherwise matched at the harmonic frequencies as seen from the diode. It is not important for the detector to be matched at the fundamental frequency in a backwards-connected slotted line, as proven in the following discussion."

"A frequency-dependent hybrid-mode analysis of single and coupled slots and coplanar strips is presented. The dispersion characteristic and characteristic impedance of the structures are obtained by applying a Fourier transform technique and evaluating the resulting expressions numerically using the method of moments. Numerical results are presented and compared with results published by other investigators. The experimental performance of a slot-line coupler is compared with predicted performance based upon the results presented here for coupled slots. Excellent agreement has been obtained in all cases."
"The purpose of this paper is to derive the scattering matrix of junction circulators with Chebyshev characteristics. This is done by forming the overall eigenvalues of the circulator one at a time in terms of the ABCD matrix of the matching network and the initial set of the junction eigenvalues. This paper deals both with the case where the frequency variation of the in-phase eigennetwork at the gyrator terminals is neglected compared to that of the counterrotating ones, and with the case where it is included. It is found that the former approach is in excellent agreement with the results obtained by assuming a 1-port model for the circulator. The influence of this eigennetwork on the overall frequency response is studied separately by combining the electromagnetic and network problems in the case of the stripline circulator."
"The propagation characteristics of electromagnetic waves in a rectangular waveguide of a homogeneous medium embedded in a different medium have been found approximately. The total field is assumed to consist of four crossing plane waves interconnected at the boundaries by reflection matrices. The method is more accurate than other approximate techniques. New results are presented for tunnel propagation and attenuation of degenerate modes in metallic waveguides."
"Randomly imperfect waveguides are considered for use in long-distance transmission at millimeter and submillimeter wave-lengths. The steady-state attenuation constant, modal power distribution, and pulse spreading are calculated from Marcuse's coupled power equations. The result shows that a random waveguide can transmit 3.6 Gbit/s per square root of kilometer with a loss of 1.7 dB/km at 500 GHz. Mode conversions due to circular bends are considered next. It is shown that the systematic mode conversion due to bends is not of prime importance if the random coupling coefficient is much larger than the systematic one. This may be the most important feature of random metal waveguides for long-distance transmission applications."
"Primary characteristics of the light beam propagation through a complex-permittivity lens-like medium are investigated in more detail than in previous papers, with the help of approximate wave theory. Explicit general expressions for the spot size and the curvature of the phase front of a Gaussian beam as well as the real-valued ray transfer matrix are derived, and detailed numerical investigations are presented. The existence of a new type of propagation, in which the light beam propagates with constant amplitude of undulation, neither converging nor diverging, is pointed out. Furthermore, precise conditions are given for the occurence of convergent, divergent, and critical propagation, and the corresponding profiles of the real and imaginary parts of the complex permittivity in the transverse cross section are illustrated. The results of this paper will be useful for the evaluation of the effects of loss distributions inherent in practical optical fibers consisting of lens-like media, and also for the analysis or synthesis of laser resonators or amplifiers including a loss or gain distribution."
"A solution of the laser fields, both inside and outside the laser, is given in terms of the mode-conversion coefficients and an integral equation for the radiation pattern. It is shown how very accurate analytic solutions can be obtained by what, at first sight, appear to be extremely crude approximations. The reason is that mode conversion is taken implicitly into account by using a multiplier, whose exact form does not appear to be very critical, as a weighting function to average two different formulas for the function representing the radiation; and with the correct form for it, all the mode-conversion and reflection coefficients can be legitimately ignored. A plane-wave formula for this multiplier is a good first approximation, and a number of existing expressions occurring in the literature are obtained in this way. It is also shown rigorously that the results of an earlier obliquity-factor analysis apply. Further refinements are introduced to allow for higher order discrete modes, and good approximate analytic forms for the mode-reflection and conversion coefficients are obtained. A check with a rather extreme example shows excellent agreement with Ikegami's numerical computation for the dominant-mode reflection at the laser-air interface. The methods of this paper are applicable to general laser structures of cylindrical geometry with either continuous or discontinuous variations in refractive index. Very accurate numerical solutions should be obtainable after only one iteration of the integral equation, starting with the reflection-modified form of Hockham's formula as initiating function."

"The beam mode expansion method used to discuss the distraction problem by an aperture is applied to the analysis of the noise reduction structure consisting of two aperture stops. The incident field is a fundamental wave beam whose amplitude distribution is Gaussian. The transmitted field through the structure can be represented as a sum of beam mode functions and is regarded as a signal. The noise which is originated from the spontaneous emission is added to the incident Gaussian wave beam. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the output is discussed and optimum conditions are obtained numerically."

"It is attempted to provide a defintive statement of the theoretical bases and the computationally useful manifestations of integral equation formulations of field problems, and the expansion of fields in sequences of functions which are proper solutions of the wave equation. The reason for doing this is that it has become clear during the last ten years that sophisticated points of mathematical analysis have practical computational significance. For ease of exposition, only two-dimensional fields are treated in detail. The paper is in five parts. The first part (Sections I and II) is introductory. The second part (Sections III-V) deals with formal diffraction theory. Methods particularly suited to digital computation are presented in the third part (Sections VI-XI). The results of computational experience are assessed in the fourth part (Sections XII-XIV). The fifth part (Sections XV-XVII) discusses the types of investigation needed to increase the technological usefulness of existing techniques."
"A numerical method is described for the solution of the electromagnetic fields within an arbitrary dielectric scatterer of the order of one wavelength in diameter. The method treats the irradiation of the scatterer as an initial value problem. At t = 0, a plane-wave source of frequency f is assumed to be turned on. The diffraction of waves from this source is modeled by repeatedly solving a finite-difference analog of the time-dependent Maxwell's equations. Time stepping is continued until sinusoidual steady-state field values are observed at all points within the scatterer. The envelope of the standing wave is taken as the steady-state scattered field. As an example of this method, the computed results for a dielectric cylinder scatterer are presented. An error of less than /spl plusmn/10 percent in locating and evaluating the standing-wave peaks within the cylinder is achieved for a program execution time of 1 min. The extension of this method to the solution of the fields within three-dimensional dielectric scatterers is outlined."
"The theory and its implementation in a new user oriented computer program package is described for solving continuous or discrete worst case tolerance assignment problems simultaneously with the selection of the most favorable nominal design. Basically, the tolerance problem is to ensure that a design subject to specified tolerances will meet performance or other specifications. Our approach, which is believed to be new to the microwave design area, can solve a variety of tolerance and related problems. Dakin's tree search, a new quasi-Newton minimization method, and least pth approximation are used. The program itself is organized such that future additions and deletions of performance specifications and constraints, and replacement of cost functions and optimization methods are readily realized. Options and default values are used to enhance flexibility. The full Fortran listing of the program and documentation will be made available."
"A new algorithm is presented for the calculation of TEM parameters of microstrips, based on a lumped-circuit model of the microstrip transverse static field. The use of such an algorithm allows one to obtain either very high accuracies or very low computer times when ordinary accuracies are tolerated. Compared with the similar technique by Lennartsson, the analysis method presented here allows substantial reduction in computer time, storage, and errors."
"Inductive components of microstrip discontinuity equivalent circuits are calculated by the Galerkin method. The formulation and method of calculation are discussed and a large number of numerical results for symmetric corners, T junctions, and steps changes are presented. These results compare well with experiment."
"The experimental characterization of some microstrip structures of common interest, including symmetrical T junctions, is described. Some results are compared with data derived from recent three-dimensiotial static theory and from the uniform plane-wave model. It is concluded that while the three-dimensional theory requires further improvement, it is generally in much better agreement with the measured data than the two-dimensional uniform plane-wave model."
"The circuit construction and design of an X-band oscillator with a GaAs Schottky-gate FET have been studied. The oscillation characteristics including stability and noise performance have been examined in order to clarify the position of a GaAs FET as a microwave solid-state oscillator device. The experiments have revealed that 1) the GaAs FET simultaneously possesses the most desirable features of both Gunn and IMPATT oscillators, i.e., low bias voltage operation and fairly high efficiency, and 2) it is situated between Gunn and GaAs IMPATT oscillators with respect to noise properties. The results indicate that the GaAs FET oscillator will soon be joining the family of microwave solid-state oscillators as a promising new member."
"An analytical and experimental investigation of the properties of an antiparallel diode pair is presented. Such a configuration has the following unique and advantageous characteristics as a harmonic mixer: 1) reduced conversion loss by suppressing fundamental mixing products; 2) lower noise figure through suppression of local oscillator noise sidebands; 3) suppression of direct video detection; 4) inherent self protection against large peak inverse voltage burnout. These results are obtained without the use of either filters or balanced circuits employing hybrid junctions."
"The effect of temperature on the small-signal admittance of IMPATT diodes with uniformly doped and high-low doped (Read) structures is investigated experimentafly and theoretically. Small-signal admittance characteristics of X-band Si p+-n-n+, GaAs M-n-n+ (Schottky-uniform), and GaAs M-n+-n-n+ (Schottky-Read) IMPATT diodes are measured at various junction temperatures for different dc current levels. Small-signal analysis is performed on GaAs IMPATT diodes of uniformly doped and high-low doped structures, and the calculated results on temperature dependence of the device admittance are compared with the experimental results. Reasonable agreement is found between theory and experiment. It is shown that GaAs IMPATT diodes are superior to Si diodes in admittance temperature characteristics and that the uniformly doped structure has a small admittance temperature coefficient in magnitude, compared to the high-low doped structure. It is also shown by calculation that the admittance temperature coefficient of a punch-through diode is small in magnitude, compared to that of a non-punch-through diode."
"Explicit formulas are given for the design of optimum single-sided waveguide filters. Using a uniform waveguide with iris-coupled series stubs irregularly spaced along the waveguide, this class of filter results in a significant reduction in the number of resonators required to meet single-passband and single-stopband specifications over conventional techniques. Design information is given for both the Chebyshev and elliptic function cases from which the required structure may be obtained without recourse to synthesis procedures. Computer simulations of the response characteristics of both the quarter- and modified three-quarter-wave coupled quasi low-pass and the quasi high-pass designs are given. Experimental results on fifth-degree Chebyshev filters operating in X band for the former case are presented showing close agreement with theory."
"A new construction technique for broad-banding and temperature stabilization of a lumped-element circulator is presented to obtain a compact circulator for practical usage. By using a new integrated wide-banding network consisting of three series resonant circuits on the back of the junction substrate, 1.7-GHz double-tuned and triple-tuned broad-band circulators have been successfully developed. Fundamental junction parameters, such as an in-phase eigeninductance, parasitic capacitance, and nonreciprocal filling factor, have been investigated experimentally. A design theory for temperature compensation of a lumped-element circulator is also presented, and temperature compensation with bias magnetic field of postitive temperature coefficient has been applied to the 1.7-GHz broad-band circulators. As a result, 20-dB isolation bandwidths of more than 600 MHz (double-tuned type) and 950 MHz (triple-tuned type) have been obtained throughout the temperature range of -10 ~ +60/spl deg/C."
"Parameters are derived for circles of constant overall noise figure on the source admittance plane of a preamplifier cascaded with a noisy main amplifier. It is shown that the noise figure and noise measure of an amplifier can be expressed in terms of the scattering parameters of a lossless two-port network connected at the input of the amplifier. Examples are given which demonstrate how this network can be synthesized to meet amplifier noise specifications."
"A method for estimation of FM bias modulation sensitivity of a Gunn-diode oscillator is presented under the assumption of incomplete domain formation for a very short diode. Experimental measurements at 33 and 11.3 GHz are shown as compared with this estimate and the decrease of sensitivity with external Q, for modulation frequency high enough to eliminate thermal effects, is demonstrated."
"Studying systematically the variations of electrical characteristics of microstrip lines with the width w of the line, the thickness h, and the dielectric constant epsilon/sub r/ of the substrate, we have obtained a perfect linear variation with epsilon/sub r/. Then using a least squares method, we have been able to give an analytical expression of capacitances usable for 1 /spl les/ epsilon/sub r/ /spl les/ 100 and 0.04 /spl les/ w/h /spl les/ 10. The importance of this result is that we can give impedances and phase velocities without any computation."
"Measurement and calculation of the inductance of a nonstraight conductor close to ground return plane are considered. An equivalent circuit model solution is given, and the results are compared to measurements for a corner-type geometry. Much larger changes in inductance as a function of frequency have been observed for the corner-type geometry than for the equivalent straight-conductor geometry. The circuit model can be used to predict the inductance for other configurations."
"Selected prototype characteristics of nonequiripple antimetric elliptic-function filters which can be realized in orthogonal cascaded dual-mode circular or square waveguide structures are presented. Cavity-coupling data for 4-, 6-, and S-section 0.01- and 0.05-dB-ripple passband designs with variable stopband levels are tabulated. Quantitative comparisons of elliptic and Chebyshev filter designs are also discussed, indicating the superior characteristics of elliptic networks."

"Marcuse's coupled-power theory incorporates the effect of different modal group velocities as the only mechanism responsible for pulse broadening in multimode, imperfect, optical fibers. In this paper the earlier theory is generalized to include the bandwidth-dependent effects: material dispersion and the waveguide dispersion that occurs within each mode. It is predicted that the latter two effects may partially cancel one another, the degree of cancellation depending on the shape of the fiber's refractive-index profile. Whether this effect causes a significant reduction in the calculated pulsewidth is shown to depend on the amount of mode coupling."
"This paper presents a hybrid-mode solution for the characteristic impedance of microstrip on Iossless dielectric substrate. A solution to the hybrid-mode equations is obtained by applying the method of moments in the Fourier transform domain. Numerical results are presented showing the frequency dependence of both wavelength and characteristic impedance for single and coupled strips. These results are compared with those of other investigators in the low-frequency range."
"Uniform second-order asymptotic expansions are obtained for the propagation of TM waves in a perfectly conducting circular waveguide with sinusoidally perturbed walls using the method of multiple scales. The analysis concerns the interaction of two propagating modes satisfying the resonance condition imposed by the periodicity of the waveguide walls. Two cases of resonance are treated as well as the case of decoupled modes. In the first case resonance occurs whenever the difference between the wavenumbers of the two interacting modes is nearly equal to the wall wavenumber, while in the second case the difference is nearly equal to twice the wall wavenumber. The results of the theory are then applied to the design of a mode coupler."
"Terminal characteristic parameters for a uniform coupled-line four-port for the general case of an asymmetric, inhomogeneous system are derived in this paper. The parameters (impedance, admittance, etc.) are derived in terms of two independent modes that propagate in two uniformly coupled propagating systems. The four-port parameters derived are of the same form as those obtained for the symmetric case resulting in similar port equivalent circuits for various circuit configurations considered by Zysman and Johnson. The results obtained should be quite useful in designing asymmetric coupled-line circuits in an inhomogeneous medium for various known applications."
"A previously developed electromagnetic (EM) field perturbation analysis is used to calculate the electric fields in tissue prolate spheroids irradiated by plane waves with long wavelength compared to the spheroid dimensions. This theory is applied to prolate spheroid models of man and animals to obtain internal electric field strength, absorbed power distribution, and total absorbed power. These data are of value in estimating tissue EM power absorption in experimental animals and man. The theory may be used to help extrapolate animal biological effects data to man, and as a guide to establishing an EM radiation safety standard."
"A theoretical analysis of the tuning and modulation characteristics of transferred-electron oscillators is given. The effects of the device properties and temperature and the influence of the circuit are discussed. Experimental results are also reported."
"In this short paper a method of expanding the phase constant and the field of a multidielectric transmission line as a power series of the frequency is developed. The method provides a theoretical justification for the widely used \"static\" approximations and indicates the reason why their accuracy is frequently good. This expansion may also be useful for estimating an upper limit to the frequency band in which the dispersion does not exceed a specified value. A numerical example is included."
"By utilizing state variable theory, certain useful matrix identities involving submatrices of the chain parameter matrix for a multiconductor transmission line are shown. These identities are extensions of familiar properties associated with two-conductor lines to multiconductor lines and are used to formulate the complete solution for the terminal currents when the line is terminated by linear networks. The identities allow a simplified solution for these currents and reduce numerous redundant time-consuming matrix multiplications. In addition, the correspondence between familiar terms for the two-conductor case and the multiconductor case is shown."
"The reciprocity relation satisfied by the Green's function for the inhomogeneous partial differential equation in a multidielectric region with inhomogeneous, isotropic media is derived by using Green's theorem."
"The derivation of the dyadic Green's function for rectangular waveguides and cavities is approached systematically by using the theory of distributions. It is shown that, in order to obtain a complete solution for the field distribution in the entire structure, one must add an additional term to the classical expansion which is valid only outside the source region."
"Numerical results with respect to the piezoelectric coupling of a three-layer substrate (CdS-SiO/sub 2/-Si) are presented. <111> -cut Si is used, and the direction of propagation is [112/spl overbr/], the SiO/sub 2/ layer is amorphous and the CdS layer (hexagonal, 6 mm) has the c axis normal to the substrate. The choice of these materials is connected with the integration of acoustic surface-wave devices on silicon. The interesting result is that, depending on the applied transducer configuration for particular values of kh of the SiO/sub 2/ and CdS layer, an increase in the piezoelectric coupling, occurs. Its maximum exceeds the value of the coupling in the two-layer substrates: CdS-SiO/sub 2/ and CdS-Si, therefore more effective interdigital transducers can be designed for three-layer substrates."
"The propagation constant of waveguide partially loaded with a semiconductor in the H plane is evaluated using a three-mode approximation analysis. As the waveguide is progressively filled, a large peak occurs in the attenuation coefficient due to higher order mode propagation. In the presence of a transverse magnetic field, propagation becomes nonreciprocal and this nonreciprocal effect is shown to be significantly increased in the region of the peak.

"This letter presents a method for synthesizing quarter-wave Chebyshev transformers, low-pass and half-wave filters. The method uses sine-plane synthesis which greatly simplifies the numerical calculations and allows one to obtain good numerical accuracy using just a desk calculator. Equations for the transmission coefficient are given in a simplified form."
"A novel single hybrid tee frequency discriminator is investigated. It consists of ordinary microwave components and its tuning is achieved by means of a movable short circuit. The discriminator properties are comparable to those of an ordinary phase discriminator. Because of its simplicity, the discriminator can be used for instantaneous frequency measurements in nanosecond time intervals."
"In the above paper, to conform with the usual definitions of odd-and even-mode impedances, the impedance values read from Figs. 10, 14, 17, and 21 should be multiplied by two. The last sentence of paragraph one on page 664 should be changed to read: \"The total capacitance for each mode is simply two times that obtained for the quarter-section.\" Mode velocities and other quantities are correct as given."

"A description is given of two new mixers designed to operate in the 80-120-GHz range on the 36-ft radio telescope at Kitt Peak, Ariz. It is shown that for a hard-driven diode the parasitic resistance and capacitance are the primary factors influencing the design of the diode mount. A room-temperature mixer is described which achieves a single-sideband (SSB) conversion loss (L) of 5.5 dB, and a SSB noise temperature (T/sub m/) of 500 K (excluding the IF contribution) with a 1.4-GHz IF. A cryogenically cooled version, using a quartz structure to support the diode chip and contact whisker, achieves values of L = 5.8 dB and T/sub m/ = 300 K with a 4.75-GHz IF. The mixers use high-quality Schottky-barrier diodes in a one-quarter-height waveguide mount."
"Some new dielectric waveguide structures suitable for millimeter-wave and optical integrated circuits are presented. A method of analyzing wave propagation in these guides is developed by assuming simple field distribution and approximating the various regions of the guides in terms of effective dielectric constants. The mathematical formulation utilized results in simple eigenvalue equations from which the dispersion characteristics of the waveguides are readily obtained. Experimental results are described and the agreement between theory and experiment is shown to be quite good."
"The characteristics of new strip lines [i.e., a single strip-conductor coplanar-type strip line (S-CPS), a two symmetrical strip-conductor coplanar-type strip line (T-CPS), and a coupled strip-conductor coplanar-type strip line (C-CPS), which consists of single two-center strip conductors or coupled strip conductors and ground plates on a dielectric substrate and outer ground conductor] are calculated by the relaxation method. The effect of the outer ground conductor and side wall on these lines is analyzed and the characteristic impedance and phase-velocity ratio are determined. The characteristic impedance is determined experimentally and the maximum values of the discrepancies compared with the calculated value of each of the lines are 2.0-3.0 percent. Application examples of the coplanar-type strip line to microwave transistor amplifier and parallel-coupled filter are shown. A transistor amplifier of small size, light weight, wide bandwidth, and improved reliability is achieved. A parallel-coupled filter small in size (reduction ratio is more than 50 percent), with good frequency symmetry and featuring easy resonance frequency fine tuning is obtained."
"A new minimax network optimization algorithm not requiring derivatives has been developed. It is based on successive linear approximations to the nonlinear functions defining the problem. Adequate modeling of distributed parameter circuits for optimization purposes often involves parasitic, etc., which makes the gradient computation by the adjoint network method or related methods rather complicated, and often numerical errors are introduced in the gradients. Consequently, the algorithm is found to be of particular relevance in optimum design of practical microwave networks. The relative advantages of the proposed algorithm are established by comparison with known gradient and nongradient algorithms based on optimization of cascaded transmission-line transformers. The relevance to microwave filter design is demonstrated by an example which represents an improvement of analytical filter design results. Finally, optimum broad-band design of a practical coaxial transferred-electron reflection-type amplilier is carried out by means of the proposed method. The results are supported by experimental verification."
"Rabbit superior cervical ganglia were exposed to CW 2450-MHz fields within a temperature-controlled waveguide environment. Absorbed power densities between 2 and 1000 W/kg failed to significantly influence transmission Iatencies of responses recorded from postganglionic fibers due to stimulation of either B (myelinated) or C (umnyelinated) fibers in the preganglionic trunk."
"In an effort to make ferrites available for broad-band resonance isolator applications in high-power mirowave tubes, seven lithium ferrites and four nonlithium spinel ferrites were tested for resonance-loss behavior near an S band (2.0-4.0-GHz) linear helix. The observed behavior, i.e., the dependence of the absorption on the dimensions of the ferrites, can be attributed to excitation of surface magnetostatic modes. Using the results of the Damon-Eshbach theory for surface magnetostatic modes in semi-infinite slabs, resonance frequency and surface-wave attenuation factors were numerically calculated as a function of the propagation coefficient and the ratio of magnetization to internal field."

"A Ka-band millimeter-wave Gunn-amplifier structure with 15-GHz gain1/2-bandwidth product has been fabricated in reduced-height waveguide. Measurements were taken of the terminal admittance of the diode and its mount and used in the computer optimization of impedance matching transformer sections."
"The application of a new algorithm for minimax optimization is investigated. Unlike most of the previously published algorithms the new algorithm uses to its advantage certain obvious properties of the minimax function, namely, that the discontinuities in the first derivatives can be characterized by projections. An N-section transmission-line transformer is used as a test problem."
"Two general, modified Langrangian algorithms related to recent developments in nonlinear programming are presented. The methods give accurate results and are easy to program. An N-section transmission-line transformer is used as a test problem for minimax (equal ripple) optimization and the methods are compared to existing algorithms for network optimization."
"This short paper is a description of the technique used to monolithically interconnect TRAPATT diodes in an array--resulting in a diode having low inductance interconnection and integrated heat capacitance which is necessary for long pulsewidths. For given power dissipation density and pulse length, the transient temperature rise in the diode decreases with the diameter. The reduction in diode diameter, however, leads to reduced power output. To take advantage of the reduction in temperature rise of small-size diodes while maintaining a large power output, a multiple-diode structure, monolithically interconnected, was fabricated. Pulsewidth operation of 50 mu s has been achieved at a dissipation power density as high as 200 kW/cm/sup 2/, whereas the dissipation density must be reduced to 100 kW/cm/sup 2/ for the same total-area single-disk diode to operate reliably at 50 mu s."

"Light transmittance and microwave attenuation of a gold-film coating on a plastic substrate is investigated. The dependence of the transmittance of visible light upon the thickness or resistivity of a gold-film coating on a plastic substrate is analyzed numerically. The microwave attenuation produced in the far field over the frequency range of 100 MHz-30 GHz by the gold film is calculated and compared with experimental data. An optimum condition is established between the light transmittance and the microwave attenuation. The results are applicable to any transparent glass coated with any thin metallic film."

"A three-port circuit model is developed that describes the operation of interdigital transducers with arbitrary metallization ratios and electrode-polarity sequences at fundamental and higher harmonic frequencies. The electric fields that excite surface acoustic waves are found on an electrode-by-electrode basis using the approximation that the local electric fields are not influenced by electrodes more distant than the next-nearest neighbors. The resultant fields are expressed in terms of familiar functions, with a \"universal\" set of expansion coefficients given in Appendix II. Use of these fields in the circuit model developed earlier by other authors describes arbitrary transducers by modeling each electrode using the expansion coefficients appropriate to the local electrode environment. Illustrative results include the effective coupling coefficient of single-and double-electrode transducers of arbitrary metallization ratio for frequencies up to and including the eleventh harmonic. Also included is one example of the consequences of end effects in short transducers, and a detailed comparison of theory and experiment for transducers with a nonalternating polarity sequence [phase-reversal transducers (PRT's)]."
"The quasi-static TEM mode of a microstrip line may be obtained approximately from the solution of Laplace's equation subject to certain boundary conditions. The Green's function approach leads to the solution of a Fredholm integral equation with a logarithmic singularity in the kernel. It is shown that if the charge distribution on the strip is expanded in terms of Chebyshev polynomials then the integrals arising from the logarithmic term may be evaluated in closed from, and the integral equation may be approximated closely by a set of algebraic equations. The method is applied to numerous open and shielded configurations of strips and couple-strips in the presence of dielectrics. Numerical results are compared with exact results whenever possible and with results from previous authors. Design curves are presented for particular shielded couple-strip configurations."
"The problem of coupling between two collinear parallel-plate waveguides is investigated numerically using moment methods. The exciting mode in the waveguide is assumed as the incident field, and the integral equation for the induced current is expressed in terms of the reflected, transmitted, and evanescent currents on the waveguides. The integral equation is then solved numerically by a point-matching method and the reflection and the transmission coefficients and the radiated fields are obtained. To examine the accuracy of the results, the special case of a semi-infinite exciting waveguide coupled to a finite coupled waveguide is also considered and is solved numerically by treating the singularities of the induced currents using a transformation method. For a TE/sub 0,1/ excitation of the exciting waveguide, the results of both numerical methods are compared with the analytical results obtained previously using the Wiener-Hopf technique, and are found to be in good agreement. The methods are then used to study the effect of the coupled waveguide on the radiation field."
"A new variational derivation of the coupling coefficient is given for the problem of nondegenerate surface-wave modes on parallel dielectric waveguides. The results coincide with those of a number of different methods in the literature on the degenerate case, but all give distinct results in the nondegenerate case. These differences are examined and compared with the exact solution, whereby the approximations involved can be evaluated for the case of two parallel slab waveguides."
"The limitations of a widely used method for analyzing pulse distortion in a single-mode waveguiding structure are derived. The results are applied to propagation in optical waveguides, and for cases where material dispersion is dominated by a broad resonance line, pulse attenuation is found to be much more serious than the broadening of the pulse. In extremely low-loss regions, however, other effects may cause the reverse to be true."
"The electromagnetic fields within a detailed model of the human eye and its surrounding bony orbit are calculated for two different frequencies of plane-wave irradiation: 750 MHz and 1.5 GHz. The computation is performed with a finite-difference algorithm for the time-dependent Maxwell's equations, carried out to the sinusoidal steady state. The heating potential, derived from the square of the electric field, is used to calculate the temperatures induced within the eyeball of the model. This computation is performed with the implicit alternating-direction (IAD) algorithm for the heat conduction equation. Using an order-of-magnitude estimate of the heat-sinking capacity of the retinal blood supply, it is determined that a hot spot exceeding 40.4/spl deg/C occurs at the center of the model eyeball at an incident power level of 100 mW/cm/sup 2/ at 1.5 GHz."
"A simple analysis of the eigenvectors, representing the fundamental uncoupled wave modes of a pair of nonsymmetrical coupled lines in nonhomogeneous medium, proves that these two modes reduce, under a given condition, to an even mode with equal voltage magnitudes and an odd mode with equal current magnitudes and opposite polarities. The condition, which may be cast in many representative forms, is called \"congruence condition\" and may be formulated simply, for a nonhomogeneous dielectric medium, by saying that the ratio of the per-unit-length conductor-to-ground capacitances must be the same in the empty and in the filled structure. The essential interest of congruence lies in the drastic simplification it introduces in the expressions of the eigenvalues and of the mode velocities and in the expressions of the mode admittances and impedances for the two coupled lines. Because of this simplification, a straight forward matrix derivation may be written to obtain closed-form expressions of the entries of the 4 x 4 Y-, Z-, and S-parameter matrices of the coupled-line 4-port. The simplicity of the definition of the fundamental modes in congruent structures introduces great conceptual clarity in the description of coupled-wave propagation. Experimental evidence is presented which proves the physical existence of the even-mode wave and of the redefined odd-mode wave in suspended-substrate broadside-coupled striplines. Practical structures of this type are very closely congruent."

"Impedance matrix formulation is applied to the 4-port stripline circulator to determine the optimum performance. The space harmonics generated in the ferrite disk are determined. The distribution of the electric field and the power densities across the ferrite disk are clearly presented. Using an inner dielectric provides more flexibility in the design,"
"The insertion loss between ports 1 and 3 of a 3-port circulator with port 2 terminated in a short circuit varies about twice the single path loss. The purpose is to give approximate simple upper and lower bounds for this loss in terms of the single path insertion loss of the junction. One application of this arrangement is encountered in the connection of a filter and equalizer by a single circulator. The final result indicates that, in the absence of circuit losses, the double path loss varies between one and three times the single path loss."
"The integral of the square of the Airy function from one of its zeros to infinity is equal to the square of the first derivative of the Airy function at the zero considered. Two important applications of this result to fiber optics are discussed."
"The teratogenic effects of irradiation by low-level microwaves have been studied using the pupae of the darkling beetle Tenebrio rnolitor. For exposures of 2-h duration, statistically significant increases in teratogenesis were observed at waveguide power levels down to 200 muW; the pupation time increased monotonically with the power. Exposures of various durations and powers at a constant dosage of 4 mW/h strongly suggested that it is the total dosage which determines the level of teratological damage."
"The functional forms of the fields in a single-ridge waveguide are presented. Bethe's small-hole diffraction theory is used to determine the coefficient for coupling from various parts of the guide to a Fabry-Perot (FP) resonator. It is shown that frequency-independent coupling over a very broad band is possible, and specific examples are given for the band from 18.0 to 40.0 GHz."
"In the above paper, Lewin gave an expression for the bending loss of a dielectric fiber with circular cross section. I have shown that the bending loss of arbitrary optical guides can be obtained in a simple manner when the field of the straight guide is known. The purpose of this letter is to show that the results of the two theories are in agreement, except for a factor of 2."

Going beyond the point of fast, automatic measurements, they now give promise of high accuracy and are revolutionizing the microwave measurement field."
"Varactor-tuned millimeter-wave IMPATT diode oscillators in microstrip form using chip-mounted diodes are described. A nearly level output power of 28 /spl plusmn/ 8 mW was achieved over a 6-GHz tuning range. Tunable bandwidths as high as 8 GHz with 6-26 mW of power were obtained from a single source. P-type epitaxial silicon IMPATT diodes were used for both the active device and the tuning varactor functions."
"The design and performance of both the lumped-element TRAPATT oscillator circuit and deep-diffused p+-n-n+ silicon TRAPATT diodes designed primarily for pulsed RADAR applications in the UHF and L band frequency ranges are discussed. Circuit conditions for optimum performance are described. Methods of optimizing diodes are presented. Diode performance capability is shown to depend on the relative position of the junction in the device depletion region. Peak powers close to 900 W and maximum conversion efficiencies of 40 percent have been achieved from diodes with large p-region width to total depletion region width ratios. RF leading-edge jitter of less than 1 ns has been obtained under optimum circuit and diode operating conditions."

"An arbitrary six-port junction is analyzed as a microwave vector voltmeter, measuring the amplitudes and phase differences of two input signals in terms of power readings taken at the remaining four ports. The junction may be calibrated for measuring the complex ratio of these two signals using a self-calibration procedure which requires no attenuation or phase standards."
"Although the application of automated methods to power calibration problems in the UHF and microwave region has been described by a number of authors, the primary orientation has been towards the calibration of bolometer mounts and similar items. Little has been published on the problem of calibrating directional-coupler-bolometer-mount assemblies, which also play a major role in the calibration and measurement of UHF and microwave power. This paper develops a theoretical basis for several different approaches to this measurement problem."
"A wide range of microwave resonators are analyzed using the same three-dimensional transmission-line-matrix (TLM) computer program. The paper demonstrates the ease of application, versatility, and accuracy of the TLM method. The results presented include the dispersion characteristics of microstrip on dielectric and magnetic substrates and an example of a microstrip discontinuity. The surface-mode phenomenon of microstrip is also investigated."
"A model is developed for excitation of magnetostatic surface waves (MSSW) with microstrip transmission lines. Energy carried away in MSSW propagating perpendicular to the microstrip is related to electromagnetic (EM) energy propagating along the microstrip line by an equivalent radiation resistance. Supporting experimental results are in excellent agreement with predictions derived from this model."
"Exact, general, open-wire-line equivalent circuits for tapped-line combline and interdigital arrays are derived using a combination of graph transformations and induction. A significant feature of the equivalent circuits is that they do not require commensurate length sections. The equivalent circuit for tapped-line interdigital arrays is utilzed to develop design equations for tapped-line interdigital filters."
"Since the achievable gain of transistors typically falls off with increasing frequency, it is necessary to design interstage networks of microwave amplifiers with a complementary characteristic. A method is developed for the direct synthesis of interstage networks of prescribed gain versus frequency slopes. The bandwidth and ripple of these networks can also be precisely specified, and parasitic elements can be incorporated into synthesized networks. Design examples are presented, a complete computer program for the synthesis of interstage matching networks is described, and an octave band microwave amplifier illustrates an application of the interstage design techniques."
"Strongest power deposition for biological bodies is found for fields polarized along the longest dimension for frequencies such that the major length is about 0.4 times the free-space wavelength of radiation. Peak absorption in the presence of ground effects is observed at frequencies about one-half as much as for bodies isolated in free space. At resonance, an effective absorption area 34 times the shadow cross section is measured. Using biological-phantom figurines of the human body, distribution of power absorption is determined. Maximum power deposition is observed for the neck region. Initial experiments with anesthetized and dead rats have confirmed this observation."
"A microwave-to-dc energv conversion element consisting of a dipole antenna, a low-pass filter, a Schottky-barrier diode, and a dc filter has been modeled using a distributed transmission-line modeling technique that includes skin-effect losses. Computer simulation has shown 80-percent conversion efficiency and has indicated that the diode generates significant power at higher harmonics due to a resonance effect."
"This paper describes an investigation of the amplitude modulation (AM) noise sidebands of silicon IMPATT microwave oscillators and the effect these noise sidebands have on the excess noise temperature of parametric amplifiers. It is shown that the noise temperature may be affected under both large- and small-signal conditions to an extent which depends on the level of pump sideband noise. Simple relationships between easily measurable amplifier properties and pump noise power are given which enable the performance of any combination of pump and amplifier under the two signal conditions to be predicted. A method which simultaneously eliminates the small-signal effect and reduces the large-signal effect to an acceptable level is proposed and demonstrated to be a practical solution."
"A simplified TRAPATT oscillator model that allows the investigation of arbitrary terminal waveforms was utilized to investigate realistic TRAPATT waveforms and the tuning conditions necessary for high-efficiency operation. The effects of the higher harmonics on oscillator frequency and efficiency were studied. Cicuit impedance measurements of S-band TRAPATT oscillators support the theoretical predictions."

"This paper discusses the depolarizing effects of precipitation at millimeter wavelengths and describes an experiment in which depolarization on the ATS-6 satellite 20-GKz downlink is measured. Data are presented for unexplained clear weather variations in the observed polarization and for depolarization by rain and snow. A preliminary analysis indicates that for a given attenuation level, a satellite path exhibits more severe depolarization than experiments with ground systems would predict."
"This paper reviews current aircraft and satellite programs which use microwaves to measure ocean wave and surface wind conditions.

"Theoretical calculations and electric-field measurements were made to investigate the focusing effects of plane-wave-irradiated dielectric spheres (lenses). Spheres of different diameters and dielectric properties and plane wave sources of different frequencies were used in the calculations.

Also, the feasibility of a decade-bandwidth microstrip magic tee by cascading two -- 8.34-dB couplers is demonstrated by comparing the actual and theoretical results of a coupler."
"A resonant technique for evaluating the equivalent circuit of reciprocal microstrip discontinuities is described. The complex Z parameters of a discontinuity are related to the change in resonant frequencies and Q factors of a microstrip ring it perturbs. As an example, measurements made on inductive posts are presented and compared with theoretical values."
"A scheme is presented for accurately measuring range to a radar target by the use of microwave delay line tech miques and the use of solid-state subnanosecond digitaf threshold circuitry. The scheme obviates the need for expensive high-speed counters or analog thresholding and is cost effective to implement. A breadboard design of the technique was constructed and schematic diagrams are presented in this short paper. The results of the breadboard tests indicate that the range to a target can be measured and indicated up to 250 ft in 2-ft increments at a cost below $100.00."
"Transferred-electron oscillators capable of single-frequency operation at any of as many as 20 closely spaced frequencies have been constructed for microwave-frequency-memory applications around 11 GHz. Switching between different frequency states has been achieved with a single RF pulse as short as 0.1 mu s."
"A method has been developed for the precise nondestructive measurement of the dielectric constant and losses of slab-like samples such as microstrip substrates, for instance. Basically, the test setup consists of an open-ended rectangular waveguide, the flange of which is placed in contact with one side of the dielectric material, the other one being backed by a metal plate. The waveguide can be either simply cut at its end, or terminated by an inductive or capacitive iris. The reflection characteristics or the resonance parameters are related to the real and imaginary parts of the permittivity by means of computer-generated charts or an optimization program."
"The design and production of 502 X-band P-I-N diode phase-shifter elements for a transmissive phased-array RADAR are presented. These elements consist of three phase-shifter states and two integrated dipole radiators formed using microwave integrated circuit techniques.

"The electrical erosion resistance of composite silver-tungsten materials seems to improve with finer dispersions of the silver and tungsten; however, these materials with the finer dispersions exhibit a higher tendency to fail by catastrophic crack propagation during arc erosion testing. A fracture mechanics approach is taken to determine Gfc, the critical strain .energy release rate for crack extension under plane strain conditions for several compositions and particle size distributions of silver-tungsten materials. A qualitative analysis of resistance to crack propagation in the same materials under severe arcing agrees with the Glc measurements. The fracture toughness of these materials has also been compared to the microstructure by quantitative metallography. A relationship of Glcand the mean free path between tungsten particles has been found to agree on only a porton of the materials. A more complex term involving contiguity, volume fraction silver and mean free path has a good correlation with Glc for all the materials."
"A study was made of solder plated butt contacts to determine the feasibility of designing separable connectors for high reliability low energy circuits without gold or other precious metals. The chemical reactivity of tin-lead and the penetrability of films that formed on it were determined. It is little degraded by sulfur vapor, 02, SO2, H2S, CO, and NH3. However, films from NO2 and Cl2can grow to large thickness, limited only by time and concentration of the reactant. Corrosion of tin-lead was promoted by a synthetic dust and by salt spray. The penetrability of tin-lead depends on contact pressure, and, owing to creep, on temperature and time. Except at light loads with certain geometries, 0.025 mm (0.001 inch) tin-lead is penetrated nearly to the copper substrate. Reconnection to such spots may be less reliable than to fresh areas, particularly if the contacts are aged between separation and remating. The ability of films on tin-lead to be broken is dependent on contact geometry, load, and wipe. The most effective geometries are cones and short (2.5 ram) wedges having an acute included angle (60°), followed by cones and wedges with an obtuse angle (120°), followed by hemispheres of increasing radius (0.38 to 1.5 mm). The cones and wedges had rounded tips of 0.05 mm radius. The order of merit may be different with thickly plated contacts (much in excess of 0.025 mm); but thick coatings are undesirable on contacts because of their deformability. When good contact is obtained, however, as in the mating of clean surfaces, the ranking of probe geometries in maintaining good contact in aggressive atmospheres is different, with the 1.5 mm radius hemisphere being best. It may be possible to design reliable butt connectors with tin-lead coated contacts for critical applications. However, additional studies need to be undertaken. These include: development of field experience in varied environments, study of long term behavior of mated contacts such as cold welding at elevated temperature, and rematability of contacts that have been aged in corrosive environments between initial use and subsequent matings."
"Measurements on the formation and rupture of the molten metal bridge have been made for a number of contact materials, for currents of 8A to 11KA and for contact opening accelerations of 0.4X 103ms-2 to 16.0X 103ms-2. The bridge has three regimes: The initial melting period, a stable period, and an unstable period during which it eventually ruptures. The bridge behavior during these three periods is explained in terms of the interaction between power input into the bridge, hydrodynamic and surface tension elfects, and magnetic pinclh effects. The shortest bridges occur at both the highest current [11KA) and at the lowest current (8A). The longest bridges occur for currents in the range 500A to 1000A. The bridges that show the longest unstable regime occur for opening acceh;rations between 0.5 X 103 ms-2 and 2.0X 103ms-2"
"The anode arc is a source of erosion in electrical contacts. The erosion is thought to be proportional to the arc duration. This paper investigates the anodic arc length. A new experimental technique is described to measure arc duration. This method provided better statistics and better time resolution. By applying this technique to different metals, the experimental fact that these arcs are a succession of bursts of fixed duration became evident, The distribution of the number of arcs versus their length can be discussed in terms of the average number of bursts per unit time. Only two parameters for a given metal are sufficient to calculate the average arc length in any given circumstance. A classification o': different metals versus their tendency to sustain long anode arcs is presented."
"The flow behavior of a viscous substance between two parallel circular contacts, assuming that one of the contacts moves slowly relative to the other, has been analyzed. It has been shown that if the force of separation is less than a certain minimum calculated value, the contacts will stick. The shape of the moving liquid column between the contact surfaces depends upon surface-tension and viscosity. The equilibrium bridge shape, which is defined as the shape of the liquid meniscus between the contacts after the moving contact has stopped, depends on surface-tension and the pressure difference between the fluid and external pressure. This analysis may be useful in the analysis of the flow characteristics of molten metal bridges in electrical contacts and in explaining the behavior of mercury wetted contacts."
"Measurements have been made of the microyield and transient creep behavior of three commonly used precious alloy spring contact materials. These tests were done to determine how resistant the alloys were to contact force loss while stored for long times in a stressed condition. The alloys studied were Neyoro G, Paliney 7, and Neyoro 28A. Test temperatures from -58°F(223K) to 212°F(373K) and stresses up to the proportional limit were studied. Neyoro G and Paliney 7 in the age hardened condition were both found to be very resistant to microplastic deformation. Even for stresses equaling the proportional limit, contact force relaxation over several years is predicted to be only a few percent. Neyoro 28A is much less resistant to deformation."
"When a contact interrupts the circuit to a relay winding or another inductive load, severe cathode erosion can occur due to transient arcs associated with high voltage breakdown. Since the volume of this erosion is a function of the net charge conducted through the transient arcs and since the approximate erosion rate per coulomb is known for most contact materials, the contact erosion life can be estimated from a knowledge of the net charge transfer per operation. This paper presents a circuit technique to readily measure the net charge passage per operation without analytical treatment. The circuit uses current probes to monitor the arc current transient, integrates all positive and negative arc current surges separately, and subtracts the two results to yield an output proportional to the net charge flow through all the arcs resulting from the single inductive break. The detection circuitry has a response time of 2.5 ns; however, the holding time. characteristics are such that the output can be readily mete-ed using a digital voltmeter. A plot of measured Palladium cathode erosion under different load conditions versus that predicted using the net charge measuring circuit is presented to illustrate that the correlation is good."
"This paper reviews the technical development of a high reliability base metal connector and illustrates an effort to convert contact research into physical product using design judgment and expedient testing. Topics include normal force, corrosion susceptibility, contact lubrication, crimp termination, and performance testing."
"The results of this study demonstrate that addition of either carbon or nitrogen to tantalum is desirable not only for meeting the 50 volt dc leakage current criterion used on 230 V tantalum film capacitors, but also for optimizing capacitor reliability. Since both dopants lower the capacitance density by about 1% and 0.35% for each atomic (at',, % of N or C, respectively, the amounts added to tantalum should be kept as low as possible. Two at % of nitrogen or three at % carbon are sufficient to realize their beneficial, effect on capacitor leakage current and capacitor reliability, while addition of oxygen (up to 20 at %) does not improve capacitor quality. Possible effects of nitrogen and carbon doping on the electronic structure (band structure) of the anodic oxide will be discussed."
"Shock and vibration have been known to induce contact motion in electrical connectors and thereby cause failures or intermittent disturbances. This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the possibility of obtaining intermittent opens or high resistance caused by mechanically induced contact motion. Intermittent disturbances having time durations of less than one nanosecond are considered. Five possible mechanisms of creating intermit:ent opens are considered. They are: 1. Contact bounce 2. Contact sliding over surface irregularities 3. Contact sliding onto an insulating particle 4. Particle migration through contact area 5. Particle initially in the contact zone. Each possible mechanism is developed fully anc the important parameters are explored. Two actual connectors are evaluated for the possibility of obtaining intermittent opens for each of the five cases. The results of the evaluation are presented in this paper."
  "A central theme of the Holm Seminar in 1973 was the effect of environment on electric contacts. In addition to several technical papers, a panel discussion was conducted on this topic. This paper is a transcript of the discussion."
"Tables I-VI from the above-named article [ibid., vol. PHP-11, pp. 67-72, Mar. 1975], which were reduced to a size that makes for difficult reading, are reprinted here in a more readable form."
"The removal of a Cr203contaminant oxide film from gold surfaces by a ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN} etch and two different potassium iodide plus iodine (KI + I2) etchants was investigated using Auger electron spectroscopy and thermocompression (TC) bonding. It was shown that CAN effectively attacked and removed the Cr203while the KI + I2attacked the underlying gold film. The KI + I2improved the TC bondability both by undercutting some of the Cr203and by roughening the gold, thereby allowing more deformation to occur,during bonding. The implications of these results on selection of a chemical cleaning agent are discussed. The ability of CAN to dissolve a chromium adhesion layer under the gold metallization has also been investigated. It was shown that a heat treatment of 300°C for two hours in air prevented this undercutting; possible reasons are discussed."
 "A 20-chip integrated circuit memory has been constructed utilizing techniques of plastic embedment, photoformation of plastics, and selective electroless metal deposition previously reported [1]. This paper is a continuation and update of that earlier work. It has been demonstrated that groups of passivated integrated circuit chips can beaccurately placed in array positions, embedded in plastic, and interconnected with electroless nickel conductors deposited in photoformed multilayered conductor paths separated by selectively photoformed plastic dielectric layers. Thermal paths of nickel, plated directly to the backs of the chips and to an adhered photoetched metal substrate, effectively remove heat from the chips. The memory is assembled with relatively simple and inexpensive equipment, It is essentially nonrepairable and, because of limitations of photosensitive dielectrics available at the time of construction, is limited to operation in a computer-room environment. The three laboratory prototypes, constructed to demonstrate this packaging technique, were operated under dynamic cyclic-mode test conditions. No operational test data are available on the devices constructed nor can recommendations regarding use of the assembly method be made at this time."
"The thermal response of multilayer circuit boards is calculated for hot air heating, wave soldering and polyethylene glycol immersion heating. The analysis involves the modification of the simple exponential law of transient heating or cooling to include bodies transferring heat by n different modes on a corresponding number of distinct surface sections. A Blot number is associated with each surface section. The model allows for different heat transfer coefficients and ambient temperatures on each surface section. The analysis reveals an expression for the fi'nal equilibrium temperature of the body, and a thin plate geometry subject to a variety of heating and/or cooling processes is studied in detail, This configuration is also studied using a finite element transient conduction analysis. Conditions. under which the model is valid are determined by comparing the results of the two analyses. The processes considered correspond to various methods of soldering multilayer circuit boards Of various thickness and thermal conductivity. ConsiStency with actual soldering times is found for the cases for which data are available. It is shown that the model is appropriate for a rather wide range of physical condition,,; associated with the soldering of multilayer circuit boards, and the thermal characteristics of the various soldering processes are discussed."
"The use of Fr-14 (CF4) and Fr-116 (C2F6) to increase the margin arc-over voltage in dry Mylar energy storage capacitors is investigated. It is found that pressurization of capacitors with Fr-14 results in a small increase in arc-over voltage. However, pressurization with Fr-116 results in arcover voltages 1.5 to 2.5 times larger than obtained in air."
"Zirconium nitridefilms were prepared by reactive RF sputtering in argon-nitrogen mixtures, and various electrical properties of these films were investigated. The resistivities of zirconium nitride films varied from 5 X 102to 2 X 104µohm-cm, depending on sputtering pressure. In the resistivity range from 5 X 102to 1.3 X 103µ;ohm-cm, the films , display a reasonably small temperature coefficient of resistance (zero to -200 ppm/°C). After thermal aging, the zirconium nitride film resistors exhibit high stability."
"This paper presents a description of the present state of knowledge of the contact activation processes. The mechanisms for arc duration enhancement and contact erosion which are a direct result of relay contact activation are also discussed."
"Experiments are described which indicate the effect upon pulse breakdown voltage of high current arcing between copper electrodes in vacuum. Our results indicate a moderate degradation of breakdown voltage occurs when the electrode surfaces have been arced at currents exceeding 5000 A peak. This change is probably associated with the melting and erosion of the contacts by the arc. The degradation at the arc anode and the arc cathode appear to be about equal for all currents up to 45 kA peak."
"A new examination method is described by which the contact surface microstructure and composition may be related to effects caused by electrical arcing. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and Non-Dispersive X-ray Analysis surface-study techniques are used to examine the anode surface composition of powder metallurgy Ag-CdO contact materials. The microstructure and morphology changes which take place on the anode surface as a result of electrical arcing were observed using the Scanning Electron Microscope. Technical differences between the AES technique and the Non-Dispersive X-ray method are discussed in general; specific application to Ag-CdO contact material is included, The chemicai composition of two different contact materials that were studied is the same. However, electrical tests show that one material is more susceptible to welding than the other. The results show that, for both materials, the CdO concentration on the anode surface after electrical arcing is much larger than before. The amount and distribution of CdO in the arc spot area differs between the two materials. One material shows higher concentration of CdO in the periphery of the arc spot, the other material shows higher concentration in the central region. For the same arc energy, differences exist in the quantity of CdO found in the arced area."
"The low-load, dry circuit contact properties of typical tin plates have been investigated, with emphasis on the spherical indentor/flat configuration found in many connectors. The resistance was determined as a function of applied load for a variety Of plate combinations, as well as after exposure to a moist SO2accelerated corrosion test. The results Showed, among other things, that the contact behavior is critically dependent upon the properties of both halves of the contact system and that flats plated with matte tin behave better than those plated with bright tin."
"A new packaging method has been developed for microwave balanced stripline circuits which combines the advantages of numerically controlled drill techniques and the low cost wellknown methods of liquid resin molding. Microwave couplers were constructed using this technique which showed excellent mechanical properties and whose electrical properties were unchanged before and after potting."
"The contact resistance behavior of electrical contacts which were closed on oxide and sulfide contaminants is reported. The minimum wipe which is required to break through contaminants and to produce 'a minimum contact resistance is approximately equivalent to the diameter of the load-bearing area. The tendency of contaminant accumulations, which are formed at the front surface of the moving contact, to break away and pass between the contacts is correlated with the extent of wipe. Some implications of these results in the design of electrical contacts to function in contaminating environments are discussed."
"It has been found that the mercury wetting of metallic surface is insufficient to reduce friction, whereas the amalgamation of certain metals to form a mercury rich solid layer at the surface significantly reduces friction, contact resistance, and wear. Also, the amalgamation of metal alloys results in considerably lower friction than the amalgamation of the constituent metals separately. Coefficients of friction for eleven amalgamated metals and four alloys are presented. Laser interference fringe surface topography, contact resistances, coefficients of friction during 1 km of wipe, the associated wear, and the effects of temperature on friction are reported for an amalgamated palladium-silver alloy."
"An automated contact resistance measurement and recording system was designed and constructed for evaluating the dry-circuit performance of electrical contacts. To assure dry-circuit conditions the voltage across the contacts was limited to less than 30 millivolts regardless of contact resistance. The signal used to measure the resistance was a dc biased 400 Hertz sinusoid. The basic repetitive sequence of operation consisted of mechanically cycling the switch, then measuring and recording the contact resistance as falling within one of an adjustable set of five contiguous resistance ranges."
"A standard system of determining stress relaxation behavior in wrapped joints has been developed. The system uses extended length wrapped terminals with i00 turns of wire and monitors the elastic stress reduction in terms of the relaxation of axial twist in the terminal by means of an optical magnification technique. The effect of various joint parameters on stress relaxation behavior of secondary wrapped joints has been evaluated and correlated with Contact resistance changes observed in similar joints after quaiification approval testing. The effects of various wrapping wire Parameters and of terminal cross section On the stress relaxation behavior of primary Wrapped joints has also been investigated."
"In an effort to create a more reliable bond interface in hybrid microcircuits, a study was launched to evaluate the relative bond strengths of round wire and ribbon wire of comparable cross section, and to determine which is inherently more reliable after thermal degradation. This correspondence presents a comparative bonding reliability study of aluminum ribbon wire versus round wire, and gold ribbon wire versus round wire in hybrid microcircuits. The wires were ultrasonically bonded to thick film gold, thin film aluminum, thin film chromium-gold, and thin film molybdenumgold. Results showed that ribbon wire was superior to round wire and, that after 1000 hours of high temperature storage, aluminum round wire averaged 91% bond degradation on all types of substrates, while gold ribbon wire averaged 57% degradation. The average degradation of the wires on all of the substrate types is shown below in summarized form."
"The characteristics of electroplated and wrought gold-based contact materials for high reliability connectors in low energy circuit applications are reviewed. To insure that contacts do not degrade by film formation due to corrosion, diffusion, or wear processes, certain practices have evolved on the compositions, 'thicknesses, porosities, hardnesses and manufacturing methods for the golds, and for underplatings that are used with them. Recently, however, its escalating cost has stimulated intensive work which shows that the thickness of gold required for satisfactory performance can often be reduced. In addition, manufacturing techniques which selectively locate gold to the, mating area of a contact have come into vogue. Other routes to cost reduction include the use of nonnoble materials, palladium, or golds alloyed with large amounts of base metals."
"The concept of using separate load and output windings on small current transformers offers properties which may be useful in many applications. The principle feature of this method is that the resistance of the load winding itself serves as the entire load for the device. Several means of achieving such a configuration are suggested, including the use of bifilar windings and single-turn load windings made with bare wire or conductive coatings placed directly on the core. Desirable features of this method include economy of size and shape, and performance suitable for many applications. Limitations of performance exist for higher frequency conditions, but a considerable range of use is still available to the user."
"Reactions in rf sputtered W-Pt-W-A,u films on oxidized and unoxidized Si substrates have been analyzed using a micro-spot scanning Auger spectroscopy and microscopy technique. The analysis shows that the W-Pt-W-Au films on Si substrates have undergone three annealing stages resulting in gold-silicon eutectic formation and migration. Stage I (450°C, 12 hours) was characterized by the formation of Si rich globular regions on the Au film. During Stag,,, II (450°C, 24 hours) the entire unreacted gold film was consumed. Finally, during Stage III (550°C, 24 hourS) gold and the liquid phase eutectic migrated toward the metal-Si interface. For W-Pt-W-Au on oxidized Si substrates, the diffusion barrier of W-Pt-W was observed to be effective up to 550°C tot 24 hours."
"An approach to the problem of the non-ignitable and moisture resistant protective coating for electrical elements that use a double layer of coating composed of two different materials was investigated. The two materials are different in terms of the protection which they provide to the element. The first coating is truly non-burnable, inert, and is permeable to moisture, while the second coating is burnable and is nonpermeable to moisture. The important feature of the multicoat system introduced here is the particular effect of the burnable layer on the ignitability of the system. It has been experimentally demonstrated that as the thickness of either layer is increased, the ignitability of the system decreases. The system may be designed such that no flame appears on the surface of the assembly under any conditions and yet the electrical element is well protected against moisture."
"The resistivity of doped polycrystalline silicon films has been studied as a function of post deposition heat treatments in an oxidizing atmosphere. It was found that a short oxidation cycle may produce a resistivity increase as large as three orders of magnitude in the polycrystalline films. The extent of change was dependent on the initial resistivity and the films' doping level and was independent of the total oxidation time."
"Differential thermal expansion has been shown to be responsible for many observed failures in ceramic chip capacitors mounted on alumina substrates. The present work has shown that the mounting techniques used in bonding the capacitors have a marked effect upon the thermally induced mechanical stress and thus the failure rate. A mathematical analysis of a composite model of the capacitor-substrate system to predict the magnitude of thermally induced stresses have been conducted. It has been experimentally observed that the stresses in more compliant bonding systems such as soft lead/tin and indium solders are significantly lower than those in hard solder and epoxy systems. The marked dependence upon heating and cooling rate has proven to be a determining factor in the prediction of failure n both the indium and tin/lead solder systems. This study has shown that the harder or higher melting solders are less susceptible to thermal cycling effects but that they are more likely to fail during initial processing operations, in the course of the study, strain gage techniques were used to determine thermally induced expansion stresses of both the capacitors and the alumina substrates. Thus, the compliance of the different bonding mediums were determined. From the data obtained, several recommendations are made concerning the optimum bonding system for the achievement of maximum reliability."
"The strengths of thermocompression bonds made between gold plated copper lead frames and gold metallized thin film circuits decrease in time when aged at 200-300°C in air or vacuum unless there is a diffusion barrier (such as nickel) between the copper and gold. After pulling bonds to destruction, failure modes and failed surfaces were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Auger spectroscopy, electron microprobe, stylus probe, and X-ray diffraction. The failed surface on the substrate side of the bond was very rough, appearing to consist of \"mountains\" of almost pure Cu resting on a relatively smooth layer of grains, identified as Cu3Au, where the Cu3Au regions were Visible in the valleys between the copper mountains. The mating failed surface on the lead side of the bond was similarly rough, but with only a few scattered grains of Cu3Au evidently pulled out from the opposite surface. Oxidation, pore formation (Kirkendall effect), and ordered phase formation were considered as possible mechanisms for the degradation. Oxidation was ruled out by the observation that bonds degraded as fast in vacuum as in air. Ordered phase formation was judged more likely than pore formation as the primary mechanism. A parameter,\\tau, to describe the time required for measurable degradation was defined as the time for the average 90° peel strength of a 0.25 X 0.75 mm lead to decrease from six or seven pounds to four pounds. This parameter was found to be temperature activated with an activation energy of 0.8 eV. Since ordering and pore formation are both dominated by interdiffusion,\\tauwas extrapolated to lower temperatures using the diffusion coefficient measurements of Pinnel and Bennett, resulting in a value of ten years at 50°C. However, with a 5000Å ± 2500Å nickel diffusion barrier between the copper lead and the gold plate, the value of\\tauextrapolated to 50°C was considerably greater than 40 years, as desired in Bell System equipment."
"The recent development of a microshear test has made possible the quantitative study of the effect of surface contamination on thermocompression ball bonding of gold to gold metallization. Contarninant films were characterized by Auger electron spectroscopy and low energy ion spectroscopy. The thermocompression gold bonding process was found to be highly temperature dependent when organic films, which are barriers to metallic bonding, are present. Much of this temperature dependence could.be eliminated by rernoving the contaminant films by uV radiation prior to thermocompression bonding. Post-heat treatment resulted in the growth of metallic bond inter'faces, presumably by sintering mechanisms."
"The use of Rent's rule in assessing the economic trade-offs in partitioning electronic systems into larger or smaller units is described. The impact of this assessment on the size and number of connectors required is presented, The roles of non-separable (splicing) and separable (plug.in) connectors are discussed. A qualification procedure to assure reliability of non-separable connectors and current design practices to assure reliability of separable connectors are reviewed."
"Theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted on discrete resistors to determine the; power required to cause failure as a function of pulse width over the range 1µs to 10 ms. Single pulses of increasing amplitude were applied until voltage breakdown occurred, the resistor shattered, or until a resistance change of 5% or more took place. Carbon composition (both slug and film type), wire-wound (both precision and power type) and film resistors were tested. Computer calculations, temperature cycling test,% and field plots were utilized to interpret the results."
"Laser trimmed tantalum nitride thin film resistors age at a greater rate than untrimmed films. The high energy required to vaporize material in the cut, or' kerf, modifies the aging characteristics of film contiguous to the kerf. This undesirable feature could be mitigated if a design procedure were available to assure that end of life tolerances were manageable. In this paper a r. model is developed that relates end of life drift to the extent of laser machining. Experimental! data are used to obtain an aging model for material near the kerf and that parallel portion which is. more remote. It is found that precise definition for the boundary between these areas is not essential to complete characterization of the composite. The result is a graphical design procedure 'that assures laser trimmed resistors will meet end of life tolerance specifications. The analysis was extended to determine the position of \"L' cuts in bar resistors yielding optimum lifetime stability. It was found that trimming with an 'L' cut at the mid point of the resistor results in acceptably small deviations from maximum stability."
"An analysis is presented of the dependence of leak rates on geometry and flow mechanism. A combined-flow equation, valid for viscous, molecular, and diffusional flow is applied to capillary leaks and the results are extended to crack-shaped leaks and orifices. It is shown that for a given leak rate the geometry with the largest viscous contribution to flow is a single long capillary. A distinction is drawn between the rate at which a package leaks during helium leak test (in vacuum) and during use (in air at one atm pressure), and it is shown that the latter may be orders of magnitude smaller than the former because of the viscous contribution to flow during test and during bombing. Two different test procedures are proposed that are designed to prevent viscous flow by avoiding differences in total pressure: one is a one-atm \"bath\" instead of a \"bomb\" in radiotracer 85Kr, the other a gas-chromatographic collection of inert halogen-bearing gas that leaks out of a prefilled package. Both are predicted to give test leak rates within a factor of two of the use leak rates. Because of its widespread use and its complexity, the Howl and Mann molecular-flow equation is examined and a number of simplifying approximations are made to allow greater ease in its use. The time rate of change of pressure in a package is calculated using the simplifying approximation that leak rate is proportional only to difference in total or partial pressure, and the concept of maximum allowable dwell time for the \"marginal gross leaker\" is developed. Based on calculations of the rates of depressurization of a pressurized package, and of the rate of moisture accumulation in an unpressurized one, maximum allowable use leak rates RUfor a package of volume V, much lower than the currently used test leak rates, are proposed: Ru/V\\leq10-9atm sec-1for pressurized packages or Ru/V\\leq10-10for unpressurized ones. It is recognized that for most package volumes these levels are difficult to attain, but it is proposed that' less stringent limits fail in their intended purpose of guaranteeing hermeticity for a reasonable package life."
"A 'thin-film reactively bonded gold alloy has been developed. This material is similar in composition and physical properties to thick-film reactively bonded golds. It is a vacuum-deposited material that is fired in air at high temperatures (1000°C) to form a strong bond with ceramic substrates. Thin-film reactively bonded gold is a dense, smooth rhaterial with high electrical conductivity. This alloy can withstand repeated firings in the 850 to 1000° temperature range and is compatible with most thick-film materials including dielectrics, resistors and conductors. It can be ,easily etched into fine geometrics (very high yield with one-mil line and one-mil spaces), making it a good candidate for high density interconnect technology."
 "Summary form only given, as follows. This issue of the IEEE Transactions on Parts, Hybrids, and Packaging is the fourth annual issue that will be devoted to papers that have been selected from those presented at the 1975 Electronic Components Conference.

"The inorganic constituents of seventeen commerical gold-based conductor inks have been chemically analyzed in detail. A variety of techniques were employed including a precursor bake of ink samples in oxygen, which burned off the organic vehicles, followed by wet chemical analysis to determine the proportion of gold in the inorganic solids of the inks. Solids mass spectrometry and optical emission spectrometry were used to define the relative amounts of other elements present. Atomic absorption spectrometry was then employed, where applicable, to more precisely define the proportions of important binder constituents in the inks. The paper briefly describes each of the analytical methods used and refers to more detailed descriptions of each method. Descriptions are given of innovative laboratory techniques used to perform the study and with the other material given and referenced should enable the reader to duplicate the analyses. The detailed results of the analyses are presented in tabular form. The data are normalized into weight proportions of the noble metals and of the binders in oxide form. The results of the ink analyses are discussed in terms of a set of criteria, which makes the analyses somewhat easier to understand."
"The continued increase in the cost of precious metals such as palladium and gold has stimulated increased interest in the development of lower cost, but equally reliable, substitutes for noble metal thin film conductor systems such as Ti-Pd-Au. This paper discusses a Ti-Cu-Ni-Au (TCNA) substitute which eliminates the use of Pd and reduces the thickness of gold necessary for a .005 ohms per square sheet resistance from 5µm to\\leq2µm. The reduction in gold thickness can result in considerable cost savings. The TCNA films were deposited by plating, i.e., electron gun evaporation of Ti and Cu followed by the plating of Cu-Ni-Au. The results of TCNA film aging and resistor aging with TCNA at 150°C and 250°C, bondability, adherence, corrosion resistance in air + dry and wet (5% RH) HCl, SO2, and NO2environments, solderability, and humidity testing (85°C, 85% RH) under bias for encapsulated and unencapsulated TCNA conductors have been found to be comparable to the Ti-Pd-Au system. Nickel in the range of 1 µm if non-porous is a barrier to the diffusion of copper to the gold surface at the temperatures (150-350°C) and times of interest in bilevel Hybrid Integrated Circuit (H lC) fabrication. In addition to its role as a diffusion barrier, nickel also acts as a corrosion inhibitor like Pd in the Ti-Pd-Au system."
"A versatile thin film metallization technique in which both gold and aluminum can be incorporated on sapphire or fine grained alumina substrates in a two level metallization system with thin film resistors is described. Tungsten is used as a lateral transition metal permitting electrical contact between the gold and aluminum without the two metals coming in physical contact. Silicon dioxide serves as an insulator between the tungsten and aluminum for crossover purposes and vias through the silicon dioxide permit interconnections where desired. Tantalum nitride is deposited first and serves as the resistor film. Sheet resistance of the film is typically 100 ohms per square. Tungsten-gold is the first level conductor except at crossovers where tungsten only is used. Aluminum is the second level conductor. Sheet resistances of the two conductor levels can be as Iow as 0.01 ohm/square. I inewidths and spaces as small as 0.025 mm can be attained. A second layer of silicon dioxide is deposited over the metallization and opened for all gold and aluminum bonding areas. The metallization system permits effective interconnection of a mixture of devices having both gold and aluminum terminations without creating undesirable gold-aluminum interfaces. Devices can be attached by epoxy or silicone directly on the circuitry. Processing temperatures up to 400°C can be tolerated for short times without effect on bondability, resistor, conductor, and insulator characteristics, thus permitting silicon-gold eutectic die attachment, component soldering, and higher temperatures during gold lead bonding. Tests conducted on special test pattern circuits indicate good stability over the temperature range--55°C to +150°C. Aging studies showed no degradation in characteristics in tests of 500 hours duration at 150°C."
"Stability characteristics of nickel-chromium thin film resistors have been measured for power densities ranging up to 4500 W/in2Resistance change was found to depend on resistor temperature, sheet resistance and substrate Wpe. For 220\\Omega/sq films the time for a one percentresistance change, t1\\approx3.8 X 10-14exp(16820/T), where t1is in h and T is mean resistor temperature in °K. Resistors with 4 X 10-5in2area, deposited on glazed alumina, increase 0.04°C for each W/in2power density. Consequently, for room temperature ambient t1\\approx,1.7X 105h (20 years)at 2000 W/in2(0.08W). Resistors on as-fired alumina run cooler (0.01°C/W/in2) and therefore have higher values of t1Top-hat trimmed resistors developed hot spots which caused failures at ~1000 W/in2. Modified trim configurations were tested and shown to avoid these failures."
"This paper reviews several time dependent reliability limitations of aluminum thin film metallization used on semiconductor devices., For each of the degradation modes, the present level of understanding as well as engineerlng data are presented. First, interactions of aluminum with the underlying silicon substrate, with silicon dioxide, and with gold are discussed. Then the time dependent degradation phenomena of electromigration, surface reconstruction, and corrosion are reviewed. A good understanding of all these limitations is important in the construction of reliable devices using this metallization."
"The recent development of photovoltaic IR detectors made from thin films of IV-VI semiconductors, such as PbTe on BaF2substrates has necessitated the development of a new type of header. The most significant requirements were for face down mounting to permit illumination through the BaF2substrate and for Compatibility with the unusually large thermal expansion of the devices\\alpha\\approx2 X 105°K-l)when the devices are cycled in the' range of 300 to 77°K. The thermal expansion was successfully matched using a 4 structure that was predominately copper. The face down i mounting was obtained by flip-chip bonding to solder bumps i dammed by chromium on copper pads that were delineated ., from the foil component of a copper/copper sealing glass/ copper foil sandwich,"
"The flow stress of a high purity gold has been determined so that the contribution of plastic flow to the gold<jold thermocompression bonding process can be evaluated. These compression tests at 25°C, 158°C, 311°C, and 458°C indicate that for deformations over 15% the flow stress and the work hardening coefficient decrease rapidly with increasing temperature. Correlation of the compression test results and beam lead bonding experience indicates that high purity golds having a hardness of about 30 DPH would be expected to reach a steady state uniaxial flow stress of 70-90 MPa (10,000-13,000 psi) when deformed during bonding at 300°C."
"Encapsulated printed wiring board assemblies which are subjected to thermal cycling may be prone to the problem of solder joint cracking. In order to quantitatively assess the susceptibility and resulting reliability of these electronic packages, a series of tests were conducted. Several test units were designed to evaluate various material and design variables. Thermal cycling (-40°F to + 160°F) of these test Units with periodic visual and/or electrical examination of each solder joint resulted in a systematic comparison of several variables with regard to influence On solder joint cracking. Within the limitations of the test conditions, several recommendations can be made to advise designers of the design and production practices to minimize damage to solder joints"
"An evaluation program is described for selecting epoxy adhesives for use in hybrid microelectronics assemblies. A simple, effective screening method has been devised which allows the selection of a minimum set of epoxy adhesives that provides all the essential adhesives functions. The final selection of the adhesives is verified by physical testing of the adhesives in selected typical applications. The importance of initially determining the explicit adhesive requirements of the user's hybrid assembly is stressed as a tool for selection of epoxies to be screened. Experimental details of the screening process are described. The selection of epoxies for evaluation is derived by a process of elimination from the experimental results"
"This paper describes the development and characteristics of a new aluminum solid electrolytic capacitor in which organic semiconductors are substituted for manganese dioxide. The highly conductive ion-radical salts based on 7, 7, 8, 8-tetracyanoquinodimethan were chosen because of their prominent effect on capacitor self-healing. The solid electrolyte layer of a thin uniform coating was deposited from a solution of the semiconductor and polymers. A basic approach to obtaining a uniform and adherent film suitable for an etched aluminum foil is given, along with limitations on the use of the organic semiconductor. Emphasis is placed on the effect of the polymers on the growth and adsorption of the organic-semiconductor crystals during electro formation. Much improvement was realized in capacitor performance, viz. the Iow leakage current, the extended ratio of breakdown-to-formation voltage, and stable frequency characteristics. It may be concluded from the laboratory experiments that production of high-performance organic semiconductor solid capacitors will probably be feasible in the near future"
"Summary form only given, as follows. All electronic components and devices are built from materials. The designer however, is primarily concerned with circuit design and, in general, little concerned about whether the material construction is face-centered cubic or hexagonal close packed. Unfortunately, the material properties (as crystal structure) are critical at times, and many a design failure is attributed to \"lousy materials.\" Ideally, we should design materials as well as circuits, but practically few of us have time or interest to delve into all the aspects of a component construction. For that we rely on materials and other specialists to help us out of trouble. This issue of the TRANSACTIONS is intended for designers, and published with the intent of providing some background on materials. The articles proceed from thick film basic compositions, through thin film materials, from passive to active devices to bonding of the devices, and conclude with a description of a component requiring special materials considerations. We hope this issue provides meaningful information. Comments on the contents of this issue and suggestions for subsequent materials issues would be appreciated so we can organize papers to fit your needs. Please send any suggestions to one of the guest editors."
 "Thick-film hybrid integrated circuit process currently being used to realized complex circuit functions in hybrid form is discussed. The thick-film technology, active device attachment, and packaging all play important roles in the overall systems approach. A description of the various processes will be presented starting with the ceramic substrate and ending with the completed package. Extensive use is made of computer-controlled laser trimming for both static trimming of resistors and functional trimming of modules after assembly. When properly used, the laser is a powerful tool. Active devices are attached using a solder-reflow technique. All of the connections on the active devices are terminated using solder bumps consisting of a tin/lead alloy. There are corresponding land areas on the ceramic substrate that have been coated with a tin/lead solder. The land areas on the substrate are designed in such a way as to restrict the solder wetting to the small area around the terminal similar to the IBM, \"controlled collapse\" process [1]. The techniques employed result in thick-film hybrid integrated circuits that are economical, reliable, high in yield, and offer considerable flexibility to the hybrid manufacturer."
  "It has been reported that the ratio of the diameter to the height of a reflow soldered flip-chip pad should be less than 2:l [1], [2]. This geometry permits a ductile material to accept the strain caused by differences in thermal expansion coefficients of silicon and alumina. However, to deposit sufficient material on a semiconductor chip to achieve this geometry has usually meant chip pad redesign and the resulting costly mask changes. This paper describes methods of depositing SUfficient material on a thick film substrate to permit use of chips with reduced bump volume. Details in the paper describe the volume calculations and artwork design for deposition of solder creme by screen printing. Selection and deposition of a dielectric glaze material to limit the area Of solder wetting on the substrate pads in also described. The test vehicle used in the study is a simple 2-bit counter utilizing 14MECL gates. It was fabricated in multilayer format for comparison of operating parameters between eutectic back bonded and solder reflow face bonded chips."
"The current design trend in thick film hybrids is toward larger substrate size and narrower conductor lines. This paper documents the results of a study undertaken to determine the effect of line width and spacing, substrate size, and conductor length on the occurrence of common screen printing defects. Development of a screen printing test pattern and a data reduction software routine are also described. Recommendations for selection of line width/spacing and substrate size are presented."
"In the last few years the use of small accelerators for ion implantation has been firmly established as an important manufacturing process in the fabrication of microelectronic devices and circuits. Before 1968 the only machines available for implantation were those designed originally for nuclear research, isotope separation, or neutron generation and adapted for implantation purposes. Since then, equipment has evolved to meet the specific needs of commercial applications. This paper discusses certain accelerator components where the changes have been most pronounced."
"This paper surveys the development of in-circuit testing over the past decade and examines the reasons as to why this production floor technique for test and fault diagnosing of printed wiring assemblies has taken hold. Both controller based and minicomputer based in-circuit test systems are discussed, and reasons are advanced as to why minicomputer based in-circuit systems are becoming popular. Some of the reasons presented are their ability to employ the simple programming languages such as Basic. Moreover, users may readily add functional testing to a minicomputer based in-circuit test system by interfacing some of the programmable instruments now on the market with the input-output bus and the in-circuit test fixture. It is also pointed out that minicomputer based in-circuit test systems provide the capability to generate in-circuit test Programs by an operator, unschooled in minicomputer programming, who merely enters data from engineering documents. A test program generator generates the tests in the proper testing sequence. The paper Concludes with a discussion as to how in-circuit and functional testing can be combined effectively for optimizing test and fault diagnostic capability."
"The design of electronic products has been revolutionized, in recent years, by the introduction of various \"state-of-the-art\" concepts and technology changes. This continually accelerating trend of technical innovation has, perhaps, had a tendency to cloud the significance and relative importance of some of the fundamental concepts involved in the expression \"producibility of design.\" \"Producibility,\" specifically with respect to the cost connotations implied, is necessarily associated with standardization of materials, components, and operations which, in turn, become the basis for extended mechanization and automation of the operations. A corollary to this process is the necessity for improved data management at the design-manufacturing interface and, in a sense, the standardization and automation of the data and data handling techniques involved."
"Automatic test equipment for 100 percent incoming inspection of electronic devices is inexpensive enough and effective enough today that sample testing no longer makes sense for most quality-control organizations. Although component manufacturers normally perform 100 percent inspection--at least in the early stages of manufacture--there are a great many ways in which errors can be passed along to the user. As a result, incoming digital integrated circuits (IC's) may have error rates as high as 5 percent and, for linear ICes, rejection rates may be up to 10 percent. Nor do acceptable quality levels (AQL's) provide a positive assurance of the quality of a lot, as is pointed out in an appendix. Break even is basically the point at which the cost of testing meets the cost of not testing. It is often expressed as the number of units that must be tested per year to justify a piece of automatic test equipment. Both the cost of testing and the cost of not testing can be calculated quite easily once the various factors to be used are considered."
"Starting with huge one of a kind expensive systems designed for the military, there exists today a large variety of commercial equipment which does the same basic job for a lot less money. System sophistication varies from go/no-go testors to diagnostic systems which lead the operator to the defective component."
"The use of computers by industry in operations and products is undergoing a fundamental change. The change has been made possible by technological advances in integrated circuits and software. Cost and performance trends of small (mini) and large (maxi) computers are such that future systems will be distributed and hierarchical. Both computer power and data bases (mass storage) will be distributed. The hierarchy will cover from business host functions to control on the factory floor. The integrated and on-line nature of future systems promises to increase greatly the timeliness and quality of operational data available to decision makers and lead to increased productivity. The information structure of manufacturing information and control systems will be applicable to the products of some companies."
"This paper discusses the applications and architectural features of a sequential pattern generator designed for a general-purpose high-speed large-scale integration (LSI) test system. This system provides enhanced capabilities for testing communications-microprocessor-oriented LSI devices which require long test patterns and flexible input-output (I-O) control of individual pins. Salient features discussed are a 10 MHz random access memory with an 80-bit word size and controller capable of 100 ns subroutine calls and loops in unlimited numbers. Also, individual pin changes such as I-O states, timing, and waveform format at 10 MHz rates are de- scribed."
"Currently, many manufacturing functions are automated through the use of computers and associated equipment. The support of ,administrative functions such as material and labor control to regulate costs and measure results is aided by the use of medium to large computers at the plant site or through communications to a central computer site. The control of processes, such as testing and assembly, are improved through the use of mini- and microprocessors' as well as programmable controllers. The engineering problem solving and design now involve the use of hand-held and desktop calculators as well as time-shared and remote processing on a central computer. All of these things have but one basic goal: cost effective manufacturing. This article outlines one possible path for advancement toward that goal, based on existing applications and computer systems capabilities. As always, the final challenge is related to our ability to cost effectively design and implement the processes which use the tools we have or can acquire."

"The synthesis of a prescribed far-field pattern by means of a radiating slot in a perfectly conducting infinite circular cylinder is considered. The narrow circumferential slot and the infinite axial slot are studied in detail. In either case, the problem is to find the distribution of the electromagnetic field in the aperture that yields a radiation pattern that is the best mean-square approximation to a given pattern, under certain constraints. Various quality factors for cylindrical modes are discussed, and a detailed comparison with the synthesis problem for a planar aperture is performed. It turns out that Rhodes' synthesis method has no equivalent in the cylindrical case, and that the best admissible mean-square approximation to a given pattern may be a very poor approximation in amplitude. However, an iteration scheme is developed in which the phase approximation is sacrificed for the sake of substantially improving the amplitude approximation. Numerical results based on such a scheme are displayed, for prescribed omnidirectional and sectoral patterns."
"An efficient computational technique for obtaining scattering cross sections of electrically small aircraft is presented. The technique is based on the wire-grid reaction method. The aircraft shape is approximated by a grid of thin wires, leading to a mathematical representation of the aircraft in the form of an impedance matrix. The inverted matrix yields the scattering data. A variety of wire-grid models were tested. The results show that with proper choice of radius of the wire segments, good agreement with experimental data can be obtained for polarizations parallel to the fuselage axis. For polarizations perpendicular to the fuselage axis, only fair agreement was observed. This computational technique is used to simulate realistic scattering data, which serves as input to information processors for target identification."
"Corrugated horns use corrugations on theE-plane walls that are operating in the cutoff condition. In this paper, attention is focussed on replacing the rectangular shaped corrugation with a V-shaped corrugation. The properties of the V corrugations are obtained using an integral equation solution; the results of the computational studies indicate that for operation of the V corrugations in the forbidden zone the depth of the corrugations lie between0.3125 \\lambdato 0.625\\lambdain contrast to the rectangular corrugations where the corresponding depth is0.25 \\lambdato 0.5\\lambda. The radiation patterns and impedance of two identical rectangular horns with corrugatedE- plane walls using either V or rectangular corrugations are directly compared."
 "This is a new technique proposed to improve the performance of a troposcatter system. In this technique, the transmitting or receiving antenna, or both, are continuously scanning the space to find the scattering volume that produces the optimal signal strength. The overall effect is to reduce both short-term and long-term fadings. It is equivalent to a combination of using selection angle diversity for short-term fast fading and increasing system margin for long-term slow fading, by picking up the best signal. An extensive experimental study is suggested."
"The impedance of a simple open slot antenna was measured as a function of frequency and was then compared with the theoretical values obtained through Babinet's principle from the known values of the admittance of its complementary antenna, the strip dipole. A careful experimental study was then made of the impedance of the same slot with several different cavity backings. The impedance was found both as a function of frequency and of the various parameters of the cavity, namely, the cross-sectional size of the cavity, the medium filling the cavity, and the type of termination of the cavity."
"Active microwave measurements of vegetation backscatter were conducted to determine the utility of radar in 1) mapping soil moisture through vegetation and 2) mapping crop types. Using a truck-mounted boom, spectral response data were obtained for four crop types (corn, milo, soybeans, and alfalfa) over the 4-8 GHz frequency band, at incidence angles of0\\deg-70\\degin10\\degsteps, and for all four linear polarization combinations. Based on a total of 125 data sets covering a wide range of soil moisture content, system design criteria are proposed for each of the aforementioned objectives. Quantitative soil moisture determination was best achieved at the lower frequency end of the 4-8 GHz band using HH polarized waves in the5\\deg-15\\degincidence angle range. A combination of low and high frequency measurements are suggested for classifying crop types. For crop discrimination, a dual-frequency dual-polarization (VV and cross) system operating at incidence angles above40\\degis suggested."
"The trap-loaded cylindrical antenna is a cylindrical antenna having one or more traps located in its arms. The traps are either parallel inductor-capacitor circuits or short-circuited transmission line stubs that are designed to be antiresonant (having essentially an infinite input impedance) at some particular frequency. The location and the antiresonant frequency of the traps are selected to enhance the radiation pattern or input impedance of the antenna. This study is confined to the properties of trap-loaded cylindrical antennas that contain only one trap in each arm. The effect of the length of the outer section, length of the inner section, diameter of the cylinder and characteristic impedance or inductance-capacitance ratio of the trap on the input impedance, radiation pattern, and current distribution were studied both experimentally and with the aid of two numerical solutions of an integral equation for the current distribution. The conclusions drawn from this study are that the design procedure for the multiband trap antenna described by Greenberg [1], adjusting the antiresonant frequency of the trap to control the upper resonant frequency, is indeed valid. Graphs suitable for designing trap antennas using this procedure are available in this paper. Furthermore, it is shown that the characteristic impedance or inductance-capacitance ratio of the trap can also be adjusted to vary the lower resonant frequency of the antenna. Design graphs using this procedure are also available in this paper. This study also showed that a relatively wide range of upper to lower antenna resonant frequency ratios can be obtained while still maintaining radiation patterns and input impedances close to those of a half-wave dipole at both frequencies. Graphs are available showing the tradeoff in pattern shape and input impedance that must be made to obtain resonant frequency ratios other than 2 to 1. It was discovered that the trap antenna, sometimes called a Franklin array, must be operated somewhat below the nominal design frequency or have the spacing between traps shortened somewhat, for it to have a radiation pattern similar to a collinear array of half-wave dipoles. Furthermore, the thicker the antenna, the more pronounced this effect is. While the nominal design was discovered to give an input impedance nearly resistive and near70\\Omega(for a dipole), any of the aforementioned modifications resulted in a nonresonant highly capacitive input impedance."
"An analytical method is developed for the maximization of the directivity of a Yagi-Uda array by adjusting the lengths of the dipole elements. The effects of a finite dipole radius and the mutual coupling between the elements are taken into consideration. Currents in the array elements are approximated by three-term expansions with complex coefficients that convert the governing integral equations into matrix equations. Array directivity is maximized by a perturbation procedure that adjusts the lengths of all array elements simultaneously and that converges very rapidly. This method can be combined with the previously developed spacing-perturbation method to form a double-perturbation procedure and obtain a Yagi-Uda array of nonuniformly spaced elements of unequal lengths. which yields a maximum directivity."
"Work done severe years ago, which represents a step toward eliminating the necessity for subdividing a phased array aperture into many discrete elements, each with its own phase shifter, is reported on for the first time. A 5-wavelength,Xband horn aperture, partially loaded with ferrite material, was designed and fabricated. The resulting antenna replaces at least 10 conventional phase shifter-element units and was successfully controlled by an external magnetic circuit to form sum and difference patterns and to scan the beam."
"In a medium of high permittivity or conductivity, such as sea water, lake water, or wet earth, a dielectric coated antenna can produce a directional radiation pattern when the coating is eccentric. The current distribution on a finite or infinite dipole with such a coating is obtained. Formulas for the directivity and the radiation pattern of an infinitely long dipole with eccentric coating are also derived."
"A technique for combining moment methods with the geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) is presented, which permits the application of the method of moments to a larger class of problems. The fundamental idea used to develop the hybrid technique is to modify the usual impedance matrix that characterizes, for example, a wire antenna such that a metallic body or discontinuity on that body is properly accounted for. It is shown in general that one can modify the impedance matrix for any basis and/or weighting functions if one can compute the correct modification to the impedance matrix element. The modification is readily accomplished using the geometrical theory of diffraction and/or geometrical optics. Several example problems are considered to illustrate the usefulness of the technique. First, the canonical problem of a monopole near a conducting wedge is investigated. Second, a monopole at the center of a four-sided and an eight-sided flat plate is considered. Impedance results for the latter case are in good agreement with measurements. Third, a monopole at the center of a circular disc is examined and compared with experimental measurements in the literature, and fourth, the problem of a monopole near a conducting step is solved and the dependence of the input impedance upon the step height shown."
"The output of a radio interferometer is the Fourier transform of the object under investigation. Due to the limited coverage of the Fourier plane the reconstruction of the image of the source is blurred by the beam of the synthesized array. In this paper a maximum-likelihood processing technique is described that uses the statistical properties of the received noise-like signals. This technique has been used extensively in the processing of large aperture seismic arrays. This inversion method results in a synthesized beam that is more uniform, has lower sidelobes, and higher resolution than the normal Fourier transform methods. The maximum-likelihood method (MLM) algorithm was applied successfully to very long baseline (VLB) and short baseline interferometric data."
"The solution to the problem of scattering of a plane wave by an infinite periodic array of thin conductors on a dielectric slab is formulated in this paper. Numerical results are given as well as a comparison of this theory with experimental data."
"Propagation and radiation of electromagnetic waves from oscillating sources in a suddenly created plasma are studied in this investigation. Field expressions are derived through the use of Laplace transformations. The spatial distribution of sources is taken to be arbitrary but confined. Two cases are considered in detail: 1) plane wave propagation in a source-free region and 2) electric point dipole radiation. In the case of plane wave propagation, various aspects such as wave split, frequency shift, phase and group velocities, amplitude changes, power flows, and energy relations are discussed. In the case of electric dipole radiation, the electromagnetic fields and instantaneous radiated power are calculated and expressed in terms of Lommel functions of two variables. Asymptotic expressions and graphical results of numerical calculations of these quantities are presented. Many interesting properties of the spherical waves and power radiation are discussed."
"The scattering of a plane electromagnetic wave by an electron-plasma column rotating around its axis in the presence of a static magnetic field is discussed on the basis of Maxwell's equations and the constitutive relations for a rotating electron plasma derived from the electron-theoretical consideration. For two special cases, that where a plane wave is normally incident upon a rotating electron-plasma column without axial drift and that where a plane wave is obliquely incident upon an electron-plasma column rotating with the Larmor frequency and drifting in the axial direction, the scattering properties of a rotating electron-plasma column are investigated in detail with the aid of numerical examples. From the numerical examples for the backscattering cross section and the scattering pattern, it is found that there appear various interesting phenomena that are characteristic of a rotating electron-plasma column."
"Microstrip antennas consist of a planar resonant radiating element parallel to, but separated, from a ground plane by a thin dielectric substrate (t \\ll \\lambda). These antennas are very thin and consequently rugged and easy to mount. They may be fed from the back through the ground plane or from the edge by depositing microstrip lines on the dielectric substrate. Several varieties of microstrip antennas are discussed in this paper. Design procedures are given for both linearly and circularly polarized antennas. Measured patterns are presented for antennas from UHF throughCband."
"Dolph's method for determining the optimum element currents for half-wavelength equispaced discrete linear arrays is generalized to symmetric discrete linear arrays. The theorem proved gives sufficient conditions for the existence of optimum beam patterns for arrays with elements symmetrically positioned about the array center, but with fixed unequal spacings between the elements. The conditions are such that the Remes exchange algorithm for minimax approximation of functions can be employed to compute the optimum element currents corresponding to an optimum beam pattern directly from the given spacings of the elements. Half-wavelength spaced linear arrays satisfy the conditions of the theorem; therefore, it provides a new method of calculating the well-known Dolph-Chebyshev element currents. An example with unequal spacings is included to show the utility of the method even when the hypotheses of the theorem may not be met."
"A design method is described for the creation of line sources that will yield antenna patterns consisting of a narrow main beam and low sidelobes, with the sidelobe levels different on the two sides of the main beam. The requisite aperture distribution is shown to be symmetrical in amplitude and asymmetrical in phase. Main beam offset and the characteristics of the associated difference pattern are discussed. The boresight error voltage curve is also displayed. Incremental gain resulting from asymmetric sidelobes is analyzed and data is given for typical cases. Experimental confirmation is, presented."
"A method is described for the determination of the parameters of an assumed ionospheric profile from a given measured impulse response function. In the considered examples the measured data are simulated by ray tracing techniques and the least mean square method is applied iteratively to solve the inverse problem. Measurements errors and horizontal dependence of the ionospheric profile are also considered along with the effect of the choice of the starting values of the assumed profile parameters."
"The problem of reflection of electromagnetic waves from oscillating surfaces is discussed. Using the induction theorem, the interface is replaced by equivalent current sources that radiate into an unbounded medium. Spatial movement is ascribed to these sources to account for oscillations of the surface. The general solution for the far-field due to any arbitrary surface motion is developed. A few deterministic and random functions for surface motion are considered. Most of the initial discussion pertains to normal reflection from planar surfaces, but the solution is also obtained for arbitrary incidence and for an oscillating cylinder."
"A method for computing the resonant region scattering by slender axisymmetric objects with arbitrary surface impedance is outlined. This method employs matching of the electric and magnetic fields on axis. Results obtained by this method have been used to generate contour maps of radar cross section (RCS) as a function of frequency and aspect. Maps for three conducting cones and a cone-spheroid covering the diameter-to-wavelength range of 0.05 to 0.70 are shown. The relationship of the high and low frequency asymptotic behavior to the mapped results is discussed. Computed and measured RCS patterns are compared."
"Although the T-bar fed slot antenna is not new, little information is available that would enable one to systematically design such an antenna. It is the purpose of this paper to determine the important parameters in the design process and what tradeoffs may be made among bandwidth, low VSWR, and physical size."
"The reflection of a pulse by two dielectric slabs is treated both analytically and numerically. The reflected wave is obtained by expanding the reflection coefficient of an elementary plane wave in a series, including the special case for which total reflection occurs. The effect of the carrier frequency of a pulse-modulated carrier wave on the reflected wave form is also discussed."
"Radio transmission and reception experiments conducted in a tropical jungle are described. The performance of conventional whip antennas is compared with the performance of trees utilized as antennas in conjunction with hybrid electromagnetic antenna couplers (HEMAC's). The trees were found to outperform the whip in some cases by up to 20 dB."
"Radio wave propagation predictions are described in which modern comprehensive theoretical ionospheric models are coupled with ray-tracing programs. In the computer code described, a network of electron density and collision frequency parameters along a band about the great circle path is calculated by specifying the transmitter and receiver geographic coordinates, time, the day number, and the 2800-MHz solar flux. The ray paths are calculated on specifying the frequency, mode, range of elevation angles, and range of azimuth angles from the great circle direction. The current program uses a combination of the Penn State MKIEandFregion models and the Mitra-RoweDandEregion model. Application of the technique to the prediction of satellite to ground propagation and calculation of oblique incidence propagation paths and absorption are described. The implications of the study to the development of the next generation of ionospheric models are discussed."
"Exact algebraic expressions available for the oblique-ray path parameters of a quasi-parabolic ionospheric layer are used to present a systematic procedure for the synthesis of oblique ionograms for the layer."
"Expressions for the antenna temperature are derived for a scanning Earth-viewing satellite-borne microwave radiometer. The result is in the form of an integral that includes the antenna gain function and brightness temperature. A composite emissivity term appears in the brightness temperature equation that contains the horizontal and vertical components of surface emissivity weighted by their respective antenna gains. Analysis is performed to obtain the antenna temperature components corresponding to the emission of horizontally and vertically polarized radiation. Calculations are performed showing the effects of beam width and scan angle on the two components of antenna temperature for a linearly polarized antenna. Effects resulting from antenna cross polarization are also analyzed."
"A thin wall leaky waveguide antenna (TLA) obtained by replacing one of the narrow walls of a rectangular waveguide by a film of metal with thickness less than the skin depth is discussed. The radiation pattern for TLA has been evaluated by using Kirchhoff-Huygens approach. In using this method, the dispersion relation has been solved for the complex propagation constants in a parallel plate waveguide with an imperfect plate (\\sigma < \\infty), the thickness of which is less than the skin depth. Separate approximate expressions for the propagation constants for TEM,TM_{n0}, andTE_{n0}modes in this parallel plate structure have been obtained by considering the mode of propagation as a perturbation of the waveguide mode. Experimental results atXband frequencies with thin bismuth films are reported and are found to be in fair agreement with the theoretical results. Phase velocity (c/\\upsilon) variation of TLA is essentially that of a simple rectangular waveguide. Very low values of attenuation constant can be obtained so that a long antenna can be used even with the beam directed away from endfire."
"In order to extend the active reflection coefficient of a phased array to general scan angles from measurements on a multielement phased array waveguide simulator, a new interpolation technique using rounded ramp functions (RRPF's) is presented. The interpolation formula is tested on an array, simulated by a 25-element simulator, with stripline-fed slots as radiating elements. Contour plots showing the magnitude and the phase of the active reflection coefficient are included. The described interpolation scheme gives a much smoother behavior than a Fourier series expansion published earlier."
"The expression for the expected isolation between two orthogonally polarized signals of a single beam frequency reuse array antenna when excitation, position, and orientation of the elements are subjected to independent random variables is derived. The isolation loss and the fundamental limitation of a multibeam frequency reuse antenna system are discussed."

"The program to use the Crawford Hill sun tracker for measurement of attenuation on the earth-space path at 13, 19, and 30 GHz is described. Cumulative attenuation statistics for a year of data are presented, along with a discussion of likely sources of error. The results of the data analysis can be briefly summarized. 1) The extrapolation procedure proposed by Hogg, wherein attenuation measurements at two frequencies are used to predict attenuation at a third, yields results in good agreement with observation except at very high attenuation levels. 2) Because of limits on the measuring range of the sun tracker, more accurate estimates of fading statistics for fades >30 dB at 30 GHz can probably be made by extrapolation than by direct measurement."
"A cost function is given for the optimization of the directivity of an antenna array while simultaneously achieving the flat behavior over the wide range of frequencies. The optimization of a six-element Yagi antenna resulted in a virtually flat directivity over the bandwidth of 33 percent. The allowable tolerances on element lengths of the optimized antenna are 0.25 percent or larger."
"A technique is presented for calculating the potential integral of thin-wire theory at the singularity of the exact kernel in cases where the current is representable as piecewise constant and/or piecewise linear over an interval containing the singularity. The integral of the rapidly varying portion of the kernel is converted to a highly convergent power series. Examples of how one employs the results in computations are given."
"Calculations are presented of the bias and spread of the angle estimator of an amplitude comparison monopulse radar caused by propagation through a layer that contains random index of refraction fluctuations. These fluctuations, caused by irregularities between a target and a receiver, bias the angle estimator towards boresight and cause a spread in the measurements of both on- and off-boresight angles. To illustrate the general results simplified expressions are given for Gaussian antenna patterns, targets near boresight, and a simple power-law irregularity spectrum. Comparisons with other models of angular jitter show that the mean square angular fluctuation observed with an amplitude comparison monopulse radar is closely related to the angular fluctuation, which is predicted when the averaging effect of a radar aperture is considered."
"The main beam, sidelobe levels, and effective collecting area of a proposed radio telescope array, operating at 12 MHz, are considered. The telescope consists of two large rectangular arrays containing several thousand half-wave dipoles arranged horizontally in a tee shape above a ground plane. A narrow beam is formed by cross-correlating the outputs of the individual arms of the tee. The possibility of sidelobe reduction using a form of physical tapering consisting of reducing the width of each rectangular arm at appropriate intervals along the array is assessed, by comparing the performance achieved with this type of taper to that obtainable with the more common resistive taper. It is concluded that when the effects of random errors in element excitation are considered the performance of the physically tapered and resistively tapered arrays compares favorably."
"The minimum directivity of a multiple-beam antenna is an important design parameter of the related communications system. This parameter is a function of the spacing between the feeds of a focusing device. In this communication it is shown that the minimum directivity can be optimized by the proper choice of feed spacing."
"A resistive input impedance transmitting antenna system with a total dipole height of\\lambda/2000instead of the conventional\\lambda/2has been built and compared with a passive dipole of equal height. The active network-antenna combination is extremely broadband and is capable of working at frequencies well below those where inductively loaded passive antennas can readily be made."
"The use of piecewise sinusoids for expansion functions and rectangular pulses for testing functions is described in the application of the method of moments to thin-wire antennas and scatterers. This choice of expansion and testing functions allows efficient calculation of matrix elements and yields accurate results for certain widths of the testing function. However, for other widths, although the standard criteria for the selection of these functions are satisfied, erroneous results are obtained. The validity of the moment method solution can be checked by examining the near-field."
"The transient electric field response of a step-function current excited cable lying on the surface of a homogeneous and isotropic earth is considered. Attention is focused upon that portion of the response at the earth's surface where the field is either constant or decaying with time. This information appears to have application in the measurement of the earth's conductivity using a single cable with finite length and grounded at both ends. Then, by superposition, the response of an array of equally spaced parallel cables is also studied."
"In the past, fast Fourier transforms (FFT's) have been used in geophysical data analysis and, with some success, in theoretical analysis. However, in the general situation when neither the function nor its transform image is of compact support, the digital transforms inevitably introduce aliasing errors in both the domain and range space. A technique to assess and minimize this error is given for a restricted set of functions."
"The center-to-limb brightness distribution of the sun at radio wavelengths gives information about the structure of the solar atmosphere. Radio telescopes have poor spatial resolution, however, and cannot provide detailed angular measurements of the brightness distribution. During a solar eclipse, the sharp edge of the moon can be used to greatly increase the angular resolution of the radio telescope in one dimension. This paper describes the technique used to estimate the brightness distribution at 3.3 mm wavelength of the solar limb from measurements made during a total eclipse. The outer edge of the sun is divided into thin concentric bands and parameteric estimation methods are used to estimate the average flux desity of each band. This approach has several advantages for inverting radiometric data, especially in scanning problems."
"The development of a multiturn loop antenna for a police officer's personal radio set is described. The antenna is small, low profile, lightweight, with dimensions of2.7 \\times 2.7 \\times 0.7in high (1.06 \\times 1.06 \\times 0.28cm), and is tunable over the 150- to 170-MHz band. VSWR and radiation patterns are presented with the antenna mounted on a man's shoulder. The shoulder-mounted antenna characteristics are described with conditions where the man is in standing, stooping, and prone positions, with various head and arm movements, and with light and heavy clothing. Radiation patterns are referenced to a 6-in helical whip commonly used by police officers. Radiation patterns also indicate body absorption loss for loop and whip antennas mounted at waist level as compared with shoulder levels. The instantaneous bandwidth is 1.4 MHz for a VSWR\\leq 3:1. A dual-frequency model for use in a two-frequency push-to-talk mode, is also shown to be practical."
"During the summer of 1973 the rain reflectivity environment in three-dimensional space was routinely recorded on digital tape at Wallops Island, Va. A mode of operation consisted of sampling periodically60\\degazimuth intervals over regions in which the rain activities were most intense and widespread. A series of plan-position indicator (PPI) sweeps over these intervals were implemented at a sequence of elevation angles starting from0.5\\degup io an angle above which the reflectivity values were below a designated threshold level. Approximately 500 such raster scans were acquired in which each scan was obtained in less than 4 min and covered a range interval of 10 to 140 km. Using the above data base, reflectivity profiles along representative earth-satellite paths were determined from which attenuation and space diversity statistics were calculated at the frequencies of 13 and 18 GHz. Specifically, the formk = aZ^{b}was used to deduce the total path attenuation, wherekis the attenuation coefficient (dB/km), andZis the reflectivity factor (mm6/m3). The constantsaandbwere calculated using the raindrop distribution for thunderstorm activity as proposed by Joss. Probabilities that the attenuations exceed given fade depths, diversity gain as a function of fade depths, and diversity gain as a function of site separation distances are characterized and compared at the various frequencies. For the space diversity mode, a site spacing of 15 km is shown to give rise to a near optimum condition for the diversity gain. Furthermore, the diversity gain has been demonstrated to be minimally influenced by the transmitter frequency."
"Conventional high-frequency (HF) circular phased arrays, such as the Wullenweber circular array, have a cost factor that increases at a greater-than-square law rate as its radius is increased to produce larger apertures. A new method of forming simultaneous beams in an HF circular array has been proposed in which beams are formed in the space within the array from pickup element energy that has been amplified and reradiated. Such a device is called a circular active reflector antenna (CARA), and its cost increases at a substantially linear rate as its radius is increased to form larger apertures. This paper describes calculations of the distribution of reradiated energy within such an array in order to study the effect of changes in array configuration. A cost analysis is presented to establish the dependence of array cost on array size for both the conventional and CARA types of arrays. In addition, the performance of an experimental CARA array is reported. An experimental CARA array consisting of a120\\degpartially filled sector of 1500 m radius, forming six beams over a2\\degfield of view was constructed at a site in Utah to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept. Measurements made on the experimental array showed that at 14-MHz, it formed beams0.7\\degwide at the 3-dB points, which agrees closely to the calculated value. The sidelobe response also compared closely to the level and angular position calculated for the sidelobes of the partially filled sector array tested. No evidence of instabilities or intermodulation distortion was noted."
"The reflection of electromagnetic waves from a smooth conducting surface at high frequencies is studied in this paper. Both the incident and reflected fields are expanded in asymptotic series of the formE = exp [iks(r)]\\Sigma\\min{m=0}\\max{\\infty}(ik)^{-m}e_{m}(r), wheresis the phase function, and {e_{m}} are amplitude vectors. Explicit formulas based on a ray technique are given for calculating the first two orders of the electric field, magnetic field, and surface current. When the conducting surface is a paraboloid (or a sphere) and the incident field is a plane wave in its axial direction, our solution recovers the exact solution (or the first two orders of the exact asymptotic solution), As a special case, our result is compared with the work of Schensted. It appears that the latter is only partially correct."
"The theoretical study of UHF radio communication in coal mines, with particular reference to the rate of loss of signal strength along a tunnel, and from one tunnel to another around a corner is the concern of this paper. Of prime interest are the nature of the propagation mechanism and the prediction of the radio frequency that propagates with the smallest loss. The theoretical results are compared with published measurements. This work was part of an investigation of new ways to reach and extend two-way communications to the key individuals who are highly mobile within the sections and haulageways of coal mines."
"Distributions of average excess delay and delay spread for Gaussian wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering channels associated with 100 small scale areas at different locations within a2 \\times 2.5-km region of New York City are presented. For delay spread the mean is1.3 \\mus, the standard deviation is0.6 \\mus, the maximum value observed is3\\frac{1}{2}\\mus, and 10 percent of the areas exceeded2\\frac{1}{2} \\mus; for average excess delay the mean is1.1 \\mus, the standard deviation is0.9 \\mus, the maximum is4 \\mus, and 10 percent of the areas exceeded2 \\mus. The region is representative of the heavily built-up areas of many large cities in the United States."
"Antenna optimization theory is usually formulated on the premise that all parameters could be adjusted with unlimited accuracy. Since no practical antenna can be built with absolute precision, only optimization in some probabilistic sense of a random performance index appears to be meaningful. The method also generalizes and gives meaning to the concept of regularization used by others. An approximate solution to the probability distribution of the random performance index is obtained. From this several possible senses of optimization may be defined. Several examples in the synthesis of a two-dimensional secant pattern are studied in detail. In general, it may be impractical to build an array with deterministically optimum currents but also next to impossible to even compute the currents accurately. A detailed numerical analysis is given to show possible sources of errors."
"Recent theoretical and experimental studies of the insulated linear antenna in a relatively dense ambient medium are reviewed briefly. Attention is then directed to a description of the admittance and impedance of air-insulated monopoles as determined by theory and by measurements when two quite different junctions between the antenna and the feeding coaxial line are used. Graphs of the admittances of antennas with three different thicknesses of the insulation and lengths up to a wavelength are shown. No theory of the junction effects or simple corrective network is provided, but it is shown that with proper design of the junction region, the uncorrected (ideal) theoretical admittances are satisfactory approximations of measured values."
"A thin wire parallel to a ground plane is analyzed using moment methods to find the complex natural resonant frequencies and modal current distributions. The resonant frequencies are found as functions of the wire radius and distance above the ground. The complex frequencies appear to be divisible into two classes: 1) those associated with the resonant length of the dipole and 2) those associated with interactions of the dipole and its image. For large dipole radii, the two classes interact and some anomalies, which appear, are investigated. The time domain response to a step-function plane wave is computed using the singularity expansion method and the results compare favorably with the Fourier transform solution."
"A periodic array of apertures in a conducting plane can act as a bandpass filter. With proper design the structure will be transparent at its resonant frequency but will have a transmission coefficient below unity at all other frequencies. These periodic surfaces are useful as radomes and in dual frequency antenna feeds. The resonant frequency of such an array may vary with incidence angle. This variation is undesirable for most applications, and can be greatly reduced by reactively loading the slots with the Babinet equivalent of a short circuited two-wire transmission line. It has been found, however, that singly loaded slot arrays have transmission loss due to cross polarized radiation when scanned in theH-plane (perpendicular polarization). It is shown that this cross polarized radiation may be eliminated by using symmetrical loaded slots, which have the further advantage of transmitting waves of arbitrary polarization. In conjunction with this investigation, the modal matching method, previously applied to arrays of rectangular and circular slots, has been extended to the more complicated loaded slot shapes. Both the single loaded and 4-legged symmetrically loaded slots are treated, and good agreement with measured data is obtained."
"The first order geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) predicts vanishing fields along the surface of a conducting wedge for the incident electric field polarized parallel to the diffracting edge. The slope diffraction coefficient is a valid correction term for incidence angles removed from the shadow boundary. A new slope diffraction function for the half plane is presented along with applications. This new form of slope diffraction coefficient for the half plane is valid through the shadow region. Reciprocity is invoked to find the far-fields for a source on the surface of the conducting wedge. In addition to applying the two-dimensional slope diffraction analysis to practical problems, the equivalent current concepts have been extended to include equivalent slope currents for the analysis of either finite or curved edges. This new form of the slope diffraction function has been successfully used to provide anH-plane horn pattern analysis that is considerably less tedious than previously possible with GTD. Both pure GTD solutions and hybrid solutions using conventional aperture integration for the main beam region and GTD for the far-out side and back lobes are compared with experimental results."
"The well-known logarithmic behavior of the singular \"exact\" kernel of cylindrical antenna integral equations is explicitly separated. The elliptic integral partitioning of the kernel by Schelkunoff is the point of departure in the development. The result is an expression for the kernel comprising the logarithmic term and a well-behaved economically computable residual term. This result is readily amenable to numerical solutions of integral equations of cylindrical geometries. Numerical results obtained from method-of-moments solutions to cylindrical antennas are given to verify the result."
"A new technique for exciting a cylindrical array is described. It uses a Butler matrix and a simple switching matrix for exciting only that sector of the array that contributes to formation of a desired radiation pattern. It accomplishes full circumferential coverage with fewer active components, reduced complexity, and better performance than other matrix methods for exciting cylindrical arrays. An array ofNelements is configured so thatN/M (M = 1, 2, 3, ...)contiguous elements spanning an active angular sector of2\\pi/Mare excited simultaneously to form a radiation pattern. This paper considers the caseM = 4in which a quadrant array is excited by anN/4-way power divider and anN/4 \\times N/4Buffer matrix. Pattern selection or rotation is accomplished byN/4phasers andN/41P4T switches. Continuous full circle rotation of the radiation pattern requiresNswitching operations in addition to linear control of the phasers."
"The design characteristics of a circularly polarized linear array are presented. The array elements are crossed slot radiators on the narrow wall of a T-septated waveguide that supports Odd and even symmetry modes. These modes have the same phase velocities, if the dual mode waveguide is properly dimensioned, and they excite independently the shunt and series portions of the crossed slot element. Based on theoretical and empirical design criteria, a linear array of such elements was constructed and tested and the results proved very satisfactory."
"Ground-based monopoles are not suitable standard-gain antennas because their power gain, at low elevation angles especially, is much less than that for the same monopole fed against infinite perfectly conducting ground, and the power gain achieved may vary as much as 3 dB or more as the moisture content of the ground changes. Low-angle approximations are given to show the effect of reflection coefficient on power gain for a quarter-wave monopole fed against a ground plane on imperfect ground and a horizontal half-wave dipole above imperfect ground. Low-angle dipole power gain variations are several tenths of a dB; monopole variations are several dB for ground constants varying from\\epsilon_{r} = 4, \\sigma =0.02mho/m to\\epsilon_{r} = 10, \\sigma = 0.06mho/m. Monopole power gain data are grouped according to test range moisture conditions at the time of measurement, and a statistical analysis of the resulting data is briefly discussed."
"The theory of propagation through a precipitation medium is based here on the differential propagation constant and two additional complex constants. The latter reduce to a single real parameter, the \"canting angle,\" for certain simple models, for example, for a population of equioriented symmetrical scatterers. In a uniform medium the constants are closely related to the elements of an equivalent permittivity tensor. It is shown that the parameters can be determined from a sequence of depolarization measurements."
"Ground mapping radars such as those encountered in airport surface traffic control use circular polarization to reduce the effects of rain clutter. The effectiveness of circular polarization is reduced significantly by ground reflections. Calculations are presented for representative cases."
"Two shortcomings of the use of collocation method of moments procedures to solve Pocklington-type integral equations for thin-wire structures are discussed. One of the shortcomings, innate in the collocation procedure, is that match-points cannot be spaced sufficiently densely in the feed region of a wire antenna to accurately sample the highly local driving field when the feed diameter is very small The other shortcoming occurs when the current, expressed as a linear combination of the elements of the basis set, exhibits slope discontinuities. The behavior of the scattered field computed from such currents is discussed in terms of its influence on solution convergence. The results of numerical experiments embodying these two phenomena are presented."
"Accurate numerical calculation of the surface current density on a perfectly conducting elliptic cylinder irradiated by an electrically or magnetically polarized plane wave is presented. The only existing comprehensive published results are significantly in error."
"20-GHz band propagation tests have been made in the Musashino district. We report the statistical analysis of differential rain attenuation on two adjacent links in summer 1971 and its application to millimeter wave system design."
"An impulsive plane wave (TE mode) is incident on a cold uniform plasma half space. The known Laplace transform of the reflected wave is expanded in such a fashion that an inversion of the terms allows one to obtain the impulse response as an infinite series of modified Bessel functions of the first kind. For the special case of small losses it is shown this response simplifies to a previous result."
"Two identical coplanar rectangular loops have been analyzed. For various shapes of the loops, as well as various spacings between loops, circuit properties have been investigated. The center-line-driven loop antenna has also been investigated as two coplanar loops with infinitesimal spacing. It is shown that the centerline-driven loop antenna may be characterized by a relatively high impedance property, and if the shape of the loop is appropriate, its impedance can have a broadband property."
"Measurements of rainfall attenuation of millimeter waves at\\lambda = 5.77, 3.3, and 2 mm were conducted during the years 1969-1070. Simultaneously recorded meteorological quantities were the rainfall rate and a part of the drop-size spectrum. Attenuation coefficients as a function of rainfall rate were thus determined. These attenuation coefficients were related to parameters that, under certain assumptions, describe the drop-size distribution in rain."
 "Three one-element short backfire (SBF) antennas at 40 MHz, 140 MHz, and 350 MHz were built in the institute for the use with the ATS-6 radio beacon experiment (RBE). Ehrenspeck's data experimentally measured in the GHz range were transformed into the VHF range. Since there were no relevant data available concerning the dipoles and feeder systems, various types were tested in combination with differently shaped SBF reflectors. The antennas were optimized with respect to gain, sidelobe suppression (ss), and forward-backward ratio (fbr). For all antennas ss was better than 20 dB and fbr better than 30 dB. The data, measured with the two identical antenna methods, are presented and compared with Ehrenspeck's data obtained with the pattern integration method. Ehrenspeck's gain seems to be about 0.8 dB higher than that measured at the antenna test range at Lindau, very likely due to the different measuring methods. In all other aspects the agreement of the data seems to be fairly good. The ATS-6 RBE yields the opportunity to measure the differential group delay of the RF signals. For this purpose the relative dispersion-phase shift\\Delta_{D}-between the 40-MHz, 140-MHz, and 360-MHz carriers and their\\pm1-MHz sidebands has to be known fairly accurately. The following data were obtained:|\\Delta_{D40/41}| \\leq 4\\deg/MHz;|\\Delta_{140/141}| \\leq 1.03\\deg/MHz;|\\Delta_{D360/361}| \\leq 0.4\\deg/MHz. Furthermore the total delay with respect to vacuum of the 360-MHz, 140-MHz, and 40-MHz SBF antennas was coarsely measured by using the two identical antennas method. We got the following figures52.5 \\times 10^{-9}s at 40 MHz,15 \\times 10^{-9}s at 140 MHz, and5.8 \\times 10^{-9}s at 360 MHz. These data are practically independent from azimuth and elevation angles of the antennas and from the conductivity of the ground as long as the elevation angle is larger than15\\deg. Similar measurements with Yagi antennas showed a strong variation of the aforementioned parameters when installing them at different locations. Thus the SBF antennas seem to be the best possible compromise of any antenna type for the specific purpose of the differential group delay measurements."
"Presents the back cover of the periodical issue."
"Observed electromagnetic wave depolarization in forward propagation due to precipitation tends to distribute statistically about some mean level of depolarization. This is due to random rain parameters that cause this depolarization. Using a drop-size modified depolarization model, we have analyzed the statistical scatter of the cross polarization ratio due to random distributions of drop population and size and found a standard deviation of approximately 2.5 dB about the mean, independent of frequency."
"The directivity characteristics of a uniformly excitedN \\times Narray of high- or low-gain elements are described. The voltage patterns of the individual elements were assumed to be of the formcos^{m} \\thetaandJ_{1}(K\\theta)/K\\theta, wheremandKare parameters used to vary the element pattern beamwidths. Directivity curves are presented as a function of the element spacing in wavelengths withNas a parameter (N = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12) for the Bessel element pattern. The array directivity characteristics using the cosine element pattern are not greatly different from those computed using the Bessel element pattern. Comparisons between the computed and measured directivities of two array configurations show good agreement."
"Determinations of the total atmospheric absorption at 22.2 GHz have been obtained from measurements of atmospheric emission. The results indicate a large range of variation in total absorption seasonally, daily, and hourly. The measurement uncertainties are much smaller than any of these observed variations. The absorption does not show a sufficiently precise correlation with the surface dew point temperature to enable the prediction of the absorption to be made from the dew point temperature."
"This communication continues the investigation of Lewis' inverse scattering method started in [1]. The purpose here is first to show that the previously mentioned results can be significantly improved and then to point out the requirements for an experimental setup."
"In a previous communication the authors have shown that in applying the method of moments to problems in electromagnetics the matrix condition numbers can be used to indicate regions in Which instability occurs. However, the calculation of the condition numbers requires an explicit matrix inverse which is costly. The pivot ratio, which is easily calculated from information known within the Gaussian elimination scheme, indicates instabilities as well as the condition number but without requiring an explicit inverse. A number of examples illustrating the use of the pivot ratio are presented."
"The WIRES computer program as reported in [2] has seen wide use in the analysis of wire antennas. However, errors exist in the program's treatment of a wire (or wires) incorporating radius changes. Simple corrections are presented to eliminate these errors."
"New results for the covariance of the intensity fluctuations of a plane wave propagating in a strongly turbulent medium are presented, and the consequences of these new results on aperture averaging, angle of arrival fluctuations, and the temporal frequency spectrum of the intensity scintillations are evaluated. The differences between the strong turbulence and weak turbulence cases are generally quite significant."
"The log-periodic V-dipole antenna (LPVA) operating in the3\\lambda/2mode is analyzed numerically using the projective technique. The antenna is treated as a parallel connection of an array of V-dipoles and a feeder transmission line. This decoupling of the circuits enables one to obtain the dipole currents simply by considering the array of V-dipoles as a boundary value problem and solving the necessary integral equations. The currents can then be used to give the various properties of the antenna. Effects on the antenna behavior obtained by changing its parameters are illustrated, and general characteristic curves presented."
"The design method of and experimental results obtained from a wide-band satellite antenna with a multifrequency primary horn is described. This antenna can be used in 4, 6, 20, and 30 GHz frequency bands. Some measured data of the primary horn and the antenna are reported. Consequently, the antenna efficiency is about 45-50 percent in all the above frequency bands."
"Accuracy considerations in the measurement of the power gain of a large microwave antenna are discussed. The analysis indicates that, using the power gain comparison method with a standard antenna of nominally 40-dB gain, a large antenna with a power gain of nominally 60 dB could be calibrated to within an error of 0.17 dB (3\\sigma). The power gain of the standard antenna is considered to be determined via the generalized three-antenna extrapolation method. Individual sources of errors in both the generalized three-antenna extrapolation method and the power gain comparison method are discussed."
"The geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) (cf. [1], for example) may be applied advantageously to many axially symmetric reflector antenna geometries. The material in this communication presents analytical, computational, and experimental results for commonly encountered reflector geometries, both to illustrate the general principles and to present a compact summary of generally applicable formulas."
"A linear wideband array with each element followed by a tapped-delay line may be considered as a two-dimensional distal filter. Accordingly, the radiation pattern of the processor may be expressed as the product of a pair of two-dimensional discrete Fourier transforms (DFT's)."
"The power of the reciprocity theorem, in being able to generate solutions of a wide class of layered media problems from a single known formulation, is pointed out. Specifically, we start with the solution for the mutual coupling between two Hertzian electric dipoles that are located in the resistive waveguide channel in the earth's crust. We then obtain useful modifications of these results to allow for other locations and orientations of the dipoles including the extensions to magnetic dipoles."
"An approach to treating the thin-wire junction geometry, which arises in the computer modeling of a great many electromagnetic radiation and scattering problems, is presented. The method is based upon a finite-difference type interpretation of the differential operator in the Pocklington form of the integro-differential equation representing the junction problem. An important advantage of the method is that it is capable of producing accurate results even with relatively simple basis and testing functions, e.g., pulse and\\delta-functions. Furthermore, the method does not require the imposition of additional constraints, such as the Kirchhoff current law or the conservation of charge, at the junction points. The method is versatile in that it applies to L-shaped structures as well as to junctions of thin wires of dissimilar radii. Numerical results based on the present finite difference approach have been computed and good agreement with results derived by other independent methods has been observed. An important conclusion of this work is that the conventional interpretation of the differential operator leads to erroneous results since the sampling interval in the conventional finite difference scheme is different from the correct value of the sampling interval found in this paper."
"The reflection and transmission of rectangular and Gaussian pulses impinging on a periodically stratified slab are studied and a number of examples are illustrated and analyzed. The coupled waves approach is used to derive the reflection and transmission coefficient, then the fast Fourier transform is used to illustrate the transient responses."
"A new method for detection and discrimination of radar targets is described. The basis for this method is that the gross structure of a radar target can be identified from scattered fields of the target at harmonic radar frequencies located just in the low resonance region. This is in sharp contrast to many target signature schemes that operate at much higher frequencies and observe many of the details of the target in lieu of its gross features. Multiple frequency radar scattering data and the complex natural resonant frequencies of radar targets are integrated into a predictor-correlator processor. The method is illustrated using as target models both classical shapes and thin-wire configurations of simple geometry. Integral equation programs are utilized to calculate multiple frequency backscatter data for the wire geometries and to deduce the complex natural resonant frequencies of the wire structures. Discrete multiple frequency radar scattering data spanning a particular spectral range are shown to be desirable for optimum capability but discrimination and detection can be achieved using just two near-conventional radars, even if the radars are located at different sites and hence view the target from different aspects."
"A direct method for calculating the impulse response of a slit in a conducting screen is presented. The method may be used to study the scattering of electromagnetic pulses by conducting objects with planar boundaries and straight edges. The impulse response is obtained by assuming that the total response is composed of two sequences of diffracted waves. The solution is determined for the first two diffracted waves in one sequence by using Green's functions and the equivalence principle. The method is applied iteratively to obtain the solution for additional waves in the sequence. The solution for the other sequence is obtained by a transformation of coordinates. The total response is the sum of the two sequences of waves. The cases ofE-polarization andH-polarization are considered. Curves are presented to depict 1) the successive diffractions of the pulses by the edges of the slit, and 2) the impulse response of the slit."
"A piecewise-sinusoidal reaction technique is developed for scattering and radiation from perfectly conducting bodies of arbitrary shape. This paper presents the theory and numerical results for scattering patterns of rectangular plates and radiation patterns of corner-reflector antennas. In all cases, experimental measurements are included for comparison with the calculated data."
"The steady-state results for thick hemispherically capped monopoles with or without conical feed sections are used to construct the transient response of such monopoles. For a voltage pulse excitation, file transient waveforms for the transmitted-reflected feed currents, the radiated fields in different directions, and the instantaneous currents on the monopoles are calculated and presented. Steady-state results are obtained by solving the scalar potential integral equation with the axis extended boundary condition using the moment method."
"Previous analyses of the input impedance of a thin biconical antenna are extended to include the effect of the air-ground interface. It is supposed that the antenna could be vertically located in the air or embedded in a spherical insulating cavity. The description of the basic theory is given and the electrical characteristics of the antenna such as the input impedance and the current distribution are determined, Illustrative calculations show that the air-ground interface changes the value of the input impedance but, as in the case of cylindrical antennas, the current dissymmetry only occurs if the antenna is situated very near the interface. Therefore, the shapes of the radiation patterns are nearly the same as those obtained by assuming a sinusoidal current repartition."
"The mutual impedance of nonplanar-skew sinusoidal dipoles is presented rigorously as a summation of several exponential integrals with complex arguments."
"It is shown that shaped-conical radiation patterns can be realized by extending the resonant fractional-turn quadrifilar helix to an integral number of turns, i.e., the radiated energy can be concentrated into a cone with the gain decreasing from a maximum at the edge of the cone to a local minimum at the center. This pattern shape is near optimum for many spacecraft communications and navigation applications, providing approximately 3 dB improvement over cardioid shaped patterns."
"That spherical harmonic functionsY_{nm}(\\theta,\\phi)can be used to advantage in the Earth-rotation synthesis of radio astronomy maps is shown in this paper. As Earth rotates the baseline of a radio interferometer generates a cone whose angle\\theta, measured from theN-Spolar axis, can be varied by changing the baseline's azimuthal direction on the surface of Earth. A series of Earth-rotation measurements, at different cone angles but with baselines of equal lengthb, can be regarded as being made on a baseline sphere of radiusb, the analog of theuvplane in Fourier-type synthesis. The measured output distribution can be expanded as a spherical harmonic series on the baseline sphere. The coefficients of the series are related to the coefficients of the spherical harmonic series expansion of the source distribution on the celestial sphere by a matrix transformation. The matrix [B] is a function only of the baseline configuration (it does not vary with source declination). Inversion of the matrix leads to the solution for the source coefficients, from which a spherical harmonic map is formed of the source distribution."
"A conical circularly polarized dual-mode horn, designed for the frequency range of 1400-1460 MHz, is described. This electrically shorter version of the Potter horn yields circularly symmetrical patterns over a broader frequency range (approaching 10 percent). A technique is described for matching the input over the design bandwidth with a VSWR < 1.05."
"Two focal plane parabolic reflectors 2.8 m in diameter were used to test the feasibility of compensating for reflector surface profile errors by figuring the surface of a Cassegrain mirror. The paraboloids had been designed originally for frequencies less than 7 GHz, and therefore the surface errors had a significant effect on the antenna performance in the 27-40 GHz range. For these frequencies a template could be used to measure the surface profile. The first reflector had a prominent axially symmetrical surface error component. Compensating for this alone simplified the construction of the subreflector and improved the overall aperture efficiency at 34 GHz from 12 percent to 24 percent. The second reflector had a more random distribution of surface errors. Its efficiency was improved from 35 percent to 48 percent at 34 GHz, the improvement in gain varying from 1.1 dB at 28 GHz to 2.3 dB at 40 GHz, the shortfall being within 1 dB of the possible improvement predicted from the measured surface errors. For both reflectors the illumination efficiency set by the feed horn was about 50 percent. The linear cross polarization discrimination on axis increased from 29 dB to 38 dB at 34 GHz. The sidelobe levels and gain improvement obtained suggest that effective rms errors of about 0.45 mm with correlation distances of about 30 cm remained on the reflector surface after compensation, consistent with the estimated accuracy of the measuring and construction techniques adopted."
"Two simple mathematical models are described for the prediction of the vector radiation fields from offset parabolic reflector antennas with offset feeds. Experimental support for the predictions obtained from the models has been obtained by comparisons with measured data from antenna systems operating at 30 GHz. The principal radiation characteristics of the offset-reflector with offset-feed configuration are discussed."
"Numerical solutions for the radiation patterns of aircraft antennas provide an excellent means of designing and locating antennas in order to achieve the desired performance. The high frequency solutions presented in this paper are based on fuselage antennas mounted on a general-type aircraft but applied specifically to the KC-135 aircraft. The roll and elevation plane patterns are computed for a monopole, axial slot, and circumferential slot mounted both over and forward of the wings. In each case the calculated patterns compare very favorably with the measured patterns. The precision pattern measurements were taken on a\\frac{1}{25}scale model of the KC-135 aircraft at NASA (Hampton, Va.) with special emphasis on reducing the mount and background effects."
"Except for the most trivial cases, antenna radiation problems involving inhomogeneous media escape analytical solution. For these problems, it is necessary to seek computer solutions. To this end, we have investigated Mei's [1] \"unimoment\" technique as it applies to a biconical antenna immersed in an inhomogeneons medium. The technique is used in conjunction with finite difference methods to analyze some dielectric loading schemes with the goal of improving performance of the biconical antenna. The technique is shown to be sufficiently general to allow analysis of any rotationally symmetric antenna inside an inhomogeneous medium by using more flexible finite element methods. Results of experimental investigations bear out the validity of the technique."
"The near-field compact range uses the quasi-plane-wave beam produced by a large dish antenna, thereby greatly reducing the normal2 D^{2}/\\lambdaseparation required. This type of range has been experimentally evaluated for both antennas and scatterers; there is partial filling of sidelobe nulls and pattern distortion below some pattern level. No data were found on the use of compact ranges for tracker antenna measurement. This paper analyzes tracker measurement performance. In the near-field, the transverse field has oscillations in both amplitude and phase, and an asymmetric amplitude taper. Geometric diffraction is used to calculate the near-field; this is the only near-field method that is moderately simple. Details of this method are given, along with typical field plots. For the tracker antenna, a simple difference pattern analogous to sinx/xis used, with the perturbed pattern obtained from a numerical integration of the aperture distribution modified by the field perturbations. A versatile computer code was written and many test cases were run to determine the effect of varying the several parameters. The difference pattern null depth needed for faithful measurement is derived as a function of tracker accuracy, and it is shown that null depth is primarily controlled by field amplitude taper. Effects of varying the ratio of range to test antenna diameter, range antennaf/D, and test area transverse and axial location are described. The effects of an inclined feed, which reduces amplitude asymmetry, are calculated. A clearer understanding of the role of edge diffracted rays is obtained from the calculations; these rays affect primarily pattern shape and sidelobe nulls. The technique allows an effective tradeoff of all parameters to be easily, quickly, and relatively inexpensively made."
"The theory and numerical results for an axial slot antenna on a circular cylinder are presented. The slot and the cylinder have infinite length."
"The design of optimal antenna patterns subject to sidelobe constraints is considered. A function space formulation of the antenna pattern shaping problem yields several advantages over currently available techniques for computing optimal line-source excitations. The two basic problems studied are a) maximizing directivity subject to hard, possibly angle-dependent, constraints on the sidelobe level and beamwidth; and b) antenna pattern shaping where the approximating pattern must fit into a known envelope."
"For the problem of scattering by infinite conducting cylinders, erroneous results are obtained at certain frequencies. This paper discusses the nature of these resonant solutions, indicates how the matrix condition numbers can be used to detect these situations, and evaluates several methods used to obtain correct results at resonances."

"An approximate equivalence between an impedance loaded surface and a thin dielectric shell is given. This approximation is used to compute the backscattering from a thin circular dielectric tube and the results are compared to the exact solution. Computations for backscattering from a thin dielectric cone-sphere and resonant wire loop inside of a thin dielectric cylinder are also given as further illustrations of the method."
"The equivalence theorem is used to derive novel generalized boundary condition (GBC) integral equations for the tangential components of the electric and magnetic fields on the interfaces of a finite number of dielectric or conducting scatterers. Closed surface, plane, and line extended boundary conditions (EBC) equivalent to the GBC are introduced. The GBC integral equations can now be replaced by any of these EBC integral equations whose solutions are unique and easy to obtain numerically using the moment method. A perfectly conducting sphere and a dielectric sphere in the electrostatic field of two equal and opposite point charges are presented as simple examples of the general procedure."
"Simultaneous matrix equations are obtained for solving the problem of scattering by many different homogeneous ferrite cylinders located in front of a90\\degcorner reflector. The equations are based on the extended integral equations derived from the reciprocity theorem in the cylinders and on the method of images. After the problem of plane-wave scattering is treated, various radiation patterns for the corner reflector antenna with some circular ferrite cylinders are exhibited. From the latter numerical results the possibilities of one-lobe or two-lobe switching and lobe extinction by varying the dc magnetic fields applied to the cylinders become clear."
"A unified method for the optimization of receiving arrays is presented. The optimization is performed by a linear transformation (coordinate transformation) method. Arrays of lossless arbitrarily arranged in space, but uniformly oriented, elements are analyzed."
"Frequency-scanning characteristics of an artificial dielectric leaky-wave antenna are discussed. It is experimentally observed that the beam angle changes from10\\degto50\\degoff broadside when the frequency is changed from 8.13 to 9.05 GHz. Over this frequency range the beamwidth does not vary monotonically and changes from7.5\\degto6.0\\degto7.1\\deg. It is found that the artificial dielectric antenna has a better temperature stability than that for frequency scanned arrays."
"This is a brief review paper on the interaction of radio waves with oxygen and water vapor in the atmosphere. It is the first of a series of mini-reviews sponsored by the Wave Propagation Standards Committee of IEEE and is intended primarily for those persons who have not had occasion to study extensively in the subject."
"The standard far-field approximation to the Kirchhoff formula for the field scattered by a flat metallic plateSof arbitrary shape is given by a certain surface (double) integral. This double integral can be reduced to a line integral evaluated around the boundary of S. Moreover, ifSis a polygon, this line integral can be reduced to a closed form expression involving no integrations at all. The use of such line integral representations can easily reduce the costs of numerical calculation by orders of magnitude. If the integrands are to be sampledptimes per wavelength to achieve an acceptable degree of precision, and ifAis the area ofS, then the numerical evaluation of the double integral requiresp^{2}A/\\lambda^{2}functional evaluations whereas the line integral only requiresp\\sqrt{A/\\lambda^{2}}. IfSis a polygon withNvertices, then only2Nfunctional evaluations are required to evaluate the closed form expression with no quadrature error at all."
"An optical method for broadbanding a phased array is considered. A narrow band feed-through aperture lens comprised of pick-up elements, radiating elements, and360\\degtype phase shifters is fed by a small feed array with an intervening passive lens. The lens has fixed frequency-sensitive properties. The feed array has variable time delay compensators which are selected in accordance with the desired scan angle in the far field. Using geometrical optics, design formulas are derived that relate bandwidth and scan angle to the minimum number of variable time delayers. To demonstrate performance, diffraction theory is used to calculate patterns, sidelobe levels, and efficiencies as a function of bandwidth and scan angle out to50\\degscan for several aperture sizes. In the worst cases, the optical system provides somewhat less gain than the comparable constrained subarray antenna; however, it always provides much better sidelobe levels."
"Taylor's earlier work on circular apertures is enlarged to include a class of radiation patterns consisting of a narrow central beam and asymmetric sidelobes. A synthesis technique applicable to such problems, and using Taylor patterns as building blocks, is formulated. One special case is treated in detail: a sidelobe topography which is 25 dB down in the\\phi = 0half-plane, smoothly rising to 15 dB down in the\\phi= \\pi/2half-plane, remaining at that level until the\\phi = 3\\pi/2half-plane is reached, and then smoothly subsiding to 25 dB again as\\phiincreases from3\\pi/2to2\\pi. The complex aperture distribution is derived generally, and exhibited specifically for this case."
"Several numerical schemes for solving Pocklington's and Hallén's equations for thin-wire scatterers are investigated. Convergence rates of solutions obtained from seven methods are given and reasons for different rates are delineated."
"The determination of surface currents induced by a magnetic line source on a perfectly conducting concave cylindrical surface is dealt with in this paper. A \"perfect\" planar absorber is postulated along the cylinder diameter. The condition that the field be bounded at the origin requires the spectral representation of the characteristic Green's function to possess, in addition to a discrete spectrum comprising a finite number of whispering gallery (WG) modes, also a continuous spectrum. In the asymptotic high frequency limit the latter yields an \"intrinsic\" diffraction effect that together with the WG mode series correctly reproduces the singularity of the source. The connection between ray optics and the modal series is established by means of a representation comprising modes and rays. This composite representation provides insight into possible generalizations of the results to arbitrary concave cylinders with slowly varying radii of curvature. For circular cylinders with largeka, numerical results are presented for the magnitude of the surface magnetic field distribution."
"The mechanism of spot dancing is clarified by the application of wave theory in a random medium. The solution is based on the moment equation which prescribes the statistical properties of waves scattered successively in the forward direction. Spot dancing is described by the use of wave function; the relation between the spot dancing and the random medium becomes clear. Spot dancing is a limited phenomenon in wave motions. The distribution of arrival position is normal along the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, and the variance is uniquely determined by the correlation function of the medium and the propagation length of the wave. In addition, the Rice-Nakagami distribution of irradiance can be physically interpreted as the log-irradiance distribution in the spot dancing of a Gaussian wave beam."
"Field distributions in a flanged parallel-plate waveguide have been computed using the Weber-Schafheitlin integral technique. Equiamplitude and equiphase contours are presented in graphical forms for a specific choice of parameters."
"The angular distribution of the phase of the fields of an electric dipole with and without a sheath in a hot magnetoplasma is calculated. Like the amplitude distribution of the field, the phase distribution can also be used for estimating the electron temperature."
"It is demonstrated theoretically that mutual coupling effects on the radiation pattern of an element in the presence of another one can be reduced with appropriate loads. Constant coupling circles are calculated and plotted on a Smith chart. The choice of transistors for active antenna design then becomes clearer either for reception or for emission."
"Two methods for measuring antenna efficiency are described. The two methods, referred to as the Wheeler method and theQmethod, are used to find the efficiency of electrically small multiturn loop antennas. The principal advantage of both methods is that they can be quickly and easily applied. Further, both methods relate the antenna efficiency to the input impedance rather than a far-field pattern integration. Thus, the methods are applicable at VHF and frequencies below where the design of an antenna range or anechoic chamber becomes increasingly difficult and expensive."
"A small antenna is one whose size is a small fraction of the wavelength. It is a capacitor or inductor, and it is tuned to resonance by a reactor of opposite kind. Its bandwidth of impedance matching is subject to a fundamental limitation measured by its \"radiation power factor\" which is proportional to its \"effective volume\". These principles are reviewed in the light of a quarter-century of experience. They are related to various practical configurations, including flush radiators for mounting on aircraft. Among the examples, one extreme is a small one-turn loop of wide strip, tuned by an integral capacitor. The opposite extreme is the largest antenna in the world, which is a \"small antenna\" in terms of its operating wavelength. In each of these extremes, the radiation power factor is much less than one percent."
"A boundary value treatment is used to derive field expressions for a dielectric coated coaxial cable with a gap in the shield. Specific results are given for an incident TEM mode in the interior coaxial region. For example, it is shown that, for the VHF region, as much as 18 percent of the incident power is radiated into the external region via a single circumferential gap in the shield. Comparable amounts of power are transferred to a reflected TEM mode in the cable and into surface waves in the dielectric jacket."
"A technique is presented in which the moment method (MM) is combined with the geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD). Since diffraction solutions exist for only relatively few structures, it is very desirable to have a means of obtaining the diffracted field for additional structures. Solutions for many structures can be obtained from this combination of techniques, and thus one is able to handle a wide variety of new problems which could not have been solved previously. The approach is developed and applied to a variety of structures in order to illustrate the approach and its validity."
"The singularity expansion method (SEM) has been applied to determine the current and charge induced on a system of perpendicular crossed cylinders. The SEM characteristics of this structure have been studied as the various parameters are varied. The time domain response of one particular geometry has been obtained by SEM and compared to that determined by the more conventional frequency domain analysis and Fourier inversion."
"The problem of absorption of microwaves by molecular oxygen in the atmosphere is treated by means of a first-order approximation to the impact theory of overlapping spectral lines. By including only the coupling between adjacent rotational states in molecular collisions, we have devised a simple approximate method for computing the interference between lines from measurements on the resolved lines. The need for an empirically determined function describing the linewidth/ pressure ratio is eliminated. Comparisons with measurements at atmospheric pressures show that the first-order interference accounts for the low absorption at the band wings near 1 atm pressure. It also predicts the correct amount of asymmetry between high and low frequency wings. Improvement over previous models for the pressure broadening is obtained at frequencies\\gsim 55GHz. This approach is not specific to oxygen and could be adapted to other similar molecules."
"It is sometimes assumed that, in order to obtain good low-angle radio transmission and reception at HF, one must use vertical polarization and have an extensive horizontal highly conducting foreground, such as an ocean surface or an enormous ground screen. It is shown that, in the absence of such a surface, use may be made of inland sites having a sloping foreground combined with distant level terrain. The latter can be a fresh water surface. The angle of slope of inland sites should be about four times the minimum angle of elevation for which coverage is required. Coverage down to1\\degtherefore requires a slope of about 1 in 14. At a wavelength of 15 m, an antenna with a phase center about 30 m above the local terrain must be erected about 1.5 km up the slope from the location where the terrain becomes level. The sloping and level terrains must be fiat to an accuracy of better than about 20 m, and the level terrain, or fresh-water surface, must extend to a distance of about 15 km. All linear dimensions scale proportionally to the wavelength."
"The combination of a linear antenna and slot antenna can be used to provide a relatively isotropic radiation pattern when the dipole is perpendicular to the plane of the slot. The theoretical far-field radiation pattern of a dipole flanked by a two-element array of slot antennas is formulated. The fields for two different phasings between the elements of the combination antenna are calculated and the degree of approximation to an isotropic source in the sense of the total field noted. An experimental antenna was fabricated and the radiated fields measured with good agreement found with the theoretical formulas."
"Techniques for measuring the admittance and distributions of current and charge along rotationally symmetrically insulated monopoles in a relatively dense ambient medium have been extended to include eccentrically insulated monopoles. Measured data on the admittance, current, and charge distributions of such monopoles in fresh water are reported and compared with the recently developed theory of Wu, Shen, and King [1]."
"The shortcomings of both the surface integration and the two-aperture approach to the prediction of dielectric rod antenna patterns are well known. An alternative procedure based on a simplified scattering model is presented which is capable of yielding satisfactory results without the necessity of making empirical corrections."
"An experimentalK_{a}-band (37 GHz) lens antenna designed to have -40 dB sidelobes or lower outside a cone of minimum practical size is described. The results are compared to that optimum Taylor pattern which, for fixed aperture size, maximizes the directivity on boresight subject to the above sidelobe constraint. The effect of a thick homogeneous spherical radome on the sidelobes, as well as a more conventional dish antenna, was also measured."
"The experimental values for the attenuation and phase constant of a two-wire transmission line lying on a concrete roadway are used in conjunction with a model for the transmission line-roadway interface to deduce values of the effective dielectric constant and loss tangent for the roadway material. These are obtained for both dry and wet roadways over a range of frequencies."
"Some general numerical methods for antenna pattern synthesis, with and without constraints, are developed. Particular cases considered are 1) field pattern specified in amplitude and phase, 2) field pattern specified in amplitude only, and 3) these two cases with a constraint on the source norm. Both the source and the field are discretized at the beginning, and the methods of finite dimensional vector spaces are used for the computations. The theory is general, but is applied only to point sources arbitrarily distributed in a plane, and to pattern synthesis in this plane. Some numerical examples are given for ten sources approximately equispaced on one-half of an ellipse, with the desired field pattern chosen to be the csc\\phipattern in the first quadrant."

"A technique is described for synthesizing the coefficients of an antenna array which satisfy a constrained minimax criterion. Inhibition regions can be formed in the beam pattern and placed advantageously in directions associated with strong sources of interference. Modified Dolph-Chebyshev beam patterns are obtained by imposing upper and lower constraining bounds on the beam pattern over regions of directions in space. Specific examples are presented for line arrays."
"This is a brief review paper on rain caused attenuation. The paper is a mini-review sponsored by the Wave Propagation Standards Committee of the IEEE. The paper reviews progress on the development and verification of a theory of rain caused attenuation. The paper also considers the statistical models required to predict attenuation."
"The results of an experimental and theoretical study of the effects of placing a dielectric sphere over the aperture of a circular waveguide are presented. A dielectric sphere excited by a Huygens' source is used us the theoretical model to interpret the experimental results. Calculations based on this model show good overall agreement with experimental patterns and directivity measurements. It is concluded that dielectric loaded antennas such as the dielectric sphere excited by a waveguide can produce directivities in excess of that obtained by a uniformly illuminated aperture of the same cross section, particularly for dielectric objects with dimensions of two wavelengths or less. Measurements of the coupling between these antennas show that they, in general, are not as closely coupled as plain apertures without dielectric object loading."
"Measured distributions of current and charge per unit length on electrically long and thin crossed antennas over a ground plane are displayed for five sets of lengths that locate the junction at minima and maxima of charge and include resonant and antiresonant combinations of lengths. The currents are induced by a normally incident plane electromagnetic wave with its electric vector parallel to one of the mutually perpendicular antennas. Attention is given to the behavior of currents and charges near the junction where Kirchhoff's current law and equality of charges per unit length are observed. For purposes of physical understanding a zero-order explanation of the distributions of charge per unit length and current is given in terms of resonant and forced components."
"The results of experimental studies on the backscattering properties of corn, milo, soybeans, and alfalfa are presented. The measurements were made during the summer of 1973 over the 8-18 GHz frequency band. The data indicate that soil moisture estimation is best accomplished at incidence angles near nadir with lower frequencies while crop discrimination is best accomplished using two frequencies at incidence angles ranging from30\\degto65\\deg. It is also shown that temporal plant morphology variations can cause extreme variations in the values of the scattering coefficients. These morphological changes can be caused by growth, heavy rain, and in the case of alfalfa, harvesting."
"An experiment has been designed to study the effects of rain on transmission through large radomes of the type which may be used with ground station antennas in satellite links. Measured transmission data from the experiment are described and compared with predicted values. The nonwetting nature of the radome surface significantly degraded with time, and this was accompanied by a large increase in the 20-GHz transmission loss during periods of rain. The losses were in the range of 6-8 dB for rain rates of 3-40 mm/h. The cumulative distribution of transmission through the radome for a 12-month period is presented."
"The problem of minimizing the signals received from interfering or undesirable signal sources by appropriately modifying the antenna radiation pattern is addressed. The solution is presented in terms of the modal expansions of the monochromatic electromagnetic fields outside the radiating structure, and appropriate optimization of these radiation patterns. Physical realizability of the results is assured by requiring that the allowable fields are derived from nonsuper gain antenna excitations; hence the results represent an upper bound on the performance. We consider two complementary, one-dimensional antenna structures, i.e., a circumferentially symmetric line source of lengtha, and an axially independent cylindrical antenna of radius\\rho_{0}. We consider first the case ofNdiscrete interfering signals and compute the loss in antenna directivity when the radiation pattern is modified so as to place a null at each angular position of the interfering signal sources. The results indicate that if all interfering signals are located outside the main beam, the loss in directivity is negligible. When one or more undesired signal sources are in the main beam, the antenna directivity will be reduced appreciably. It is shown that when uniformly distributed noise is superimposed over the discretely located interfering signals, the same antenna pattern maximizes the signal/noise ratio for those practical cases when the interfering signal power is significantly greater than the uniformly distributed noise source power. It is further shown that introducing noise uniformly distributed over all space is equivalent to adding thermal noise at the antenna terminals, as would occur with the receiver. Finally, the effects of bandwidth on the system performance are considered."
 "An analytical and numerical study of the transient current density induced on a perfectly conducting circular cylinder has been carried out. Both TE and TM incident plane waves with impulsive time dependence are considered. Complete closed form expressions for the TE and TM current density at all points on the cylinder and for all time values are obtained by a functional interpolation of both large and small time asymptotic solutions. The complete expressions should he useful in future transient radar scattering problems for approximating the transient current behavior on portions of a complex scatterer. The numerical results are presented in the form of \"snapshots\" of the current density at specific instants of time. The results are interpreted in terms of specular reflection and creeping waves. The creeping wave pulses are seen to be a continuation of pulses generated on the illuminated surface; their propagation into the shadow region is a highly dispersive phenomenon. The natural mode spectrum is seen to have both discrete and continuous components with the response at very large times determined by the latter."
"An experimental study has been made of a shallow ridged-cavity crossed-slot antenna to determine its feasibility for operation in the 240- to 400-MHz band. The various trends are summarized for the VSWR response characteristics as the cavity and slot parameters are varied. The wideband antenna characteristics using a ridged cavity configuration are demonstrated. Based on the limited amount of data obtained from the experimental model, the VSWR is < 2.7:1 from 240 to 270 MHz and < 2.1:1 from 290 to 400 MHz for a cavity with a maximum dimension of 33 by 33 by 4 in. Measured radiation patterns with the cavity mounted on a finite-size fiat ground plane are shown."
"The design of multiple edge blinders for pyramidal horn reflector antennas is discussed. The blinders eliminate high sidelobes in the azimuthal plane near90\\degfor horizontal polarization at 4, 6, and 11 GHz. The successful design of multiple edge blinders for simultaneous operation in each of the three common carrier bands depends upon the suppression of an off-axis major lobe at 4 GHz and grating lobes which typically appear at 6 and 11 GHz. Using the blinder array factor and element pattern, it is shown that these lobes can be suppressed by properly choosing the blinder tilt angle\\beta_{c}, the inclination of an individual blinder edge\\delta, and an adequate number of edgesN."
"An experimental system for measuring the electrical properties of antennas embedded in moist sand is described. Measured antenna input admittances for bare linear and circular-loop antennas in sand are compared with theory. Insulated linear and circular-loop antennas with the dielectric constant of the insulation comparable to that of the surrounding medium are considered. Measured input admittances of linear antennas with different insulation sizes and dielectric constants are used to illustrate the effect of the insulation on the admittance. Measured input admittances for the spherically insulated circular-loop antenna are compared with theory and are found to be in good agreement."
"The axial field distribution near the focus of a collimating system subject to astigmatism is examined. It is shown that a doubly-peaked focusing response results and that the aperture efficiency is increased with a greater illumination taper. The results are applicable to a paraboloidal reflector with different foci in the two principal planes."
"The geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) as formulated by R. G. Kouyoumjian has been applied to predict the radiation characteristics of hyperboloidal subreflectors with laterally defocused feeds. In caustic or multicaustic directions the scattered fields are determined using an equivalent ring current placed along the edge of the subreflector. The theoretical results are compared to measured amplitude and phase data. In order to improve the agreement, the blocking effects of the feed horn have been accounted for using the geometrical theory of diffraction. The calculated subreflector fields have been used to illuminate a paraboloid from which the scattered field is determined by physical optics. The results are compared to those obtained using a laterally defocused equivalent paraboloid."
"Using recent developments of the geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD), the completeE- andH-plane patterns of Cassegrain antennas are computed. The pattern in the main beam region is computed by conventional aperture integration methods and the GTD analysis is used to evaluate the far-out lobes caused by spillover and by various edge diffraction processes. The effects of the edge curvature and surface curvature are included in the computations."
"Interference patterns are calculated for a horizontal dipole laid on the surface of a stratified medium with both anisotropic permittivity and permeability tensors. The anisotropy in permitivity affectts the radiated fields in the endfire direction, and the anisotropy in permeability affects those in the broadside direction. The effects of anisotropy are illustrated for various cases."
"The fields radiated by a feed structure consisting of a dielectric sphere placed in front of, but displaced from, the open end of a corrugated pipe with quarter-wave teeth, carrying the HE11mode, are derived. It is shown that this feed system has near-circular far-field characteristics with increased on-axis gain. The feed also has a reduced input VSWR due to the aperture-sphere separation. Theoretical expressions are derived for the radiated far-field components, by treating the off-set sphere as a microwave lens. Experimental results obtained from a test feed confirm the theoretical calculations made."
"The theoretical scattering solution for a plane wave incident normally on a lossy dielectric multilayer circular cylinder of infinite length is outlined. Numerical values of the modal scattering coefficient for TE and TM modes are given for several single and multilayer cylinders. Verifications of the results are described. The values may serve as reference data."
"Aircraft enhancement of troposcatter signal intensity on two troposcatter paths in the State of Washington has been experimentally verified by monitoring aircraft in the common volumes with an air traffic control radar. Observed enhancements usually lasted for several minutes, but occurred only if the aircraft was within a few kilometers of the great-circle path."
"An experimental method is developed and tested for measurement of coupling between two monopoles. It is shown that experiments support theoretical predictions and that use of appropriate loads allows a large reduction of mutual coupling."
"Evaluation of the Kirchhoff integral which arises in the far-field computation of radiation from large aperture antennas frequently causes computational difficulty. This communication illustrates the utility of evaluating the integral in terms of end-point contributions. The special case of a pyramidal horn-reflector antenna is considered."
"The dispersion relation for guided waves in a warm drifting uniaxial electron plasma is derived for the case of large drift velocities using relativistic transformations. The phase characteristics of the \"fast,\" \"slow,\" and \"waveguide\" waves are presented and compared with the results of the nonrelativistic treatment. Significant differences are noted for small values of the normalized empty guide cutoff frequency and large drift velocities."
"The relative advantages of several common numerical integration algorithms used in computing two-dimensional phase integrals are evaluated."
"An antenna is described which utilizes two propagating modes in a circular waveguide. These modes are theTM_{11}andTE_{11}, which are complementary. The phase and amplitude is adjusted at the aperture so that both modes are in phase and of equal amplitudes. The resulting pattern is circularly symmetric having equalE- andH-patterns with extremely low back radiation."
"Describes a computer program labelled RCVERT. This is a program for analyzing radiation from arrays of parallel vertical thin-wire antennas over the horizontal surface of an imperfectly conducting earth. The effects of the imperfectly conducting earth are accounted for approximately by using the method of reflection coefficients"
"Another approach to the boundary-value problem is considered. Previously the internal and external fields were matched, in an average sense, across the gap. Here a quasi-static analysis is employed that does not require an assumption about the field distribution in the gap. However, the method appears to be useful only for small gaps. Using either method, it is shown that typically 15 percent of the incident power in the cable is converted to external radiation and typically 20 percent is transferred into surface waves in the dielectric jacket."
"An analytical and experimental investigation of the radiation properties of theH-plane sectoral surface wave horn, excited in theTE_{10}mode, is described in this paper. The surface wave horn antenna utilizing an unsymmetrical radial surface wave is described. The antenna consists of an inductively reactive horizontal surface coincident with they = 0plane of a cylindrical coordinate system (y, \\phi,\\rho). This surface is confined between two conducting walls located at\\phi = \\pm\\alpha(where\\alphais the flare angle of the horn). Given the flare length, variation of the on-axis gain of the horn is analytically investigated, and design procedure for determining optimum\\alpha, in order to obtain maximum on-axis gain, is indicated."
"An extension of Rusch's asymptotic physical optics (APO) diffraction theory as applied to a parabolic antenna is presented. This extension provides a continuous solution throughout the shadow boundary region. The complete field expressions and the associated \"new\" physical optics diffraction coefficients are derived. Using the solution, the diffraction pattern for a 10-ft diameter focal plane parabola at 6 GHz is calculated."
"It has been found experimentally that the efficiency of radiation of the slot mode in slotted waveguide antennas increases with the slot width. The excitation of the slot mode can be prevented by covering the slot with a thin film of metal. Alternatively, the slot may be covered with a sheet of dielectric to suppress the slot mode."
"The current distribution of the \"hula-hoop\" antenna is studied and its radiation resistance is considered. It is analyzed by being decomposed into an unbalanced-driven type and a balanced-driven type, on the assumption that the ground is a perfect conductor. Since the balanced type already has been analyzed, this paper is devoted to the unbalanced type, which is called a ring antenna. We present calculated and measured current distributions, and show that the calculated values of the radiation resistance are near21(2kc)^{2}(kc: electrical length of the distance between the antenna and ground) which agree with those calculated by the Poynting vector method."
"The aim of this work is to rectify and expand upon an error analysis contained in a previous paper by Goldhirsh and Katz [1] dealing with the feasibility of estimating raindrop spectra using multiple wavelength radars. The revised error analysis demonstrates that radars operating atKband (\\lambda = 1cm) andSband (\\lambda = 10cm) may give rise to acceptable accuracies when used for the estimation of rain rate and liquid water content."
"Methods of obtaining the vertical angles of arrival of microwaves on a line-of-sight radio path using microwave holographic techniques, with or without an additional reference source, are reported."
"Using improved techniques for computing spheroidal wave functions, the exact far-field scattering cross sections (backscattering, forward scattering, bistatic scattering, and total scattering) for a variety of perfectly conducting prolate spheroids and for axial incidence of a plane electromagnetic wave, are obtained in the Rayleigh and resonance regions extending to the sixth maximum of the backscattering cross section in each case and selected results are presented. It is noted that some of the previous computations existing in the literature for the spheroid with an axial ratio of 10 are in error. Experimental data collected from various sources are compared with the computed curves of this paper and are found to be in excellent agreement."
"The first Born approximation is applied to propagation of a spherical wave through a layer of random irregularities to an aperture antenna. The effect of the receiving aperture on measurements of the variance of in-phase and quadrature components of the received signal, and the variances of their spatial derivatives is determined. In the weak scattering limit, these quantities are related to the scintillation index, mean-square phase fluctuations, mean-square angle-of-arrival fluctuations, and fading rates. Physical situations corresponding to the generic problem considered here include satellite communication through ionospheric fluctuations, solar wind observations, observations through irregularities caused by instabilities in barium release clouds, etc. Numerical results are presented which show the aperture effect for irregularities with power law spectra of the formS(K) \\propto (1 + K^{2}L_{0}^{2})^{-N/2}for values of the spectral indexNranging from 3 to 5 and for many ratios of the three lengths, turbulent outer scaleL_{0}, aperture radius, and Fresnel length. These results are presented in convenient form for estimating the aperture effect in many cases of interest. Aperture effects (aperture smoothing) generally dominate the behavior of the spatial derivatives, while a nearfield effect is shown which causes enhancement of the variance of the in-phase fluctuations over the value predicted ignoring the receiving aperture. It is suggested that this effect may be useful to explain some aspects of observed gigahertz scintillation."
"An ideal telescope structure would deform, when tilted, in a homologous way, from one paraboloid of revolution to another one. Conventionally designed telescopes approach this condition already to some degree, special designs to a very high degree, and a measure for the degree of this approach is suggested. An equation is presented for the deviations from homology if an antenna is adjusted at zenith angle\\thetaand observes at angle\\phi; it contains only two structural parameters for alt-azimuth mounts (three for polar mounts). The choice of the best adjustment angle is discussed; this is basically different for both types of mount, and examples are given. Supported at two elevation bearings, conventional telescopes will generally show a strong gravitational astigmatism which may be corrected at the secondary mirror, thus improving the astronomical performance considerably. Two possible correction methods are suggested. Several of the equations presented are checked with the example of the 140-ft telescope at Green Bank, W. Va. Good agreement is obtained between detailed computer analysis and equations, and between analysis and astronomically obtained data. Suggested improvements for the 140-ft (applicable also to other telescopes) would diminish the deviations from homology by a factor of 2.5, and the remaining residuals then are brought below the internal inaccuracy of the surface panels. The astigmatic correction thus is advisable as well as sufficient."
"The problem of pulse propagation through a finite turbulent layer is considered. Undistorted pulse transmission is obtained if the spectral width of the pulse is much less than the carrier frequency and the pulse duration is less than the coherence time of the medium."
"The mechanisms of tropospheric microwave propagation for a linear segmented profile of the refractive index are summarized. There is an attempt to generalize the profile of this type and investigate different radio wave propagation conditions from the standpoint of the coherence theory of microwave tropospheric diffraction. In particular, there is discussion concerned with the whispering gallery modes in the troposphere. It seems unlikely these will be excited. Thus, the reflections from the atmospheric layers and the trapped modes under superrefraction conditions account mainly for the long distance tropospheric propagation from this standpoint."
"A numerical technique for solving the high frequency approximation electromagnetic pulse (EMP) equations is presented. The Lorentz model of the secondary electron current is used, thereby achieving a result valid for a burst above the ground and observer at any altitude. Comparisons of the results of this technique and those techniques which assume an ohmic secondary electron current are made, and it is found that they are identical for observations below 40 km but differ markedly above 80 km."
   "A parametric analysis of the coherent electromagnetic losses due to scattering from volume weak inhomogeneities is reported. It is shown that even in the case of very weak inhomogeneities, the loss could be appreciable in a resonance region and thus play a more dominant role than conductivity losses."

"A synthesis method is presented for determining an excitation of an arbitrary (but fixed) planar source configuration. The desired radiation pattern is specified over all or part of the visible region. It may have multiple and/or shaped main beams with low sidelobes. The iterative sampling method is used to find an excitation of the source which yields a radiation pattern that approximates the desired pattern to within a specified tolerance. In this paper the method is used to calculate excitations for line sources, linear arrays (equally and unequally spaced), rectangular apertures, rectangular arrays (arbitrary spacing grid), and circular apertures. Examples using these sources to form patterns with shaped main beams, multiple main beams, shaped sidelobe levels, and combinations thereof are given."
"This paper presents typical results of measurements made on a square corrugated horn and also one with a small rectangular aperture that was designed to generate an elliptical beam for either of two orthogonally polarized signals."
"A new type of holographic antenna based on the principle of the volume hologram is proposed. The characteristics of the prototype are examined. The antenna has a unidirectional beam with a front-to-back ratio of 20 dB. The practical frequency handwidth is about 10 percent of the center frequency. The antenna is unique in that the feed point is placed in the plane of the holographic plate so that both feeder and the holographic plate could be made out of one printed circuit board for easy flush mount installation or mass production, although the feeder of the prototype antenna was a pyramidal horn."
"The fields scattered from small dielectric spheres illuminated by a plane wave have been computed as part of a study of spherical dielectric antennas. Studies of scattering of 3 cm wavelength from a 6.6 cm diameter sphere of dielectric constant between 2 and 3 show large regions on the surface of the sphere where the Poynting vector is inwardly directed. These regions form sidelobes of inwardly directed power density between the sidelobes of outwardly directed power density in the principal planes. Away from the sphere the angular extent of the centripetal power flow is reduced until they disappear at 2-3 cm from the surface."
"Measured attenuations associated with a variety of cloud conditions at wavelengths near 8.6 and 3.2 mm are reported. Two specific events, during which heavy rain clouds covered the sky, are examined and statistical data collected over a six-month period on a variety of cloud types are presented. The number of observations of some cloud types was not large and it was not possible to account for the gaseous attenuation with sufficient accuracy to get reliable values for the attenuation by the cloud droplets for a number of cloud types. The clouds causing the largest attenuations were the rain-bearing cumulonimbus ones. Of the nonrain clouds the two types for which the sample sizes are adequate and attenuations are sufficient for meaningful conclusions are stratocumulus and cumulus, their 35 GHz/95 GHz mean attenuation values being 0.18/0.61 dB and 0.12/0.34 dB, respectively."
"A simple high-frequency asymptotic expression for the backscattered field from a semi-infinite hollow circular cylinder is derived from the exact Weiner-Hopf solution. The resultant equations are valid for both polarizations and can be easily numerically evaluated. Comparisons of the computed results and the measured data acquired through the utilization of a sub-nanosecond pulse radar system are generally good."
"Fade depth and space diversity statistics of propagation along earth-satellite paths have been calculated from radar reflectivity data of rain using modeling procedures. The reflectivity data base was obtained during the summer of 1973 at Wallops Island, Va., using a high resolutionSband radar interfaced with a computer and digital processing system. Fade statistics have been calculated for various path angles at several frequencies between 13 and 100 GHz. Subsequent analysis has demonstrated the ability to predict the following: 1) fade statistics at other path elevation angles given similar type statistics at a particular path angle, 2) space diversity statistics at other frequencies, given similar type statistics at a particular frequency, and 3) fade statistics at a third frequency given similar type statistics at two other frequencies. Although a specific data base was used pertaining to the climatology at Wallops Island, the techniques developed are general and may be applied to existing or future \"fade measurements\" at other climatological locations."
"Existing microwave radiometer technology now provides a suitable method for remote determination of the ocean surface's absolute brightness temperature. To extract the brightness temperature of the water from the antenna temperature, an unstable Fredholm integral equation of the first kind is solved. Fourier transform techniques are used to invert the integral after it is placed into a cross correlation form. Application and verification of the methods to a two-dimensional modeling of a laboratory wave tank system are included. The instability of the ill-posed Fredholm equation is examined and a restoration procedure is included which smooths the resulting oscillations. With the recent availability and advances of fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques, the method presented becomes very attractive in the evaluation of large quantities of data. Actual radiometric measurements of sea water are inverted using the restoration method, incorporating the advantages of the FFT algorithm for computations."
"The use of the current distribution method to analyse the field in the image space of a spherical Gregorian antenna when the main dish is illuminated by a linearly polarized plane wave is discussed. It is shown that the incident field distribution at the subdish is rather irregular, although it can be approximated by a smooth Gaussian distribution curve. In addition, it is possible to design a simple corrugated circular horn, so that the field at its aperture closely matches the incident field. As a result, a high efficiency wide-band system can be achieved."
"A paraboloidal reflector, offset fed with a corrugated conical horn, has been examined as a possible antenna for use in millimeter wave communications systems when minimization of interference is an important consideration. Low far-out and back-lobe radiation were primary objectives. Experimentally obtained data, representative of performance at 37 GHz, is presented. When appropriately shielded to limit spillover, levels more than 75 dB below the main beam maximum have been obtained in the far-out and back-lobe regions."
"Previous investigation of the use of the singularity expansion method (SEM) for analyzing antennas or scatterers has concentrated on the behavior of currents and charges on a conducting body. In this paper the previous work is extended by defining the far-field natural modes for the linear antenna. The transient radiation pattern is then computed for a step-excited center-fed linear antenna."
"A novel approach for systematically deriving the complex poles and residues of a structure from a set of time-domain data is presented. The method is based on Prony's algorithm which involves the inversion of two matrices and a solution of the zeros of annth degree polynomial,nbeing the number of desired poles. Two numerical examples are presented and several numerical advantages of this method are discussed."
"The far-field radiated waveform and field pattern from a thin dipole antenna in the transmission line approximation are considered when the antenna is driven by a voltage generator of waveformV_{0}u(t), whereu(t)is the unit step function. The antenna is loaded with a tapered form of loading and is permitted to include reactance as well as resistance. Analytical and numerical solutions for the far-field pattern and waveform are discussed. In particular, the effects of parallel resistive and inductive loading are presented."
"Planar waveguide array structures in which some form of dielectric matching is introduced, either in the form of a continuous sheet above the array face or dielectric plugs in the apertures, have received considerable attention in the literature. An alternative construction has one central dielectric fin or two edge dielectric fins in each rectangular waveguide aperture. Schaedla [2] has given a theoretical analysis for the first type of phased array but does not quote numerical results. In this paper computed results are compared with experimental measurements for simulated array faces of both types. Some conclusions are given regarding the comparative match-scan performance of fin-loaded, fully loaded, and empty waveguides. These results suggest certain advantages for the fin-loaded array configuration."
"The admittance problem solution of a TEM excited annular slot antenna embedded in an infinite perfectly conducting ground plane is accomplished in the rigorous Maxwell equation-boundary value sense. The net result is a complete closed form solution for the admittance which includes the effects of all beyond-cutoff higher order TM modes. Infinite integrals related to the TEM admittance and to perturbations produced by the presence of higher order TM modes are solved in an approximate manner. The TEM admittance solution obtained is shown to compare favorably with admittance values accurately determined by numerical integration. The presence of beyond-cutoff higher order TM modes is shown to produce a minor effect to the annular slot admittance. The form of the admittance solution reported upon herein is such that the results may be readily applied in estimating the input admittance of physical annular slot antennas without recourse to the usual infinite integral reduction problem."
"Deep fading, e.g., > 40 dB, was observed at 9.6 GHz on a 150 km path with terminals at 3025 and 3300 m elevations and with no significant illumination of the earth's surface. Fades at two antennas separated horizontally by 100 m were largely uncorrelated. Phase variability was also measured and is presented in terms of spectra and coherency between antennas with 10 m and 100 m horizontal spacing."
"A grooved-dielectric flat radome panel is analyzed in terms of an arbitrary direction of incidence onNplanar slabs each of which is dielectrically anisotropic, homogeneous, and lossless. Using this model for the grooved panel, transmission coefficients of 90 percent or greater over a 10:1 frequency band and over0\\degto60\\degincidence angle are predicted and demonstrated experimentally. Measurements are presented on two panels from 3 to 35 GHz."
"A bent thin wire in the shape of an L is analyzed in free space to determine the transient scattering characteristics by the application of the singularity expansion method (SEM) to a coupled set of Hallén-like equations. The principal results of a parametric study to determine the effect of the bend position on the complex resonant frequencies are reported here. The frequency and the time domain responses are given for several cases of plane wave illumination using the SEM and results are compared to the conventional Fourier transform method."
"The situation of a solid cylindrical antenna excited by a narrow circumferential gap is considered, and an approximation which is realistic, simple, and very accurate is obtained for the aperture electric field."
"A generalization of Dolph's method for the synthesis of discrete antenna arrays is applied to six different symmetric line arrays. Based on these examples, it is concluded that 1) the field patterns of optimized symmetric line arrays with the same number of elements and with the same aperture are virtually indistinguishable and 2) optimized arrays with an odd number of elements are substantially better, in general, than arrays with an even number of elements."
"The simulation of the tropospheric scatter mechanism by Birkemeier et al. [1], [2] has been extended to include the computation of the instantaneous variation of the average power for 1-h data segments. This average can be interpreted as a measurement of the spatial variation of the refractivity turbulence within an elevated layer of the atmosphere and can serve as a guide to the interpretation of experimental data."
"A design method for a horn-reflector antenna, which has a beam of arbitrary cross section, is developed. To show the effectiveness of the design theory, the measured data of an electrical model of Japan's domestic communications satellite antenna of this type are shown in comparison with calculated results. The design theory is based on geometrical optics, and is applicable not only to a horn-reflector antenna, but also to any reflector antenna. At the first step of the design theory, the shape of the wavefront near the aperture is determined to correspond to desired beam shape. The shape of the reflector is then determined by the law of the optical path."
"Constant impedance boundary conditions have been used by many authors to obtain mode reflection and transmission coefficients for propagation across a land-sea discontinuity. The impedance boundary conditions are here replaced by exact boundary conditions and similar formulae are obtained for propagation between a diffuse inhomogeneous isotropic ionosphere and a homogeneous isotropic earth. These formulae permit the use of any ionospheric model with vertical inhomogeneity although some simplification results if impedance boundary conditions are used at the ground. A numerical example is given to illustrate the significance of the formulae."
"Simultaneous measurements of phase and amplitude variability were made on a 64 km slant path using five radio frequencies: 9.55, 19.1, 22.2, 25.4, and 33.3 GHz. The three middle frequencies were chosen for their relation to water vapor absorption. The amplitude data show occasional fades in excess of 20 dB superimposed on ubiquitous smaller scintillations of several decibels. The latter generally increased with radio frequency and the fluctuations at the different frequencies were only moderately correlated (e.g., < 0.7). Neither phase nor amplitude variability show effects on the molecular resonance of water vapor."
"To apply the method of steepest descent to the evaluation of lateral waves when the observing point and the source are located in different media with respect to each other, it is recommended that one first change the variable of integration according to Snell's law and then apply the method of operators. The merits and limitations of this method, compared with the usual direct one, are discussed."
 "A dynamic method for the measurement of forward scattering in a radio anechoic chamber is described. The quantity determined is the induced-field-ratio (IFR) of conducting cylinders. The determination of the IFR is highly sensitive to 1) multiple scattering between the cylinder and the obpring antenna and 2) extraneous scattering from the lining of the anechoic chamber. In order to eliminate the influence of multiple scattering, the measurements are made dynamically, i.e., the cylinders are mounted on a moving cart. The consequences of this movement are analyzed. Experimental data are presented in terms of the dynamic measurements. The influence of extraneous scattering is evaluated and an indication of a method for reducing errors due to extraneous scattering is given."
"The effect of rain depolarization has been calculated as a function of rain rate, path length, and frequency based upon Oguchi's calculations of differential phase shift and differential attenuation due to oblate raindrops. The experimental values generally agree with the theoretical predictions, but the latter tend to underestimate the effect. This underestimation is possibly due to some near-field effect plus the errors introduced by approximating the raindrops as ellipsoids, especially at high rain rates. Nevertheless, theoretical and experimental values of the level of depolarization due to rain generally differ by no more than 3dB."
 "Practical and convenient monographs, for obtaining the phase centers of corrugated conical horns and conical horns excited in TE11mode, are presented. Given the length of horn, the radius of aperture, and the distance from aperture to observation point along the horn axis, the location of the phase center can be directly found on these nomographs."
   "New phenomena have been reported recently in connection with Gaussian beam interaction with a plane dielectric interface, namely, the deterioration of the reflected and refracted beams from shapes predicted by geometric optics, and the generation of higher order components that cause angular beam deflection. Any bounded symmetric beam, that is not necessarily Gaussian, can be comprised in terms of angular spectra of plane waves. Utilizing such a modal expansion, a model of the interaction process that seems to point out the generality of the phenomena involved for bounded symmetrical beams with any cross-section is presented. Results for two examples of beam profiles, a plane wave of limited extent and a Cauchy Profile, are given. Comparison with prior results obtained for the Gaussian beam and careful examination of the respective spectral functions demonstrate close correspondence between the results. This adds credence to the general approach presented here which can be applied to bounded symmetrical beams of general shape."
             "Requirements for a unique solution to inverse scattering problems with a generalized impedance boundary condition - a subset of which is the Leontovich condition - are proven. It also shows the insufficiencies to recover both the scatterer as well as material surface characteristics from its exterior field until proper postulates at the interface are established."
             "The results of a theoretical and experimental investigation are presented for a dual mode horn fed offset parabola for feed displacements of\\pm7wavelengths about the focus in a direction along the offset axis. Beamwidths, sidelobe levels, relative gain, and crosspolarization patterns exhibit approximately equal E and H plane beamwidths as the feed is moved, along with wide angle sidelobes outside the main ridged beam that are similar in level to those of the same antenna with the feed on focus. The cross-polarization pattern levels diminish as the feed is moved off focus. The ridged main patterns have a shape similar to that of a corrugated horn with the same quadratic phase error. Therefore for some applications, it should be possible to use a defocused offset parabolic reflector rather than a corrugated horn, thereby effecting a sizeable decrease in antenna volume."
           "The diffraction of a high-frequency scalar wave by a plane screen can be treated by Keller's geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD). The GTD solution fails however at the edge of the screen and on shadow boundaries where the solution is infinite and discontinuous. These defects are overcome by the \"uniform asymptotic theory of edge diffraction\" (UAT) which is an extension of GTD. Starting from a new Ansatz that involves Fresnel integrals in an appropriate manner, the uniform theory provides a high-frequency asymptotic solution of the diffraction problem that is uniformly valid near the edge and the shadow boundaries, i.e., the solution satisfies the edge condition and is finite and continuous at shadow boundaries. Away from these regions the UAT solution reduces to that of Keller's theory. So far, the uniform theory has been successfully applied to diffraction through a slit or a circular aperture in a plane screen, and to problems of reflection and diffraction at an open-ended parallel-plane waveguide. Further extensions of UAT to electromagnetic diffraction by a plane screen, and to diffraction (scalar or electromagnetic) by a curved wedge, will be discussed."
           "Static and dynamic radiation patterns are investigated, and the differences are brought out by a statistical analysis. The two types of patterns can be separately identified because the static pattern represents the case in which the beam is stationary as the target moves, and the dynamic pattern represents the case in which the beam is electronically scanned through the target. In each type of pattern, the spatial angle for which high correlation occurs is computed from an approximate analysis. That information, when combined with the error fields resulting from randomized phase shifter quantization, is used to predict the detailed differences between the two types of patterns. A knowledge of the difference is important in selecting the least expensive method of phased array pattern testing, particularly for large antennas. The radiation pattern ensemble statistics in the presence of elemental amplitude and phase errors were found to be the same for either type of pattern. Therefore, uncorrelated samples of either pattern will establish the array radiation characteristics. However, it is shown both in an approximate analysis and experimentally that quite a difference can exist between individual static and dynamic patterns. The exact amount of difference depends on many factors, but primarily on the aperture size and the number of phase-shifter bits. In the effort described here, the various errors throughout the antenna are characterized by their mean and standard deviation in a probability distribution function. As a result, their effect on radiation patterns is described in terms of probabilities. The general analytical approach of Ruze (Ref.1) and Adams (Ref. 2) is used as a background. The analysis is divided into several sections. The ensemble statistics of the errored radiation pattern are first described and examined for sensitivity to the type of pattern. Next, the differences between static and dynamic patterns are indicated by reference to spatial autocorrelation functions and heuristic aperture analysis. The analysis, though approximate, appears to provide useful results, as illustrated by the good comparison between theoretical and experimental patterns for a 48-element linear array."
"A method is described for measuring the admittance matrix of an antenna array considered as an N-port network. The method utilizes the properties of hybrid junctions to apply at the antenna ports, taken two at a time, with all other ports short-circuited, two pairs of incident voltages of known amplitudes and phases. Measurements are obtained of the reflections coefficients (\\Gamma) and of the input admittances (Y_{in}) at the pair of antenna ports under test for both modes of excitations. The desired admittance parameters are then easily determined from the measured quantities as shown in the formulation given below. The proposed method applies to arbitrary arrays and is gererally easier to implement than those that are now available [1-4]."
  "Phased arrays with interelement spacings greater than one half wavelength result in grating lobes whose amplitudes approach that of the amplitude of the main beam. These grating lobes can be reduced by making the interelement spacing aperiodic. Grating lobe reduction has been accomplished by deterministic aperiodic spacing, e.g., logarithmic spacing; by thinning, i.e., randomly removing elements from an array in which elements are spaced one-half wavelength apart; and by locating elements in a random manner. The random arrays that have been treated (Ref. 1-4) have had probability density functions of the element positions which would require a significant fraction of the elements to be spaced less than one half wavelength apart. These analyses, therefore, appear to be restricted to arrays whose elements are less than one half wavelength in size. In the millimeter and shorter wavelength regions where the typical antenna may be a dish or horn, spacings of one half wavelength or less are often precluded from consideration so that the previous analyses are inapplicable."
           "As radio astronomers become increasingly interested in observing at millimeter and submillimeter wave lengths, the need arises for the measuring and setting of the surface shape of parabolic reflectors to a higher accuracy than is obtainable using conventional techniques. Typically the accuracy required is greater than 0.1mm. The method described in this paper measures the curvature of the surface with a high accuracy at many points along a radius of the surface. These curvature values are then integrated twice with respect to the distance along the surface by an on-line computer, the result being the Y coordinate of the surface as a function of distance along the radius. This measurement is repeated for different radii, the resultant data being used to generate the best fit parabola to the surface and deviations from this best fit. Measurements made on an 11 meter radio telescope yield results for the RMS surface accuracy that are consistent with the antennas measured performance at millimeter wavelengths. Two separate measurements of the same surface indicate a measurement accuracy of 0.05mm RMS. The time taken to survey the 11 meter antenna was less than 4 hours for 48 radii and greater than3 \\times 10^{5}data points."
     "The goal of this research is to develop simulated bio-tissues for modeling dosimetry studies at frequencies ranging from 1-12.4 GHz usingX-band frequencies. To simulate electromagnetic interactions at a lower frequency, the model used can be reduced in size by a linear factorS. Effective scaling [1] is achieved if,\\omega_{m} = S\\omega,\\varepsilon_{m} = \\varepsilon,\\mu_{m},\\tan\\delta_{m} = \\tan\\deltawith the subscriptmdenoting the model."
      "This paper reports on the accuracy of far-field patterns determined from near-field measurements on a 499 element C-band phased array antenna. Hemispherical far-field patterns were determined from near-field measurements and principle plane cuts of these patterns were compared to the same cuts made on a farfield range. Comparisons are sheen for both the sum and azimuth difference patterns for three scan positions of the phased array."
      "This talk highlights often-overlooked or poorly treated aspects in G/T error analyses for satellite communication earth terminals. In particular, correction factors due to star size, differential system temperature, antenna pointing, and refractive attenuation used in G/T measurements are discussed in detail."

                            "It has long been recognized that the electromagnetic (EM) source terms in the region close to a nuclear explosion consist of Compton and photoelectric currents and collision-induced conductivity [1]. These source terms create a pulse of EM field (EMP) both in the region itself and outside the source region [2]. For an object outside the source region, the EMP effect is produced through free-field coupling [3]. For an object inside the region, the EMP effect should be obtained by solving the boundary value problem using the current and the conductivity directly as the driving source."
"The critical demands of the oceanographic industry have created the need for more accurately designed and manufactured electro-mechanical cables. Theoretical design procedures have progressed rapidly but there has been a lag in the progress in manufacturing technology. Existing manufacturing procedures generate conditions that produce a significant initial stress unbalance. The result is that actual cable performance is substantially different from that predicted from the design routine. New manufacturing methods have now been developed to overcome this manufacturing technology gap, so that cables can now be manufactured that will more exactly meet the desired specifications."
"Underwater repair of electromechanical cables can be reliably accomplished by divers with a minimum amount of training and off-the-shelf materials. The technique combines the use of standard electrical wire crimping equipment, tygon tubing, and RTV to accomplish the splice. The splices have been successfully tested in the Civil Engineering Laboratory's (CEL) pressure vessel facility with cyclic pressures to 500 psig (34 atm) and temperatures to 3°C. These splices have also been used successfully to effect repairs at sea for both data and power conductors to depths of 70 ft (22 m). These simple techniques allow repair of electrical systems in-situ as opposed to resur- facing before effecting repairs."
"Two high strength, low weight, prototype, electromechanical cables have been developed for use in remote control of undersea systems operating to depths of 20,000 feet. Both cables incorporate tension members of KEVLAR-49 as the load-bearing section. Design details are given for each cable. Recommendations are made of the most effective ways to utilize KEVLAR-49 in undersea cables, as well as hazards to be avoided with this new material."
"The breakage loads of nine different small mooring lines are experimentally related to time of immersion in a marine environment. Samples of a single steel wire, five different strands ranging from 0.05 inch 1 × 7 to 7/64 inch 1 × 19, and three small wire ropes 3/32 inch 7 × 7 were fully immersed in Puget Sound for 38, 115, and 150 days. Tensile test data from the immersed samples are analyzed and compared with data from control samples. The time rate of change of breakage load during approximately 6 months of exposure is given for bare lubricated steel wire and strand, galvanized steel strand, aluminized rope, and PVC coated wire rope. Results indicate that the rate of corrosion damage of bare lubricated steel wires and strands decreases from a high initial value to a lower constant value. An expression in terms of time, initial wire radius and a pseudo corrosion rate for the corrosion damage (as measured by breakage load) is developed on the assumption that the lost area can be modeled as an annulus."
"The provisions of the Ocean Dumping Act are enforced by the D. S. Coast Guard. Traditional maritime law enforcement techniques must be augmented with modern scientific tools to adequately police the yearly dumping of more than 10,000,000 tons of industrial wastes and sew- age sludge and 40,000,000 cubic yards of dredge spoils. The precise location of suspected violations can be pinpointed with Loran-C. Scientific assay techniques are available to identify the particular pollutant and its source. A Coast Guard-developed, all-weather, long-range, airborne surveillance and classification system shows promise of providing evidence of violations. The most effective tool may be the Ocean Dumping Surveillance System consisting of a Loran-C receiver, clock, dump monitor and recorder, to be carried by all dump vessels, that makes a permanent record of the vessel's track for use as evidence of improper dumping."
"A cooperative cable design exercise is described in which the goals were a torque-balanced array cable with 20 conductors, a design strength of at least 15,000 pounds, a maximum diameter of 1 inch, and zero weight in seawater. These goals were to be achieved without increasing normal cable diameter; i.e., with no component the sole function of which was to decrease in-water weight. Three design approaches are discussed. The first is a model design, offered by the Naval Undersea Center to two cable companies for consideration. The others are changes to the model independently recommended by the companies. Each approach begins with the use of KEVLAR-49 composite tension members as the loadbearing core, and continues with substitution of lightweight materials for other components of the cable. All three end with a 20-conductor cable light enough to float in sea-water. Each design is synopsized and explained. The result is an insight into three different ways in which \"zero weight\" electromechanical cables can be achieved."
"The use of KEVLAR 29 as the strength member in electro-mechanical marine cables is being investigated by the Naval Air Development Center. Cables with diameters between 0.034 inch (0.086 cm) and 0,061 inch (0,155 cm) are addressed. The tensile characteristics of braided KEVLAR 29 cables are shown to require overdesign of cable strength to compensate for variations in tensile properties. Seawater return cables are modelled to predict the transmission line characteristics of KEVLAR and steel cables."
"An electroacoustic system was developed to assist in the study of lake bed material transport. The system consists of miniature acoustic transponders constructed to be replicas of natural pebble-sized bed material, larger benchmark transponders suitable for fixing to bottom mounted structures and a commercial side scan sonar. The transponders are interrogated by the 0.1 ms duration, 100 kHz signal transmitted by the side scan sonar and reply with a 1 ms acoustic burst (95 kHz). The transponder responses are received and recorded by the side scan sonar. The position of the pebble relative to the known benchmark array can be deduced from the display record. The useful range for this system is 20 m to 200 m."
"Marine aquaculturists operating on a large scale continuous basis often find bio-fouling on nets, intake screens, cages and floats to be a serious problem in that it can increase weight and drag, reduce buoyancy and water flow, and compete with the cash crop for available food. Major net system failures, with fouling as a strong contributing factor, have already occurred in several large commercial marine aquaculture operations. The fouling resistance of copper and its alloys is well known. Yet, the corrosion rate of these alloys is sufficiently low that they can likely be used in areas with only modest water flow without any detrimental effects on the culture organisms. The economic incentive for the judicious use of these alloys in certain marine aquacultural applications appears to be substantial."
"The NOAA Data Buoy Office (NDBO) is actively involved in the development of a meteorological and oceanographic drifting buoy system to provide a basic set of simple meteorological parameters during the First GARP Global Experiment (FGGE). One important aspect of planning for the FGGE is the measurement of near surface conditions (barometric pressure and temperature) from an array of buoys in the Southern Hemisphere. Increasing emphasis is also being placed on oceanographic measurements during the FGGE. A drifting buoy system design, with telemetry and position fixing by polar-orbiting satellite, has evolved and is now under test. Preliminary testing has demonstrated the feasibility of successful use of systems of this type in large scale arrays. This paper contains a description of each of the system elements and discusses in detail the results of testing and evaluation to date. Several problem areas are indicated that must be addressed during the next phase of the continuing development effort."
"Present mooring schemes for semi-submersible drilling vessels do not permit it to move its own anchors rapidly. This function must be performed by anchor handling vessels. Because of this constraint the moving of a drilling vessel is dependent upon the anchor handling ship being able to perform this function when necessary. In areas such as the North Sea, weather conditions frequently are such that it is impossible to pick up the anchors and the drilling rig must, therefore, wait until the weather and sea improves. In emergency situations such as well blow out, iceberg danger, severe storms,or other similar conditions where it is mandatory to move on short notice, the Rig Release System provides a fast, safe means of releasing the anchor and allows moving the drilling rig in a relatively short time period."
"The U.S. Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's vehicles with infrared and visual sensors, and Australia's light aircraft fitted with an airborne radiation thermometer and ships from the Australian and New Zealand navies have been combined in a multisystem technique for the detection and measurement of mesoscale warm core eddies off the east coast of Australia. A method for satellite detection of these eddies has been establish ed, the oceanographic features have been delineated, and the acoustic characteristics have been measured directly using the new lightweight array technology."
"Physiographic zonation on the Australian Great Barrier Reef has been mapped experimentally using automated methods of LANDSAT (ERTS)data processing. A selected scene of the Cape Melville area of northern Queensland included outer barrier and inshore reefs, reef-island associations and the mainland coast. LANDSAT-1 digital data recorded in February 1973 was used to produce color-coded: three-band composite imagery; level-sliced single-band imagery; and classified four-band imagery. Each type of imagery, generated by computer, high- lighted different features of reef and coastal zonation. The results were viewed on a TV monitor or used to produce film images at various scales, for direct comparison to charts and aerial photographs. The results provide useful data for: 1) updating current charts; 2) preparing thematic inventories of reef zonation; 3) producing an information base for assessing reef changes."
"A predictive circulation model was formulated from ERTS-1 satellite images and supporting oceanographic cruises. Biannually reversing convection cells driven by heating and cooling of the saline Colorado tidal estuary are curled by the Coriolis effect. These resulting surficial gyres and cross-flowing undercurrents were mapped from photographically enhanced ERTS images. Vertical structure of the water column was measured by repeated ship cruises. Other phenomena too complex or too transient to map with ship data alone were delineated from Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, and ERTS photographs: 1. Internal waves 2. Eddies and upwelling plumes 3. Wind-driven surface layers 4. Cloud lines marking the extent of the sea breeze systems or edges of water masses of different temperatures 5. Orographic indicator of a shoal 6. Tidal phase velocity."
"Oceanographic measurements in the Chukchi Sea during the past four years have shown large variations in temperature and salinity distributions. These variations can be attributed to seasonal differences and to the measurements' proximity to the marginal ice zone. The major seasonal change is a summer intrusion of water through Bering Strait - one that is sometimes concentrated along the coast of Alaska, and at other times is spread all across the Chukchi Sea in a 10-meter thick surface layer. Infrared imagery from a NOAA satellite has recently been used to measure surface temperatures for the entire area. With this technique, the intruding water (8 to 10°C) and the existing winter water (-2 to 0°C) are easily differentiated, even after considerable mixing. The combination of such satellite information with oceanographic cruise data provides a valuable method for studying the pattern of water movement in the Arctic."
"Grab samples of sediment were collected at 530 locations in Lake Michigan, primarily in the southeastern quarter of the lake. Each sample was analyzed in the field and in the laboratory for fallout cesium-137. Twenty five of the samples, collected near the mouth of the St. Joseph River, were also analyzed in the laboratory for 11 other man-made materials known to be dis- charged into the river. Two statistical methods were used to determine if cesium-137 can be used as an environmental tracer to predict the areal distributions of other man-made materials. The results show fallout cesium-137 to be a moderate to good tracer to locate areas of accumulation of plutonium-238, plutonium-239, zinc, copper, chromium, lead, dieldrin, DDT, and PCB in sediment. Little or no correlation is found between fallout cesium-137 and strontium-90 or nickel."
"Settling racks were placed at different locations within Los Angeles Harbor representing a variety of water quality conditions. Larval settlement was monitored quantitatively and qualitatively at monthly intervals for a two year period. Abiotic parameters were measured at monthly intervals and included temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, primary productivity, nitrates, nitrite, NH3 H2S, tidal flux and sediment chemistry. Multivariate statistical techniques were applied in an attempt to define the major physical parameters affecting larval distribution and settlement success. Hierarchical classificatory methods were used to define site and species groups. Normal and inverse hierarchies were used to construct two-way tables to determine environmentally dependent species assemblages. Ordination techniques were applied to determine abiotic trends and define those parameters contributing significantly to settlement success."
"The thermal tolerance of three dominant marine fouling species common to circulating water systems of coastal electric generating stations in Southern California was determined. Of the three species, the bay mussel (Mytilus edulis) was found to be the most tolerant of elevated temperatures. The barnacle (Balanus tintinnabulum) was intermediate, while the hydroid (Syncoryne eximia) exhibited the least tolerance. Although no significant difference was revealed between most Mytilus size classes, a trend toward increased thermal tolerance in larger individuals was indicated. With one exception, significant differences between temperature rise rates and Mytilus ED95's were revealed, however, the pattern was not consistent. Durations required to kill 95 percent (ED95) of the mussels, barnacles, and hydroids tested at three target temperatures were established. These results will be utilized along with additional biological data and engineering design and operating considerations to examine present operating practices and if possible derive an improved heat treatment mode for Southern California Edison Company's San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, Units 2 and 3."
"An evaluation is made of the marine environmental considerations affecting the siting of offshore nuclear power facilities in an 800 square mile area in New York Bight. An oceanographic sampling program was conducted between November 1973 and October 1974, in a region heavily used for transportation, recreation, and ocean dumping. Concurrent physical, chemical and biological measurements were made monthly at 6 to 9 stations from shipboard. Vertical profiles of currents, salinity, temperature and density were obtained with sets of automatic profiling instruments which recorded data at one to five minute intervals for as long as a month at a time. The data generally confirm the results of previous studies of the area but provide new information on the distribution of chemical constituents and on phytoplankton segregated by size fractions. Distinct geographical differences were discerned even in the well mixed winter conditions, representing the influence of the Hedson River, nearby ocean dumping areas, and inlets to adjacent protected bays. Tidal variations in the currents are generally described by an elliptical pattern with the major axis paralleling the coast, but strong winds can overcome the tidal forces, driving the water downwind generally with a set to the the right. Temperature and salinity at depth were spectrally analyzed to determine dominant frequencies and the corresponding amplitudes. Stratification is apparent from April 1974 to September 1974. Despite extreme hydrological variability, all biological communities followed a well-defined seasonal succession. These were significant geographical differences in the biological communities with perceptible anomalies in the vicinity of the offshore dump sites but no areas of low productivity. Evaluations are made of the environmental effects of various offshore power plant locations including dispersion of the thermal plume, biological effects of increased temperature, bottom scour and littoral drift."
"By combining various materials and configurations a broad range of electromechanical cable characteristics is currently available. Because of the combination of high strength with excellent mechanical protection for the electrical core, steel contrahelically armored cables have most frequent use. Other steel strength member configurations are available to vary cable characteristics such as weight and corrosion resistance. When mechanical protection of the electrical core can be sacrificed, the weight and corrosion resistance advantages of the new high strength fibers can become available."
"Difficulty was experienced with bulk-head connectors when these were used over a one year period in equipment on the Arctic sea bed. Failures occurred after periods ranging from three to eleven months. Four instrument packages, each fitted with seven XSG-BCL plastic bulkhead connectors, were recovered and examination showed that all the connectors leaked to some extent. In the case of some of the connectors carrying the battery power, the positive pins were corroded off completely. A modification in the form of an enclosure surrounding the connector is now used. This is completely filled with liquid vaseline after the connection is made. This system has now been used on over fifty connectors, of which only one has leaked and that leakage was minor. The cause of this failure is now under investigation and tests are at present being conducted to eliminate a recurrence, using an alternative filler."
"This paper deals with towing an object through a fluid by means of a cable. For a slender, neutrally buoyant towbody, the planar configuration of the towed system is determined for steady motion and for time-dependent maneuvers of the towing vehicle . A formulation of the finite element method that applies to towed cable dynamics is presented including bending deformation and stretch of the elements, and nodal forces caused by acceleration, distributed weight, and hydrodynamic loading. Although based on established forms for fluid drag, the treatment and expressions for nodal hydrodynamic loading forces are new. The resultant system of equations for the un known nodal displacements is solved by step-by-step integration in time using a scheme that eliminates troublesome longitudinal oscillations. Lumped and distributed systems are compared with respect to the treatment of mass and hydrodynamic loading and the effects of bending stiffness are illustrated."
"Destructive kinking of electromechanical cables, when used to lower heavy objects to the seafloor, has been a serious ocean engineering problem. In an effort to find a solution to these problems, CEL conducted a test and evaluation program on a commercially available swivel/ slipring assembly and a modified version of the same unit. Both units were subjected to mechanical and electrical testing in the laboratory and deep ocean. The units proved to be mechanically reliable, requiring no repair throughout the test program. Electrically, the original slipring assembly would not carry the power required by the operational equipment selected for the deep ocean tests. A new slipring assembly was installed. The ocean tests were conducted using equipment with a history of cable-kinking problems. During two deployments with the swivel/slipring assembly to 3,000 feet, no further problems occurred. This swivel/slipring assembly met all operating requirements and proved to be a reliable system."
"This paper reports on a recent survey of the major ocean disposal site for radioactive wastes on the Pacific coast. This site, located near the Farallon Islands (59 km west of San Francisco), was used from 1946 to 1966 for the disposal of containerized, low-level radioactive waste materials. On the order of 47,000 containers were dumped in three areas within the site during its period of activity."
"The following topics are dealt with: underwater acoustics; buoy systems; underwater cables and connectors; coastal zone management; oceanographic computing; diving technology; economic potential of the ocean; oceanographic education; oceanographic geoscience; information systems; oceanographic instrumentation; marine biology; marine fisheries; marine geodesy; marine materials; marine navigation and communication; mineral resources; marine salvage; nuclear power; oceanographic ships; ocean surveillance and enforcement; offshore facilities; ocean based power systems; remote sensing; technology transfer; undersea vehicles; underwater photography and viewing; and water quality and pollution."
"Hollow glass spheres are widely used as floats at great ocean depth. Experiments under pressure have shown the effect of using various methods of joining two glass hemispheres together (fusing, rubber gaskets, grease, etc.), with successes and failures. The results of various pressure experiments on spheres and the failure of attempts to cause spheres to implode on command when under pressure using mechanical impact, blasting caps and heat are described. Static and cyclic fatigue of spheres under pressure is also covered. A method for over-pressure testing a glass sphere design for a short time to show that such a design is suitable for longterm deep submergence is presented."
"A towed hydroacoustic system that provides rapid and precise estimates of pelagic (mid-water) fish stock abundance has been developed at the University of Washington. The system is self-contained, and therefore suitable for use on \"ships of opportunity.\" It has been used to assess pelagic fish as part of the Coastal Upwelling Ecosystems Analysis program sponsored by the National Science Foundation."
"Mexico is now in process of developing scientific management of its fisheries and promoting full harvesting of its large latent resources. To do this quickly, economically and efficiently the investigators are attempting to apply methods of systems analysis, computer data processing, modern acoustic survey and methods of simplified data recording to develop a systematic methodology. The approach has emphasized concentration on the study of one developed fishery, the Pacific shrimp, and one developing fishery, the Pacific anchovy. As experience is gained the approach is being transferred to the study of other fisheries."
"Proposed offshore nuclear power plants in the South Atlantic Region of the United States present unique problems to the major fisheries of the area. As presently conceived these installations would be sited in waters that coincide with spawning grounds or lie within migratory pathways between offshore spawning sites and inshore nursery grounds of important commercial and recreational species. Effects of entrainment in intake cooling water or heated effluent could profoundly affect stocks of these fisheries unless several factors are taken into consideration. Influence of unique coastal topography on dispersal and concentration of spawning stocks, eggs and larvae of commercial species as well as food organisms is discussed. Preliminary results of long term studies on continental shelfs of the region and estuarine studies in South Carolina are summarized. Research needs necessitated by siting requirements of offshore nuclear power plants are delineated."
"As exploration of the world's oceans continue, our analysis and portrayal of the sea floor topography becomes increasingly important. Such knowledge is necessary not only to maintain the safety of the world's mariner, but it is also essential to conserve and exploit the natural wealth in and under the seas. This paper examines the status and accuracy of current exploration efforts and identifies requirements to satisfy anticipated geodetic and charting needs."
"Summary form only given. With the increasing offshore activity in the scientific and commercial exploration of ocean resources, the requirement for more secure and reliable acoustic command and communication links places ever more stringent requirements on technology. This rationale led to the development of the InterOcean Digital Acoustic Command systems. By employing state-of-the-art techniques from data processing and data communications, and considering both hard wire and RF types of coπrnunication links with their attendant capability of error detection and error rate prediction, an optimally reliable and secure command system has been developed."
"The Research and Management Shoreline (RAMS) Data Bank contains information relative to physical alterations of the shoreline and nearshore areas of Chesapeake Bay for which permits have been granted by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Baltimore and Norfolk Districts. The RAMS Data Bank is designed to provide information to persons making recommendations or decisions at the local, state or federal level relative to subjects such as land use planning, fish and wildlife management, and wetlands utilization. An IBM Model 360-91 Computer utilizing the IBM Generalized Information System stores the data and makes it available to regulatory and advisory agencies. In addition to the basic query capabilities, a capability to graphically display information contained in the data bank has been developed. A wide variety of map scales is available, and any of the information contained in the data base can be superimposed on a map printout."
"The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Underwater Acoustic Data Bank (NAVDAB) was initiated to provide an appropriate data base for development and validation of sonar performance prediction models. The main data bank was in stalled at the Naval Undersea Center with branches at the Naval Underwater Systems Center and the Naval Oeeanographic Office. NAVDAB is administered, under NAVSEA direction, by a Steering Group made up of Navy Laboratory representatives. Initial entries consist primarily of propagation loss data with supporting environmental information, but NAVDAB will include ambient noise, bottom loss, scattering strength, and other appropriate data categories. Access to NAVDAB, either for entry or retrieval of data is through the main bank or one of the branches. Access is avail able to any DOD activity and to others with a need to know certified by NAVSEA Code SEA-06H1."
"This paper describes a data retrieval system for oceanographic purposes, called the HYDROSEARCH Program."
"During dredging and disposal operations, there is an increase in the suspended solids in the area of activity. These resuspended sediments can ad verse impact biota. The suspended solids concentrations during various dredging and disposal operations in San Francisco Bay were monitored. The results of this monitoring were integrated with the results of a suspended solids test per formed at the Bodega Marine Laboratory to develop a matrix of potential adverse effects on indigenous organisms under various suspended solids loadings. The matrix indicates that under winter condition of low temperature and high dissolved oxygen adults of most species should not be adversely influenced during periods of either dredging or disposal. However, during summer months, if temperature increases to above 18°C and dissolved oxygen drops below two parts per million mortality of sensitive species in the lower water column may result during disposal operations. The field investigations indicated that dredging could create a fluff zone at the sediment-water interface which because of its persistence might have adverse influence on benthic organisms."
"An in situ benthic particle collector has been developed and constructed. The ultimate use of the collector is to provide seasonal rates for the input of particulates to the oceanic benthic environment. We plan to test the hypothesis that rapid, down-slope run-off of suspended organic-rich continental shelf sediments and offshore transport of organic detrital particles derived from the coastal upwelling ecosystem off Oregon provide the food source for the highly abundant slope-base benthic fauna. The particle collection system consists of three basic parts: 1) the particle collector with the capacity of three 4.5 m2 collecting surfaces that sequentially roll up for storage, 2) duplicate electronically-timed explosive releases with anchor, and 3) the subsurface flotation unit with radio beacon, flashing stobe light, and radar reflector. The particle collector is designed to remain moored just above the sea floor for up to three months. During this time, three sequential samples can be collected. Exposure times are equal for each of the sample surfaces; however, the duration of the sample exposure period is easily adjusted from hours to months."
"The need for comprehensive studies to evaluate the current environmental status and make environmental impact estimations is constantly increasing. Inherent in these activities is the measurement of a multitude of physical, chemical and biological parameters, Many programs now require the determination of spatial distribution and temporal variation of many key parameters in the open ocean, estuaries, rivers, lakes and harbors. Due to increasing costs and limitations of human and financial resources to carry out these environmental measurement programs it became clear that instrumentation systems must be optimized to produce the maximum amount of useful data at the lowest cost. To meet the need for more efficient data acquisition equipment a system has been developed to continuously pump large volumes of water from accurately known depth and deliver the water to sample containers or analysis equipment located on the survey vessel. An in-situ instrumentation package is attached to the submersible pump to provide for continuous measurement of Conductivity, Salinity, Temperature, Dissolved Oxygen, pH, Turbidity, Redox and Depth. Real time data display permits operational decisions to be made on board the survey vessel with respect to profiling depths, special analysis and the collection of special samples. All data are recorded on digital magnetic tape for subsequent data processing."
"A low power, unattended, ice station for collecting data has been developed to collect synoptic environmental data in polar regions for a period of two years. An array of 10 of these ice stations was installed 250-550 nautical miles north of the Alaskan coast during the spring of 1975. In each station, 24 hours worth of the most recent data, made up of eight 32-bit words, are retained in memory for burst transmission to the RAMS (Random Access Measurement System) receiver in the polar orbiting NIMBUS-F satellite. Surface platform location to a CPE of about 5 km is obtained through doppler measurement of the transmitted signal. This program is part of a continuing Arctic Research in Environmental Acoustics (AREA) project sponsored by the Office of Naval Research, and was performed in cooperation with the Arctic Ice Dynamics Joint Experiment (AIDJEX) to study sea ice dynamics and underwater acoustics ambient noise."
"The design of a shore-recording wave amplitude measuring buoy that uses the changing geometry of its stressed but compliant mooring to determine wave heights is presented. Instrumentation is described to measure the angles of inclination and tension of the base end of the compliant mooring cable which supports the wave following buoy. Transducers, amplifiers and voltage-to frequency converters are installed in pressure housings (at about 150 ft.). The data in the form of analog audio frequency is carried over a 1/2 mile hard wire cable to a shore station where it is converted to digital form and multiplexed on a seven track instrumentation type digital tape recorder. The computer program for data interpretation and wave-spectra results are discussed in a companion paper."
"The field testing of a water quality sensor package developed to measure gross water parameters from buoy and other unattended marine platforms is discussed. The parameters measured are chlorophyll, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, and turbidity. The field testing described was conducted in a closed body of water so that reference data could be readily obtained and periodic inspections made of the sensor package. The package was mounted on an oceanographic buoy throughout the testing and all data was relayed via radio link through the buoy similar to the ocean deployments to follow."
"North Padre Island, South Texas, is a characteristic Texas barrier island complex that is presently undergoing heavy development pressure for energy, recreational and residential uses. The island has a dynamic environment influenced by both short and long term geologic processes. Development usually recognizes the short term processes (hurricanes and storms) but does not consider long term geologic processes (aeolian transport and lagoonal wave erosion). Both natural and man induced erosion results in the loss of the beach and beachfront structures. The removal of beach sand through aerodynamically stable aeolian chutes causes serious sedimentation problems. Improper placement of dredge material alongside channels often results in rapid channel sedimentation. The interaction of man and active geologic processes appears to represent a significant threat to the financial success of island construction and development."
"It was observed during previous field studies [1] that icebergs respond mainly to currents of the water body in which they float. Equations of motion for iceberg drift are derived by assuming that the water drag force is proportional to square of relative velocity of water with respect to the iceberg. Exact solutions are presented for two cases - rotary tidal current and sudden change of translatory current velocity."
"Simultaneous measurements were conducted in a wind-wave tank of the ripple slopes with an optical instrument and of the carrier-wave pro files with a wave-height gage. The experiments were conducted with steady winds of various velocities blowing over pre-existing regular surface waves. The data were analyzed to determine the slope distributions of ripples located on various portions of the carrier-wave profile. In the surface-tension governing regime of wind-wave interaction, the leeward face of the long wave was found to be much rougher than the windward face. The parasitic capillaries were concentrated on the upper half of the leeward face at a lower wind velocity, and moved downward at higher wind velocities. In the gravity governing regime, the difference in roughness between the leeward and the wind ward faces became smaller. However, the roughnesses on the leeward face were concentrated on the lower half of the wave profile."
"Particulate matter of the sizes, concentrations, and refractive indices found in situ renders the Optical Transfer Function of water a real quantity. Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) is measured in vitro by spatial filtering of the projected image of a slit in the Fourier Transform plane. Analysis is by Moire fringes with a smooth and continuous variation of spatial frequency (nominally 0-40,000 cycles/radian) obtained by counter-rotating Ronchi rulings. The analogue of convolution of impulse responses is tested as the cascadability in a scatter- ing medium of true sinusoidal MTF's. Coulter Counter techniques are used to measure differential particulate count in 15 channels up to 100 μm. Experimental data for various ranges and particle distributions are compared to theoretical predictions based on volume scattering functions (VSF) obtained by Mie scattering calculations and the Fourier transform conversion relating MTF and VSF first obtained by Willard Wells. The equipment is being repackaged for in-situ measurements to accompany forthcoming flood-illuminated SEGAIP (SELF GATED IN-WATER PHOTOGRAPHY) trials."
"A remote sensing unit has been developed to continuously monitor the benthic environment in selected kelp beds in the Santa Barbara Channel area. To characterize their environment, light distribution, temperature and water motion are monitored. Light distribution is determined by a six channel spectral irradiance photometer. Temperature is sensed using a thermistor in a linearizing constant voltage bridge over a range of 8 to 22 degrees Celsius with a resolution of 0.2°C. A capacitive transducer, immune to fouling by debris has been developed to supply wave height data. Bidirectional benthic surge currents are sensed by a silicon strain gauge bridge. The information is multiplexed at a sample rate of 250ms per channel, FM encoded and transmitted to shore about one kilometer along a line of sight. The system has been designed using low power circuitry enabling unattended operation for up to one month on standard 12 volt marine batteries."
"Of the many novel solar energy schemes being investigated in the United States, the Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Concept, OTEC, appears to be the one most likely to put the U.S. on the road towards energy self-sufficiency in the shortest possible time. The paper will illustrate how a solar sea power plant will convert the thermal energy stored in the tropical oceans into electricity. The main emphasis will be on capital plant cost and energy cost. Comparison with conventional nuclear plants will be made based on cost, energy pay-back and development time."
"Due to recent environmental legislation and growing scarcities of popular sea- foods, there is considerable interest in innovative systems that can strip nutrients biologically from waste water and produce potentially useful materials. While many variations of such systems exist, the systems described here are based on the secondary sewage-marine aquaculture system developed at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution with an option of using thermal effluent as a heat source. The design, performance and resulting costs of operational systems for commercial production scaled up by factors of ten,100 and 1,000 are projected and compared. The largest of these systems would be able to handle the waste water from a city of 100,000 people. Despite uncertainties in the systems, our analysis shows that large-scale systems using sewage as a nutrient source and free heat from power plant effluent (or located in a warm climate) could be profitable."
"As coordinator of the Inter-University Manganese Nodule Project, (1972 1975), the author presents a summary of the research results of many investigators. Details of individual re searches are given at the conference, but in deference to those investigators whose work is reported, only the expanded abstract of the presentation is given in published form."
"The ocean engineering projects course at the University of New Hampshire was begun in 1965-66 and has been funded since 1968-69 by the SEAGRANT Office of NOAA. It is the only academic year undergraduate education program sponsored by SEAGRANT. The projects course provides the undergraduate student with an educational experience that he would not normally receive in his academic program the experience of working as a member of an interdisciplinary team on a meaningful problem (ocean-related) under real-world constraints. Projects are of three basic types: those that lead to a piece of working hardware to solve a technological ocean problem, those that involve the gathering and analysis of biological and geological data, and those that are comprehensive studies of an ocean-oriented societal problem with recommendations for action. Under the guidance of a faculty adviser, each student team defines a problem, prepares and submits a budget, engages in dialogue with experts in the ocean community, makes progress reports, and writes a comprehensive final report. In addition, students on hardware-oriented projects deal with vendors and design, build and test prototype models, whereas students in non-hardware-oriented projects meet with local, state, and federal officials , do comprehensive library searches and often conduct appropriate surveys. In May, each project group makes an oral presentation and defense of its work, with visual aids, before a jury of experts drawn from the various sectors of the ocean community."
"A Monte Carlo approach is developed to study the characteristics of a propagating wave through a randomly inhomogeneous layer. An exact analysis of such problems is not generally available. Previous computer modelings have provided a partial solution, giving only the reflection and transmission coefficients. In contrast, the present simulation approach yields a complete wave solution throughout the nodes, P, of the layer. The technique adopts an efficient numerical procedure for the wave solution across each member of the ensemble, Q. Had a Gauss elimination been used, the increase by a factor, QP, in solution time would have been forbidding. Furthermore, the present implementation extends the simulation to physical circumstances not previously considered. It accounts for energy leakage near a vertexing ray. Also, it yields correct statistical descriptors of the wave field with the development of functional equations in stochastic variables, prior to the application of any averaging operation."
"The Civil Engineering Laboratory has developed a hand held diver operated rock drill. The drill is hydraulically powered thus eliminating the percussion and visibility problems associated wi th the underwater use of pneumatic rock drills. Capable of drilling holes up to 2-1/2 inches in diameter and 18 inches deep, the hydraulic rock drill has been used to install various seafloor fasteners and to provide shot holes for small explosive charges. Underwater testing of commercially available rock bolts produced data which can be used for the design of boat moorings and immobilization of undersea cables and pipelines in various types of seafloor rock. This paper discusses the development and testing of the prototype drill as well as the results of extensive testing of seafloor fasteners."
"Divers In cold water require supplemental heat to function effectively for extended periods. Described is the design, fabrication and testing of a self-contained diver-worn heater that supplies hot water to closed circuit thermal protection suits. Heat is produced by the electrochemical reaction of magnesium in seawater. The reaction is accelerated by shorting the magnesium anode to an iron cathode. Up to two kilowatts for eight hours endurance have been produced. Characteristics of the reaction are discussed. A test of a one kilowatt eight hour heater with a diver immersed in 2°C water confirmed that the magnesium reaction Is a feasible means of supplying heat."
"In May 1974, personnel from the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University of Newfoundland, conducted a shallow air saturation dive under the ice at Resolute, N.W.T. This dive was an extension of activity currently being conducted at the L.O.R.A. - I habitat in Newfoundland, and was made in conjunction with the Maclnnis Foundation Arctic IV Expedition. This paper briefly describes the dive objectives, procedures and accomplishments and makes recommendations concerning the feasibility of future application of similar techniques to support shallow commercial and scientific programs in the Arctic."
"The purpose of this paper will be to re view the progress and preliminary results of a NSF/RANN funded study on management in resource zones. The main parts of the study are as follows: (1) Scope of Problem. A substantive analysis of the scope of the management problems involved in 200 mile fishing zones. (2) History of Fishing and Geographical Effects of Zone. A brief history of the biological and economic aspects of exploitation in the study area and a simple geographical analysis of how a 200 mile zone will re distribute management potential. (3) National Management Problems. An analysis of possible regulatory procedures open to the U. S. for managing stocks that will be under its exclusive control. Variables under study will be efficiency of harvest, total and regional employment effects, potential for license revenues, the combination of national and foreign fishing power used, including the potential and desirability of a 100% American fleet, balance of payment effects, etc."
"A study was undertaken to develop the concept of utilizing marine space for the deployment of an electric power plant. The analysis developed suggests that a floating coal-fired power plant in a semi-submersible hull is technically and economically feasible. Technical considerations indicate that the system should be composed of three 50MW electric generating units modified with marine boilers. This system would be deployable within existing technology. Economic feasibility indicated: capital costs of 3.6 mills/KWH; other fixed costs of 1.3 mills/KWH; operating costs of 2 mills/KWH and fuel costs between 4.6 and 7.6 mills/KWH. Initial studies concluded that coal could be a less expensive fuel than oil given: (1) high-productivity, low-cost, large-scale mining of Western or Alaskan coal, and (2) efficient overland coal transportation. When the social and environmental benefits of locating the power plant offshore are considered, the floating power plant appears distinctly superior."
"A multidisciplinary feasibility study involving extensive interaction with regulatory agencies and environmental groups has shown that the proposed use of about one million cubic yards of unpolluted dredged sediment from a small boat basin to build a 90 to 100 acre island-like wildlife reserve and associated salt marsh would be environmentally beneficial, compatible with existing local multiple land/water use, and is feasible from an engineering point of view. Using hydraulic dredging and confined disposal, the project would cost about $1.5 million. The study and the proposed project together constitute a practical example of effective coastal zone multiple use planning and management in a state with rigorous coastal zone laws."
"Large numbers of boats in estuarine water bodies of limited size and depth may cause undesireable overcrowding, adverse environmental effects, or both. The results of the first phase of a two phase research and management planning study of recreational boating in Chesapeake and Chincotea gue Bays* have identified the structural and operational characteristics of boating activities and facility construction which, from the reviewed literature, are acknowledged to affect boat-user satisfaction or sensitive environmental indicators. Although biological carrying capacity de terminations appear to remain problematic and less preferable than control of pollution causative factors at the source, estimations of boating user satisfaction carrying capacity are more easily achievable. An 11 step capacity planning system has been formulated as a result."
"A general interdisciplinary model of the North Sea is presented. The model, which integrates the contributions of many neighbouring countries under the coordination of the Joint North Sea Modelling Group, feeds a hierarchy of submodels. These models, progressing from the description of transient and residual circulations to the dynamics of coastal ecosystems and the translocation of pollutants through the food chain, provide the material for continental seas and coastal management. Detailed results concerning the Southern Bight of the Morth Sea and the Belgian Coastal waters are given in illustration."
"The upper limit of environmental elements is questioned by reports of increasing extremes of winds, waves, storm tides and currents in old and new areas of offshore development. During stormy seasons in hostile areas like the North Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the North Atlantic, extreme values of such parameters have been underestimated. Semi-permanent offshore operations in these areas indicate extreme conditions increase with exposure time. Is the increase of extremes related to changing climate or to avail ability of more data? If we cannot separate the causes of underestimates, we can update the empirical data, discuss their implications and present these for consideration. The ultimate maxima are theoretically computed and considered. Climatic changes contributing to storm intensity at world locations are presented and their implications discussed."
"The Navy will soon see a new component in its electronic systems that will have significant impact on electronic systems performance, design, and availability. This is the microcomputer, a small computer developed out of a few large-scale-integrated (LSI) circuits. This paper will explore potential applications, technology trends, and problems that may occur. Among the applications discussed are performance system monitoring, propulsion control, damage control, and combat direction system design. Procurement problems including standardization, software and hardware proliferation, maintenance and training philosophy, and future applications areas are reviewed. CONCLUSION: This paper points the way to the use of micro-computers for Navy shipboard applications and the problems that may arise. There has not been any other paper aimed at this area."
"This paper presents the convincing arguments for going with on-board environmental data platform-satellite communications following three years of successful data acquisition using HF data link. In addition, the rationale for the selection of the Geostationary Orbiting Environmental Satellite (GOES) System approach to hardware procurement and implementation on-board environmental data buoys is also given. Finally, the paper will provide a wide expanse of data results indicating percentage communication successes from various geographical buoy locations."
"Near bottom moored transponders are being used for precision navigation in the deep ocean. To use these navigation systems the relative positions of the transponders must be determined. Typically, a ship surveys the transponders by making slant range measurements from a series of survey points; the positions of the transponders are then estimated using standard nonlinear least square methods. In this paper we use some ideas from the design of nonlinear experiments to find survey patterns that can improve the estimates of the transponder positions. We will analyze the standard three transponder geometry. Our methods show that the accuracy of the least squares estimation procedure is very sensitive to the survey geometry. Careful design of the survey pattern can increase the accuracy of the survey by a factor of five to ten."
"The Navy is developing a deep-ocean work system comprised of manipulators and a variety of hydraulic tools integrated to accomplish meaning ful work tasks to ocean depths of 20,000 ft. The system can be readily adapted to the manned submersibles ALVIN, SEACLIFF, and TURTLE, and the robot vehicles CURV III and RUWS, to .extend their work capability. In addition, it can be positioned and controlled by divers or operated by itself from a surface support ship. The system was designed to perform a complete work operation on the sea floor without the necessity of resurfacing for tool interchange. Potential tasks include recovery, construction, installation, and repair operations. Low-light level TV cameras, with quartz-iodide flood lights, augment the vehicle operator's vision for tool exchange and work operations."
"Two distinct acoustic methods are used to provide precise navigation at sea over areas of approximately 100 km2. Both methods position via acoustic transmission from a set of moored transponders or beacons. When the elements of the reference net are operated in a transpond mode the system is called a pulse positioning system; when operated in a continuous mode the system is known as a Doppler system. A combined navigation scheme 'which capitalizes on the attributes of both the pulse and Doppler modes is under development. It will be capable ultimately of positioning a platform with respect to the reference net with an error of 1 to 2 meters, and of repositioning a platform within 10 cm of a previous fix in 5 km depth water. In this paper we present a performance analysis of the pulse-Doppler system in which we consider the the characteristics of the system receivers in detecting pulse and Doppler information. Factors affecting performance such as signal level, receiver bandwidth, ambient sea noise and platform motion are discussed. Comparisons are made between optimum and typical performance."
"The sinking of the Litton launching platform while undocking the USS SPRUANCE (DD 963) jeopardized the lngalls Division's entire shipbuilding program. Under the direction of the U.S. Navy Supervisor of Salvage, an intensive salvage operation was successfully conducted to raise the platform as expediently as possible for subsequent restoration and return to use. The structural limitations of the dock and hydrostatics of the situation presented the salvors with a unique and formidable challenge which was ultimately to be overcome by an innovative salvage technique employing simultaneous pumping and blowing with air."
"This paper presents the results of a study that examined predictive models for predicting dispersion and plume formation from a dredging operation; a field measurements program to collect sufficient data on an actual sand mining operation to quantitatively describe the turbidity plume, and compares predictions made by the model to the field measurements. The predictions demonstrated that the agreement between the model and the field data is acceptable until the time that the plume shape is incorrectly predicted. A further limitation of the model was its inability to handle a time-variable water current field. The data clearly shows that, for a surface discharge of overflow water, the cloud initially is dispersed throughout the water column but very quickly stabilizes into a surface layer only a few feet deep, that persists for a long time."
"In an abrupt political turn westward, President Anwar el Sadat of the Arab Republic of Egypt, accepted the offer of the United States Government to assist in reopening the Suez Canal closed since 1967. The task of clearing the ten blockading wrecks was assigned by the U.S. Navy to the Murphy Pacific Marine Salvage Company. Pitting its preeminent expertise in the field of marine salvage against a background of conducting operations 6,000 miles distant in a war ravaged zone, the firm by judicious planning, scheduling and supervision cleared the Suez Canal of the ten wrecks ahead of schedule, within budget and without a single serious casualty."
"The acquisition of useful data taken over the ocean from space through remote sensing was initially explored in detail during 1964. Oceanographic requirements, the space system and satellite orbit required, atmospheric interactions, atmospheric windows, the sensors, data handling, and a space-oceanographic experimental program are discussed in this paper. Complementary oceanographic cruising for the data acquired from the space platform is also related."
"For structures in the deep ocean, a new set of criteria are required for design and construction. Planning for such deep ocean structures is now necessary, particularly for prospective utilization as anchor blocks for the mooring of ocean thermal energy plants. The technology is also applicable to seafloor production and storage of oil and to certain proposed deep sea mining facilities. This paper presents an evaluation of design criteria, along with a proposed system for design, construction, and installation of a deep sea anchor block."
"We have constructed an experimental underwater acoustic holographic system that uses 100 piezoelectric transducers in a linear receiving array with the object area insonified by a single cylindrical acoustic radiator. The receiving array is swept through the water synchronously with a linear array of 100 light-emitting diodes positioned above the water. The holographic data is parallel-processed in 100 electronic channels, each driving its respective light-emitting diode during the sweep. A time-exposed photograph of the optical pattern thereby created is processed and used as an optical hologram. Many holograms have been made with the system in a laboratory tank. The reconstructed images demonstrate that the resolution attained is of the order of a few wavelengths. The principal practical problems were cross-talk between channels and tolerance of components. If the scanning of a larger system is carried out by the passage of a ship through the water, rapid surveying of the ocean floor becomes a possibility."
"The mounting economic pressure to extract oil and other resources from the Continental Shelf and to continue using it for waste disposal is creating a need for cost-effective, synoptic means of determining currents in this area. An integrated satellite-aircraft-drogue approach has been developed which employs remotely tracked expendable drogues together with satellite observations of waste plumes and natural tracers, such as suspended sediment. Tests conducted on the Continental Shelf and in Delaware Bay indicate that the system provides a cost-effective means of monitoring current circulation and ocean waste dispersion even under severe environmental conditions."
"The purpose of this paper is to aid mission planners and design engineers in choosing the best available power system to satisfy the power requirements for a particular mission. It provides an overview of electric power supplies suitable for remote applications. Particularly, emphasis is placed on power supplies for missions requiring low average power and long life. Included are radioisotope power generators, sealed chemical batteries, seawater batteries, transmission cables, fuel cells , gas-fired thermoelectric generators , solar batteries and wind generators. This data will permit the user to quickly identify the power system, in the existing inventory, which will satisfy the minimum mission requirements or that which can be most economically modified to meet these requirements. In addition, the power supply category which best lends itself to the design and development of a new power system in easily identified."
"The purpose of this report is to demonstrate the feasibility of using ERTS-1 satellite data as a means of monitoring and detecting oil spills on oceanic and estuarian waters. Three reported spills were investigated using four analysis methods on ERTS-1 digital data. The results indicate that any of these methods might be usable, if the spill were large enough to be seen by satellite, if the spill occurs more than a few kilometers off-shore, and if the sky and water are relatively clear. In one case, detection was accomplished but identification of material was not possible, and in the other two cases, the spills could not be detected at all. ERTS-1 was not considered feasible for operational oil-pollution monitoring because of its 18 day overpass frequency, the few spectral channels, the extended bandwidths, and the long information retrieval time. Monitoring and detection of oil spills could involve a satellite, if these drawbacks were corrected."
"Alternative techniques for cable installation across rock nearshore zones are introduced. (The nearshore zone is variously defined as extending from the beach to water depths between 30 and 200 m.) The alternative techniques are made possible by new equipment developments in directional drilling of oil wells and in rock trenching. First, it is feasible and sometimes economical to directionally drill a borehole from the beach to emerge from the seafloor some 4 000 m offshore. This report describes the techniques available to drill, case, and install cable in such a drill hole. Second, it is feasible and economical to cut a trench in soft rock (coral) to medium hard rock (shale, sandstone) using a bottom crawling, modified terrestrial trencher. The equipment modifications necessary are described."
"This paper offers an investigation of the technical and economic feasibility of using standard utility-grade coal burning equipment and electrical generation equipment in an offshore installation. An investigation of design parameters including siting, configuration, use of conventional power equipment, undersea power cables, fuel transport, construction, and environmental impact has been made. Three possible configurations and an economic comparison between a barge type floating power plant and a land plant are given. The conclusion is that an offshore plant is technically feasible, is economically comparable to a land plant, and offers greater environmental benefits. This paper is a summary of a report sponsored in part by the NOAA Office of Sea Grant."
"A review of recent developments in the construction of floating breakwaters is presented. Construction techniques and materials are examined and their field performance to date is assessed. Some data on the effectiveness of each of the breakwaters and their cost is also included for comparison."
"The U.S. Oceanographic Research Fleet includes three sectors, the Federal, academic and commercial and comprises about 150 ships (over 25 meters LOA) about evenly divided between the three sectors. The estimated cost of this fleet in 1975 is about $86.OM of which $71M represents Federal ship support in total Federal marine oriented programs of $559M. Size of this fleet is static or under going reductions owing to increased operating costs or retirement without replacement. About 20% of the fleet is approaching obsolescence. Projections of future (5 year) ship needs for Federal programs indicate about a 20% increase over current levels. There presently are three replacement ships under construction for the academic sector but no other approved Federal shipbuilding plans. On a worldwide comparison of a total of about 730 research ships, the USSR operates about 194 and Japan 94."
"The paper describes a unique floating breakwater under joint development by California and the Navy. The transportability of the system makes it applicable for temporary protection of offshore construction projects, as well as for a number of permanent installations where conventional breakwaters are not feasible. The results of the development program are described, including the successful demonstration of a limited fetch breakwater in San Diego Bay. Plans for an ocean scale experiment during the next year are outlined. Recommendations are presented for the commercial development of the system to meet national needs-both commercial and military."
"Power, up to 2.5 kw, can be produced utilizing the thermal differences between the ocean and the crude oil. This power source is designed to operate, monitor and control systems at individual wellheads. Communication with a master control center is accomplished acoustically thereby eliminating the need for subsea electrical cables and connectors. The concept was analyzed using established relationships for heat transfer, scale deposits, and thermal conductivity. A computer program performed the iterative computations required. The system has shown to be technically feasible. Actual application would require a specific analysis for the situation considered including an economic evaluation which was not performed as a part of this study."
"A detailed knowledge of sea-surface thermal patterns in near real-time would provide west coast fishermen with the means to locate areas favorable for catching albacore and salmon. This information can be provided through the use of infrared imagery presently available from NOAA's ITOS series satellite, NOAA-3. These infrared data can be enhanced to display sea-surface thermal fronts when present. Frontal contours can then be projected onto standard navigation charts and the results transmitted to the fleet. The 1975 fishing season has been chosen as a trial period to test this approach. Feedback from the user community will be necessary to refine and improve these procedures."
"Remotely sensed data collected from the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS-1) are capable of providing synoptic, large area, repetitive coverage of oceanographic parameters at high resolution. Photointerpretation techniques and digital analysis of ERTS-1 multispectral imagery has permitted: (1) accurate depth detection (± 0.25 meters) for depths to 9 meters; (2) updating of navigational charts depicting previously unreported shoals and accurate positioning of previously reported shoals at costs of only $.58 per square kilometer; (3) correlation of schools of menhaden within certain turbidity areas; (4) discovery of new upwelling areas; (5) detection and monitoring of sea ice, determination of its relative age, and iceberg tracking; (6) monitoring and detection of oil spills, acid and sludge dump sites; (7) current mapping; (8) wetlands delineation; and (9) coastal erosion and sedimentation at significant savings of time and cost."
"Seasat-A is a new NASA satellite dedicated to oceanographic measurements of interest to a broad spectrum of the marine community. Its strong suit is an array of active and passive microwave instruments that give it the ability to view surface features on a day-night, near all-weather basis. It will measure such features as wave heights, lengths, and directions; surface wind velocities; currents; temperatures; ice cover; and the marine geoid. Sensor capabilities and examples of their data output will be given, and the usefulness of these data for understanding the coastal marine environment will be discussed."
"A real-aperture radar technique is under development at the Goddard Space Flight Center to remotely sense ocean gravity waves from spacecraft. Experimental data obtained from aircraft demonstrations indicate correlation between wave profilometer and radar-derived spectra, and results from an analytical model for scattering from rough surfaces shows promise of explaining the sensor response. This paper will present the basic concept of the sensing system and a summary of the research program and results."
"Bucket experiments were conducted to measure the rate of diffusion of oxygen into sea water, stripped of dissolved oxygen to about 1 mg/l, of \"homogeneous\" salinity of 26-300/00 and with a \"stable\" temperature gradient. In five successive tests, the water required about 60 hours, under calm laboratory conditions, to exceed 7 mg/l at all depths in the bucket. Results of these tests indicated input of oxygen to be much more rapid than expected from molecular diffusion of the Fickian type giving a diffusion coefficient of 6 × 10-3 cm2 sec-1 compared to 2 × 10-5 cm2 sec-1. It is suggested that evaporation in the thin water layer at the air/water boundary increases the salinity sufficiently to initiate the transfer of oxygen from the atmosphere into sea water by convective movements, even in the presence of a stable temperature gradient and in the absence of turbulence."
"The author reviews the development of submersibles and past efforts to provide for their location and recovery when entrapped. Both equipment and organizational systems are discussed. The roles of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard are covered. A survey of existing and planned recovery devices is presented. A comparison of manned submersibles, divers, and remote systems is made for various rescue scenarios. The author presents his views on the optimum approach for a future underwater SAR regime, outlining the roles of the individual operator and government."
"The technology transfer process is very complex and difficult, especially where secondary uses of innovations (\"spinoffs\") are involved. Six diverse cases of transfer of aerospace technology to civil land and sea transportation systems were examined. The case of liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker development is presented to illustrate major factors which play an influential role in the process. Key \"promotors\" are people, financial support, demanding performance specifications or design criteria, identified need and conscious at tempts to change. Recurring \"inhibitors\" are economics, environment, inertia, and institutions. Most of these key factors in the technology transfer process were common to all six cases, suggesting possible campaign tactics for future efforts to transfer technology successfully."
"To fulfill the needs of geologists and geophysicits involved in the FAMOUS project, French submersibles, ARCHIMEDE and CYANA have been adapted for this particular mission and equipped with a deep ocean navigation system, A transponders net is moored on the ocean bottom, calibrated and oriented ; this net is then located in geographical coordinates. A 3 transponder net is enough for an area of 20 square kilometers. Processing of data can be made by hand or computer. An accuracy of ten meters was obtained although the sea bottom was rough and rugged. The transponders can be released and moored again as the work area is moving."
"Design construction parameters including location for a proposed sewer outfall off Chambers Creek, Puget Sound, Washington were developed by the staff of Northwest Consultant Oceanographers Inc. Applying techniques and computations developed for similar projects, basic working assumptions were developed. These were then tested against a scaled physical model and modified as required. Finally, all assumptions and modifications were evaluated against an on-site field observation project. Currents at various levels were measured by drogues and current meters, one of which was a unique bottom-mounted instrument. Strong current shear at the proposed site assures strong turbulence and mixing. The receiving waters off Chambers Creek are well-able to assimilate both the proposed initial and future effluent loading."
"The University of Wisconsin-Madison has been using airborne remote sensing techniques to study the surface details of strong nearshore currents in the Great Lakes for the last five years. Aerial photogrammetry and infrared thermal line scanning are the principal tools, although both common radiation thermometers and satellite thermal imagery are also used. \"Ground truth\" measurements of surface temperature, currents, and water level fluctuations are usually made. The method could equally well be used to study strong coastal currents in the ocean."
"A bottom-mounted deep current measuring system has been developed at the Naval Air Development Center. The system provides long-term, near-bottom current data which is being used to study both the nature and movement of large scale eddies in the near-bottom ocean and the effect of local topographical features on near-bottom currents. The system, termed the ROBOTS CURSOR (Remote, On-the Bottom, Over-the-Side, Current Sensor), employs up to four recording current meters suspended by a single cable at selectable distances from the ocean bottom. Current data can be recorded for periods up to 30 days. Buoyancy is provided by a framework of 41 cm (16 inch) diameter glass spheres. Location of the deployed ROBOTS and its release are accomplished using a pair of acoustic release/transponders arranged in parallel. ROBOTS has been successfully deployed and recovered in the deep ocean at the eastern end of the Puerto Rico trench. Current and temperature data measured 15 to 50 meters from the bottom in depths to 3000 meters are presented. Current speeds varied from zero to 9 cm/sec/ (0 to 0.18 kn) with direction spanning 360 degrees."
"The Data Buoy Office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) deployed two 12m diameter discus buoys in the deep ocean in early December 1974. This paper presents a description of the wave measurement hardware and software used on-board the two buoys, and the additional data processing performed on shore. The at-sea comparison tests performed to validate the data are analyzed and results shown. The dissemination of the wave data in the operational mode is described as well as some of the problems encountered in making the system work properly. Future plans for wave measurements based upon what has been learned from these experimental platforms are also presented."
"As national concern has increased over the gap between domestic energy supply and demand, private interests and federal and state governments have been actively involved in discussions aimed at determining how energy supplies can be increased without causing severe negative environmental and socio-economic impacts. A focus of attentions is on the coastal zone where much energy related activity is expected to take place. This paper discusses some of the major issues, how these issues relate to coastal zone management, and possible solution to resolving some of the existing concerns and conflicts."
"The study included one and one-half years of botanical work (nursery, laboratory, and field) focused upon the development of baseline information on environmental parameters affecting growth and survival of intertidal flora (Spartina foliosa and Salicornia ssp.) and the formulation and testing of procedures for the efficient artificial propagation of this flora. The planting and monitoring of replicate test plots in an unconfined area has affirmed that dredged material is a suitable substrate for intertidal vegetation. In addition, the study monitored the progress of an intertidal substrate construction project in San Francisco Bay. This construction included hydraulic dredging with disposal in a 110-acre confined area for the combined purposes of dredge material disposal and the creation of a substrate suitable for the propagation of marsh-land plants. Study observations to date indicate that within practical limits an appropriate marsh topography can be established with available equipment and existing dredging technology. Results of this study will be used in planning for the establishment of marshes on this material."
"United States technology is increasingly viewed as providing the backbone and where-withal to arrest the nation's economic slide and to restore the accustomed U. S. leadership position in international trade. This view stems from demonstrated U. a preeminence in technology, the importance of technology in economic growth, and the ascendancy of technology in foreign affairs and international trade today. But, undue preoccupation with the domestic technology base represents at best a suboptimum strategy in the face of a continuing decline in the national investment in R&D. In view of the incipient shifting of the world technological balance overseas, comparable attention needs to be focused on foreign technological developments, and their potential for import and adaptation to help fuel technological innovation at home. A more balanced mix of foreign and domestic technological ingredients in the U. S. socioeconomic cauldron promises to be more attuned to the reality of scarce domestic resources and the changing world environment."
"Summary form only given. Certain types of diving can be carried, out safely on an ad hoc basis, but outer continental shelf depths demand a new order of control and instrumentation. Λs the complexity of diving operations increases, the demand for accurate record keeping becomes greater. Typically, this job has been the responsibility of the ciiving supervisor. Reports are often left until the end of an operation, at which time, the supervisor may go to the appropriate decompression regime and fill in the steps, relying on his memory to log events that occurred during the dive."
"Experimentation with rubber cable tethered buoys, originally used to reduce the watch circle of navigation buoys, has led to a unique wave measuring system. A tensiometer and two angle measurement transducers added to the anchor end of the rubber cable allows measurement of the cable tension and the angle of the cable with the vertical. For small fractional change in length, the cable exhibits a linear displacement-tension characteristic. The system thus allows an indirect measurement of the vertical buoy displacement. The two dimensional computer model consists of a coupled pair of non-linear differential equations formed by summing the component vertical and horizontal forces to the virtual mass times component accelerations. The equations are coupled through the tether force and are non-linear in the drag and buoyant force terms. The driving function for the model is a traveling sinusoidal wave which affects the buoyant force and the drag forces through the orbital water particle velocity. The equations are solved numerically and all component forces, displacements, velocities, and accelerations are available as outputs. The mathematical model of the system predicts that the buoy is a wave follower as long as the buoyant force is predominant over the tether and drag forces."
"Following detonation of an underwater explosion, sound reverberates from the ocean surface and bottom and from scatterers within the medium. In addition, the boundaries of the ocean basin and obstructions within it, such as sea mounts, reradiate the acoustic energy incident upon them. Our concern is with these latter signals. This paper describes a computer reverberation model being developed to predict the sound level that will ensue following detonation of a large underwater explosion. As we have developed the model, we have made comparisons with existing experimental data and theories concerning the reflection of sound in the ocean. A simplistic model has proved adequate for matching available experimental measurements in the North Atlantic Basin. Since the parameters on which the model is based are simply defined and applicable to any geometrical configuration, the computations are expected to apply to other ocean basins as well."
"This paper describes general capability and typical uses of a new computer system developed for calculation of the non-linear quasi-hydrostatic reactions of complex hulls, columns, braces, etc. typically used in the design of semisubmersibles, pipe-lay stingers and other marine configurations."
"A new technique for determining the search area for maritime search and rescue operations is presented. This technique, which is based on a statistical description of the uncertainties in determining the drift track of a life raft, offers significant improvement over current, deterministic techniques. Two examples of hypo-thetical search situations are also given."
"An equation for evaluating momentum flux from wind to waves is presented. The presence of an acoustic pressure wave and of water wave reflection in wind-wave facilities is shown to lead to incorrect data regarding momentum transfer."
"Summary form only given. The commercial diving companies have been following the oil companies to greater and greater depths in the exploration for new oil deposits. During the first half of the 1970's, this has meant that divers, instead of working the 150to 500-fsw range in systems designed for 600-fsw operation, are now expected to work in depths from 500 to 1500 fsw. Divers' equipment and techniques have barely managed to keep pace with the requirements of the deeper depths, but the move towards deeper water has created new problems for the designers of chamber systems. Diving beyond 600 fsw requires the use of sophisticated communications, gas analysis, and environmental monitoring and control systems. The requirements placed on the instrumentation have reached a point where the instruments used in the field must equal the quality of those used in hyperbaric laboratories. In depths of this magnitude the tolerable physiological range of oxygen in the divers breathing mixture is less than the degree of error exhibited by some analyzers. The chamber temperature must be accurately controlled, as even a degree variation in the temperature can cause the divers discomfort. Those problems and the others caused by the in- crease in depth capability have been at- tacked in a piecemeal fashion, though interim solutions have been achieved in most cases. The problem has now become one of how to integrate the systems to provide the maximum in diver safety and comfort, while also maintaining or increasing the efficiency and ease of operation. Tarrytown Labs, has approached the design of a Control Van for 1000-fsw chamber operation as an opportunity to put recent advances in instrumentation and computers to work for the diving industry. The Control Van uses a computer to monitor chamber environmental parameters, fill out the dive log, and provide the de- compression profiles. Computer control is also extended to the decompression con- troller to allow the use of fewer topside personnel, while increasing the precision with which the decompression profile is followed."
"Equipment selection for bathymetric and sub-bottom profiling applications requires a performance prediction for alternative system configurations. Performance prediction uses the standard sonar equation modified for bathymetric system configurations. The term of the prediction equation that has caused considerable discussion is the transmission loss. A discussion of two transmission loss models is presented. Parametric analyses of the equivalence of the two models are made for bottom slope, transducer beam pattern, and pulse length."
"Florida recently required coastal construction setback lines along its sand beaches fronting the ocean and Gulf. The Coastal Laboratory, University of Florida, has a research contract to provide the technical information and make recommendations for establishment of the setback lines. The study included historical research related to shoreline stability, field measurements and analytical evaluation. Factors considered were upland topography, vegetation, bathymetry, shoreline stability (erosion trends), storm surges, wave setup and uprush, dune/beach erosion due to storms, existing coastal structures, beach nourishment and upland development. Analysis of the pertinent factors resulted in formulation of criteria that were applied in establishment of the setback lines. Management of beach development is possible utilizing engineering/scientific investigation however the study pointed to areas of much needed research in the Coastal Zone."
"Several remotely manned undersea vehicles have been designed, constructed, and tested at the Naval Undersea Center. Two of these, Electric Snoopy and NAVFAC Snoopy, have been designed primarily for undersea inspection, surveillance, and recovery tasks to depths of 1,500 feet. NAVFAC Snoopy incorporates circuitry to automatically maintain vehicle heading as well as depth or altitude, and a multiplexing system which allows transmission of power, control signals, and data signals on a single small diameter coaxial tether cable. Uses of Electric Snoopy have included inspection and color documentation of coral beds, sunken ships, and fish spawning areas. Potential rescue and recovery capabilities have also been demonstrated by using a mechanical grabber and line reel attached to the vehicle."
"A drill has been developed that utilizes thermal energy in the form of heated water to melt a groove by convective heat transfer in thick sea ice. The system components are described, as well as the techniques involved in cold-starting the system at ambient temperatures down to -35°C. The five operational units that have been constructed are also described and some of the field operations are discussed, including the drilling of a hydrohole 1.2 m by 3.7 m through sea ice about 8.5 m thick at Ice Island T-3. Comparable holes of various sizes and shapes can be made with suitably-designed cutting heads and multiple melts."
"NDBO is sponsoring a data buoy program to meet the requirements of the National Weather Service (NWS) for environmental monitoring in data sparse marine areas. Initially, six buoys are planned for deployment in the Gulf of Alaska and along the west coast of the United States to provide data to NWS and other organizations involved in making weather forecasts and climatological studies. The buoys will be a deep discuss hull configuration with a diameter of 10 meters. Meteorological, oceanographic, and wave parameters will be measured and reported to shore for dissemination to users. The low-power demand, modular-electronics payload will be powered by a 3-year supply of air-depolarized batteries. The payload consists of redundant meteorological sensor assemblies to measure wind speed and direction, barometric pressure, and air temperature; thermistors to measure water temperature at seven levels; a hard wired data acquisition and control system; and two, two-channel HF communication systems. Although the initial communications mode will be HF, provisions have been made for conversion to UHF when the Geo stationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) becomes operational. The first buoy is now deployed off the coast of Oregon. Five additional buoys are presently in production and will be delivered in June 1976."
"The Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR) on board the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operational polar orbiting satellites has enabled the National Environmental Satellite Service (NESS) to operationally support oceanographic interest to a greater degree than ever before. The two channel (.6 .7 μm and 10.5 - 12.5 μm) radiometer with a subpoint resolution of 1 km allows for greater detail of measurement of several oceanographic phenomenon. In addition to the polar orbiters NOAA/NESS operates two geostationary satellites each equipped with a Visible Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (VISSR). This two channel instrument (.55 - .75 μm and 10.5 - 12.6 μm) has opened up the exciting possibility of observing motion of the surface thermal features of the ocean."
"The multiplex system described was designed for use on the NAVFAC Snoopy vehicle, a small remotely manned tethered undersea vehicle developed at the Naval Undersea Center. Using a combination of time division (TDM) and frequency multiplexing, the system allows simultaneous transmission of vehicle power, status, command, and video signals over a small diameter coaxial cable. Digital vehicle and status signals are TDM encoded, frequency modulated, and then transmitted via the tether cable to the vehicle (or control station) receiver. At the receiver the signals are frequency demodulated, TDM de coded, and sent to the appropriate function. The power and video signals are simply frequency multiplexed onto the tether cable, along with the frequency modulated command and status signals."
"Techniques have been developed whereby it is relatively easy to acquire data on currents in submarine canyons. Savonius rotor current meters, explosive releases, and a free-fall system are utilized. The equipment, its deployment, and general conditions and problems are discussed, along with a brief description of analytical techniques."
"This paper discusses the requirements of navigation equipment for deep ocean mining. The presentation includes the positional accuracy desired, together with the rationale for establishing these requirements. In order to develop an appreciation of the problem, the environment in which the mining is to take place is descibed and some of the specific equipments and related operational characteristics are identified. Positioning requirements are twofold in that positions of both the surface vessel and the bottom dredge must be established. Required positional accuracy is influenced by such factors as terrain variability, size and frequency of obstructions, survival capabilities of equipments and desired dredge path efficiency. This paper covers test and exploration phases with some extension into the commercial mining phase."
"It is predicted that by 1980 there will be some 150 steel platforms and over 50 concrete platforms permanently installed in the North Sea to serve the oil industry. Nearly all of these structures will be in water deeper than 30 meters, with some at 250-300 meters. In addition some 4000 kilometers of sub-sea pipeline are projected to be in service. Underwater inspection is a requirement for these structures so that the risks of failure is minimized over their long-term operational life. This paper describes the work in progress by Det norske Veritas in underwater inspection. The \"why\" and \"how\" of under-water inspection in the North Sea are discussed and the results of recent experiences are presented. The paper places emphasis on the unique nature of underwater inspection problems with the desire to communicate these problems to other specialists. A main point made in the paper is that the state of the technology is young and that considerable potential and incentive exists for advancing this technology."
"To meet the requirements of a wide range of electrical loads, the NOAA Data Buoy Office has developed and operated reliable power systems. Diesel electric generators and battery-powered systems, including hybrid batteries, have been de ployed from the Tropics to the Arctic. The performance of these power systems is presented in narrative form. Other power systems that are being developed or tested are described. Solar cells have been tested at sea and show promise as a replacement for the batteries. A fuel cell with a calcium hydride hydrogen source is under development and sea water batteries are undergoing test and evaluation. Considerations in the use of wind-powered generators, a wave-activated turbine generator, and radioactive power generator units are discussed."
"An up-to-date look at the problems associated with ocean instrumentation. Many of the past reports and recommendations on the subject are cited and related progress is discussed. There is concern over too much rhetoric. A key point is lack of quantitative information for program managers to adequately analyze cost effectiveness. Insufficient failure reporting and quality assurance are major deficiencies. The need for a better focus on instrument development is also addressed. A band of performance requirements and up-to-date national inventory data are presented. The promise comes from increased measurement requirements resulting from emphasis on coastal zone and environmental concerns which the authors believe will force favorable change."
"Variations in the environmental parameters of the ocean cause amplitude and phase fluctuations to be introduced to an acoustic signal propagating in the ocean. To be able to completely under stand the nature of these fluctuations, it is necessary to have the capability to sample the environmental parameters of the medium as a function of depth at selected points along the propagation path. To meet this latter requirement, the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has developed a low-cost environmental sampling device which can measure and record selected environmental parameters in the upper portion of the water column."
"Needs, diving system limitations and pressure related technical problems are considered in an examination of deep ocean metals joining technology. Methods will soon be needed to repair structures at depths exceeding 300 meters but existing arc welding processes are limited in depth by pressure effects acting both on the diver and on the arc. Joining devices being developed for salvage operations are not constrained by diving considerations but are not adequate for most repair and construction work. New processes suitable for remote operation yet versatile enough for practical application are needed."
"This paper presents a general framework for the management of natural resources. Specific illustrations are drawn from ocean solid minerals. It is also the aim of this paper to show that certain systems analysis techniques are useful in resources management."
"Recent work has indicated that the common-depth-point method of seismic exploration may be scaled to obtain high quality estimates of compressional wave velocity in unconsolidated seafloor sediments. In this paper, a computer-aided analysis technique implemented to extract these velocity functions is described and its application illustrated. The objective sought in developing this analysis technique was to provide the capability of extracting independent velocity estimates from routinely obtained normal and oblique high resolution reflection data."
"Increased knowledge about ocean bottom sediments is being sought for many purposes. A free-fall terrestrial penetrometer developed by Sandia Laboratories over the past 14 years is being adapted as a low-cost system to gather such in situ information as sediment shear strength, pore water pressures, densities, heat flow, soil types, penetrability, acoustic proper ties, etc. Either a hard wire or an acoustic data transmission link connects the instrumentation in the buried penetrometer to a surface recording/telemetry unit. Earlier versions of this system have successfully penetrated to depths up to 16.4 feet (5 m) in Gulf of Mexico sediments."
"The need for an iceworthy research ship to meet the research requirements of the Alaskan Arctic Region has recently been highlighted by Elsner (1)* and documented by Dinsmore (2). Recommendations to acquire such a vessel in the immediate future have been made. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of recent icebreaking model experiments which have characterized the behavior of an oceanographic research ship hull form in ice covered waters."
"The Profiling Oceanographic Sensor measures the temperature profile in the upper 300m of the water column. The sensor body, containing a platinum resistance thermometer, strain gage pressure transducer and associated signal conditioning circuitry, free-falls from the sea surface at a near constant rate until reaching the maximum sensing depth. During free fall, the sensor drops at approximately 2.5m/s and data are sent in digital form to the surface via an electromechanical cable. Temperature and pressure data are sampled and digitized 52.5 times per second, equivalent to one data sample for each 4 cm of drop. Data resolution is 0.03 degrees C and 33 millibars for temperature and pressure, respectively. A winch of unique design is used to deploy and retrieve the sensor. The winch consists of an articulated spool which rotates to a vertical position during sensor deployment, allowing the cable to freely play out as the sensor falls. This technique effectively decouples the falling sensor from any surface motions at the winch support. For retrieval, the spool is rotated to a horizontal position and is driven by an electric motor for rewinding the sensor cable. Results of at-sea testing are presented. Included in the results are temperature profiles obtained under unattended operating conditions aboard a data buoy 800 miles north of Hawaii."
"An intermediate, high-seas research vessel design conceived at Woods Hole after extensive experience with the design and operation of oceanographic ships concentrated upon determining and meeting basic requirements and objectives for this type of vessel rather than emphasizing details of equipage, outfit and scientific equipment. The resulting design has attempted to provide a sound foundation in the form of a good hull design properly arranged to provide manned and operating spaces in the areas of least motion and a reduction of complication of basic equipment and operating procedures. As a result many aspects of equipage and outfit will still remain open and flexible at time of delivery making the design more adaptable to various oceanographic tasks. The construction of three ships has been funded by the National Science Foundation from this design."
"Reliable and highly replicable electro- retinograms (ERGs) have been obtained from California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) with non-invasive techniques. Preliminary results indicate that the ERG of sea lions is most responsive to stimulation with wavelengths from the blue, green, and orange portions of the human's visible spectrum. Stimulation with red light appears to produce small, but measurable, ERGs in the sea lion. Electrophysiological study of the visual and other sensory processes of marine mammals holds great potential for basic research, for training assessment, for clinical application, and for developing an understanding of the sensory processes of sea dwelling creatures."
"The general need for environmental information to manage a fishery is reviewed. For marine fisheries of regional extent such as the tropical tunas and Peruvian anchoveta, measurements of environmental parameters such as sea surface temperature and the location of surface oceanic fronts tax the sampling capabilities of research vessels that are usually available for this purpose. The inclusion of additional data from commercial and fishing vessels, while greatly improving the spatial density of data, still may not be adequate to produce maps of surface properties on a daily or weekly basis. The various types of parameters that can be measured or derived from remote sensors (aircraft and spacecraft) are reviewed and some benefits and limitations of each are noted. Much of the processing of remotely sensed data requires access to computers, particularly data from spacecraft. Some new instrumental techniques are discussed including the use of Low Light Level camera systems from aircraft and Very High Resolution Radiometers (VHRR) from polar orbiting NOAA spacecraft."
"The organization and operation of a citizen-volunteer group devoted to the protection of the marine environment is described. The use of privately owned boats and planes to supplement personnel of government agencies charged with enforcement of environmental legislation and to assist academic and scientific institutions demonstrates that this previously untapped resource can develop remote sensing techniques, conduct research, offer logistic support, serve as ground truth for a variety of missions, conduct water monitoring, and assist in the detection of illegal dredging, filling and waste discharges."
"Noting that oil and water have respectively unique properties for surface reflection of polarized skylight, an experimental device consisting of a TV camera with a special filter arrangement was constructed to use this principal to provide a remote means to discriminate for the presence of oil. Water, and other possibly present water soluable substances capable of giving false oil-tar-get images, can be observed in both polar planes. However, polarized light reflected from oil can only be observed in the horizontal plane. A light filtering system permitting a series of successive, rapid changes between the vertical and horizontal polar plane views causes the presence of oil to be observed as a flashing image against a relatively static background. This system has been flight tested, and shows some promise as a simplex, remote sensing instrument with an \"on-line\" capability for airborne surveillance for oil pollution."
"This paper summarizes a new technology developed explicitly for improved suspended sensor systems in the ocean. It describes briefly the systems approach, analytical techniques, synthetic strength members, cable construction, in-line sensors, fairing, buoyancy, end fittings, conductors, insulation bonding, and cost advantages currently being utilized for improved performance, versatility, and reliability at lower overall cost."
"Amplitudes of high-resolution seismic reflections are reduced to within the dynamic range of facsimile profile recording by linear time-varied gain followed by 10:1 logarithmic compression so that relative amplitudes can be distinguished. The asymmetric pulse of the high-resolution Bogmer enables the polarity of isolated reflections to be determined. Seismic systems have been calibrated so that measurements of peak reflection amplitudes could be interpreted, yielding reflection coefficients of -50 to -80% in cases where no deeper penetration was observed. Presumed reduction of acoustic impedance by gas has been confirmed by samples containing gas and decomposing biologic material. These improvements to amplitude and polarity display and calibration help interpretation of biologic zones and limits to penetration on seismic profiles."
"The development and sea tests of an acoustic hydraulic backup control system axe reviewed, and a functional description of the operational system is given. A review of the system's secure coding technique is presented. Design and manufacturing philosophy of the BOP backup system and application of acoustics to production well heads are discussed."
"Satellite altimetry offers significant potential for many applications in geodesy and oceanography. The Skylab altimeter experiment was the first of a series (GEOS-C, 1975; SEASAT, 1978, 1980; etc.) planned by NASA for launch over the next decade. One goal of satellite altimetry is to determine the geoid (mean sea level) over the oceans to ±10 cm accuracy. Battelle's responsibility in the Skylab altimetry program is to develop a technique for calibration and evaluation of the altimetry data to determine the geoid. Although the Skylab altimeter instrument accuracy is about ±1 m, significant results have been obtained in identification of large geoidal features such as over the Puerto Rican trench. Comparison of the results of several passes appears to indicate that the altimeter is capable of sensing more details in geoid variations than are presently available from other techniques. Review of techniques developed for recovery of the gravity anomaly from satellite altimetry and the potential applications of results to oceanography, geodesy and geophysics are discussed."
"A towing (or hook-up) block Is used as a guide or fair-lead for net tow cables at the stern of a side trawler. It must attach to the cables quickly, hold them securely during the trawling run, and release them at the end of each run in order for the nets to be brought on board. The towing-block now in use is slow and dangerous to operate, requiring the fisherman to encircle the heavily-loaded cables with his arms in attaching the block, and it must often be pried apart to release. It has been the cause of many injuries. A new towing-block has been designed which automatically secures as it is dropped or pushed onto the cables, and which may be released by pulling a lanyard. A prototype has been built and field tested. It has been enthusiastically accepted by the fishermen who have used it, and has been operated successfully in the field since October, 1974."
"In hydrodynamic research, it has been found that suspensions of asbestos fibers greatly reduce the friction in turbulent flow. The effect seems to be enhanced when high length-todiameter particles predominate in the suspensions. In this work new techniques of suspending, dispersing, and visualizing asbestos fibers have been utilized. The present paper shows how these techniques for hydrodynamics research can be adapted to the study of the carcinogenic potential of asbestos products."
"The Naval Research Laboratory has developed a cable television system for use with the deep ocean search equipment used to locate the lost submarines THRESHER, SCORPION, ALVIN, and EURYDICE. The video equipment differs from most previous long-cable (6000 m.) systems used in the deep ocean in that the television signals are heterodyned into the 0.5-4. 25 MHz band in order to eliminate interference with existing search-system telemetry without Incurring the very large cable losses encountered at higher frequencies. The resulting heterodyne equipment is unusual because the 3.75 MHz band width is of the same order of magnitude as the 4.25 MHz carrier frequency, rather than being much smaller as is the usual case. This unusual feature causes a number of problems which limit performance of the television system. The equipment was de signed to minimize the determental effects of these problems. The television system was integrated into the search equipment and sucessfully field tested aboard the USNS MIZAR in the fall of 1.974."
"Presents the back cover of this proceedings volume."
"Laser methods for the remote detection of oil present as a pollutant in the sea water using Raman backscattering and back scattered fluorescence are discussed and compared. The scattering spectra of oils excited by a cw Ar ion laser which were obtained by using a laser Raman spectro meter are described. Theoretical performance of a laser-Raman rader for the remote detection of oil are discussed. The back scattering spectra of oils in the sea water obtained by a laser rader scheme are also described."
"Technology transfer is a primary mission of most academic programs. The ease with which the transfer takes place is a function of methodology (or approach), environment (in an organizational and facility sense), and the personal characteristics of the participants. The unregulated flow of in formation (without smoothing the way) impedes transfer by creating turbulence. The College of Marine Studies of the University of Delaware, a professional graduate college, has made a conscious effort to facilitate low turbulence two way technology transfer with industry through its Industry Partners Program. Two way because it has been our experience that responsiveness and relevance correlate closely with an understanding of real world problems as perceived by the decision maker. Four modes of transfer are recognized: 1) The College as an intermediary between partners and external information sources, 2) The college as a tutor, 3) Brainstorming (two way exchange between partners and colleges), 4) Joint ventures with partners including prime and subcontract roles. A number of issues that are potential sources of turbulence are examined and the approach taken by the College briefly discussed."
"Simple extension of existing fishery acoustics procedures will result in unnecessary delays in adding acoustical fishery survey data to the existing fishery management techniques. Progress in the coupled collection of amplitude and frequency domain acoustical data from fish aggregation promise useful advances in the utility of fishery acoustic studies. Fishery management problems are listed and transitions in the management of acoustics development, in the technology, and the biological studies are recommended."
"A description is given of key areas of currently designed electrical systems for modern commercial submersibles. Included are the electrical distribution, main power, emergency power, propulsion, navigation, communications, and instrumentation systems. Consideration is also given to the application of independent failure analysis to key areas. Relating to this will be a brief discussion of design considerations for electrical systems operating in critical environmental spaces within the submersible. A recently delivered submersible is used as the center of discussion."
"The next generation of deep submersible ocean vehicles will require that more effective design approaches be utilized to achieve the full performance potential of this type of vehicle. Possible design shortcomings can be anticipated and corrected for through the exercise of a properly constructed computer program that models the salient features of the vehicle, its subsystems, the environment, and any specific operational mission requirements. A model has been developed by Sperry to assist in the design of deep submersible vehicles and their major subsystems, including sensors, propulsion unit, energy package, and vehicle structures. A variety of vehicle types manned or unmanned, tethered or independent, small or large can be modeled, as well as a variety of target and ocean bottom terrain features and mission profiles. The model consists of a 3700-statement Fortran V program having 34 subroutines. The program can provide an evaluation of the sensitivity of the significant vehicle performance measures to variations in design parameters. Computer generated graphs are presented to illustrate the utility of the model in several design problems including parameter determinations of propulsion system rating, weight, and size and navigation sensor accuracy requirements."
"The short range atomic arrangements in crystalline chitin, crystalline chitosan and amorphous chitosan films are shown to be similar in that the fundamental rings and chains are retained in all of these structures. The interchain bonding differs, however, and is weakest in amorphous chitosan and strongest in crystalline chitin."
"A detailed study of spectral conditions along with those other elements required to view color through water using television has resulted in rather stringent requirements for equipment and approaches used for this purpose. Data compiled on lighting, water, image sensors, and other factors, is used to predict equipment and system requirements. The results of these data emphasize the severe attenuation of wavelengths in the red region which indicates the need to use intensified vidicons or silicon diode image tubes in conjunction with tungsten-halogen light sources to assemble a color system practical for a wide range of applications. Types of color television systems are reviewed for their application to the underwater environment. The comparison indicates that many of the configurations would be impractical for underwater use, and that others would only be usable in limited applications. The requirements for an easily usable color system are examined by reviewing some of the applications for color real time viewing underwater. Some unique control configurations and packaging are proposed to meet the requirements of being easily usable."
"Design of efficient fish nets by means of small scale hydrodynamic models is of fairly recent origin in the United States. While investigators have developed basic equations for modeling flow around fish nets by considering the inertia and gravity forces as primary forces, they assume that the elastic deformations of twines and ropes in the net are negligible. However, the shape of the fish net and therefore the forces acting on it are affected by the elongation of twines and ropes under load. In order to allow the correct numerical transfer of model observations to the prototype, it is necessary to establish special hydrodynamic model laws which take the stress-strain characteristics of the model and prototype net materials into consideration. This paper outlines the establishment of such laws and their verification by full scale ocean tests and by laboratory tests. It is also shown how distortion of mesh and twine size prevents a relatively too high influence of viscous forces in the models."
"In most North American fresh water, clean stainless steel resists corrosive attack. In fresh water condenser tubing, there are very few reports of failures; most of these being found preventable upon investigation. At levels under 1,000 ppm chlorides, 18-8 Type 304 is used. In sea water, at higher chloride concentrations and temperatures, more alloy content is required; here, 316 has given excellent service in many applications, although cleaning is sometimes required to prevent fouling and crevice attack. In their respective applications, stainless steels have a proven successful application record."
"The paper presents a method for the simulation of the dynamic interaction between a trawler and its trawling gear. The main parameters affecting the interaction are the resistance forces acting on the gear and the trawler's hull, and the thrust made available by the propulsion system of the trawler. Inputs to the simulation method are trawling gear geometry, hull geometry, engine and propeller characteristics, and trawling speed. The output is a set of interaction curves showing the variation of hull and gear resistance with trawling speed, and available thrust as a function of speed and propeller rpm. The resistance of the trawl is obtained from theoretical and experimental studies conducted previously by the authors. Trawler hull resistance is obtained by means of a regression technique. In addition to simulating the actual trawler-trawling gear interaction the method can be used to predict the effects of changes made to the system on overall efficiency."
"This paper highlights new prototype development work using copper-nickel alloys for vessel hulls and seawater intake piping systems. Initially, maintenance-free performance and economies that can be realized through the use of copper-nickel alloys in salt water environments are described. Data presented shows performance of copper alloys under one of the most severe working conditions within the seawater system. The data was developed in performance studies of a copper-nickel-hulled fishing vessel during four years of operation. Savings resulting from the antifouling and corrosion resistant characteristics of the materials are discussed. Also covered is performance of dissimilar metal combinations in seawater. The second part concentrates on methods of construction with copper-nickel, copper-nickel-clad to steel and lamination to concrete structures. Details are given on attachment of large copper-nickel plates to steel framing and protection of this system from galvanic corrosion. Discussion also includes welding techniques and procedures for all-position field welding of solid copper-nickel and copper-nickel-clad steel."
"A procedure is reported for the stress analysis of straight cables subject to tension and torsion forces. Cables with one end free to rotate, or both ends fixed, are treated. Equations have been derived which are valid for a broad category of cable designs. Individual helical wires may have unique values for elastic modulus, strength and geometrical quantities; compressibility and material nonlinearity of the core element can be included; and geometric nonlinearity caused by large elongation or rotation is taken into account with exact mathematical expressions. The resulting equations are highly nonlinear; thus, they have been solved numerically on the computer. Approximate linear equations suitable for hand calculation also have been derived. Solutions have been obtained for two conventional steel cables and a cable utilizing armor wires fabricated from the organic filament, KEVLAR-49. In each case, good agreement with experimental results has been achieved."
"A method was developed for incorporating mixtures of creosote and other toxic chemicals into concrete by first impregnating a porous expanded shale aggregate with the toxic mixture. The impregnated aggregate was then mixed with port land cement and water to produce an antifouling marine concrete. Concrete panels made from aggregates impregnated with mixtures of creosote containing tributyltin oxide at levels of 100 to 250 ml per liter remained free of marine fouling for three years. The experimental antifouling concrete was not as strong as concrete made with sand and gravel, but there are well proven procedures of concrete technology that can be employed to increase its strength."
"The dynamics of tsunamis can be broadly classified into: a) generation; b) propagation across the ocean; and c) the coastal problem. Here the source mechanisms for the seismic generation of tsunamis are briefly reviewed. The generation of tsunamis by sources other than earthquakes, such as volcanic ex plosions, landslides, and underground nuclear tests are also considered. Tsunamis propagate across the oceans in the form of long gravity waves and travel time charts that are in use are briefly reviewed. The prediction of tsunami amplitudes on the coast, through numerical models, and empirical and statistical models, is then considered. Finally, the present day tsunami warning systems are reviewed and recent advances such as using T-phase and atmospheric internal gravity waves are considered."
"Two 100-fathom open ocean disposal sites were monitored to assess the impact of the dumping of dredged materials upon the marine environment. One site was located 35 miles from San Francisco, CA near the Farallon Islands and the other 7.7 miles from San Diego, CA. Water quality and sediment parameters were measured and photographic surveys of the bottom were made with the Naval Undersea Center's remote-controlled research vehicle CURV III. The objectives of the Farallon site survey were to obtain qualitative descriptions of the physical, chemical and biological environment of the area and of the general release pattern of dredged material. Although the material was deposited unevenly over the deposition area, most fell directly below the path of the hoppers. The purpose of the San Diego site survey was to monitor a previously unused dump site before, during and after dumping. Results of the pre-dump survey showed the physical-chemical con- ditions of the area to be comparable to other near-shore areas of Southern California."
"Ships of the Navy operate in one of the most hostile and aggressive natural environments known to man - the seas and their surroundings. The two major considerations which influence the selection of materials for the fabrication of ship systems and components are: 1) the specific operating environment and 2) application related factors. Environment/application dependencies are particularly significant in the selection of materials for piping and machinery systems. Components in these systems must possess inherent resistance to corrosion, fouling and other forms of deterioration, since it is impractical to apply coatings or cathodic protection to the internal surfaces. The rationale for material selection criteria is illustrated by analyzing several selected machinery components in terms of specific operating environment and application related factors."
"A knowledge of the extent and type of shoreline vegetation on which Pacific herring annually deposit adhesive eggs is helpful in determining the amount of spawn deposited and hence the size of the spawning population. Low-level aerial photography was evaluated as a means of preparing maps of shoreline vegetation. Maps of spawning localities in Barkley Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island were drawn from color infrared and color aerial photographs at a scale of 1:3600. The charts were assessed in terms of accuracy and species composition of vegetation zones by a scuba-diving survey."
"A chelate-ion exchange matrix has been successfully sandwiched between membrane filters to construct physical-chemical analogs which resemble living membranes in their adsorptive capacity of transition metals. The fabricated disc (Metro-Disc*) selectively adsorbs and concentrates metallic ions by a factor up to 1000 over the ambient background concentration in aqueous solution. Combined with multi- channel emission spectrophotometry, the Metro- Disc offers rapid determination of microgram/kg quantities of Cu2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Zn2+, and Cr6+, in water."
"An M.I.T. developed analytical model of hydraulic and water quality parameters has been applied to the Conowingo Reservoir on the Susquehanna River by Environmental Devices Corporation of Marion, Massachusetts. The purpose of the application is to predict the ambient temperature distribution of the reservoir, since this ambient is now masked by the recent start up of the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station. Verification of the model was carried out using six months of hydraulic and thermal data collected before the plant became operational. Model runs are now conducted on a monthly basis using current meteorological, hydraulic and thermal data. Comparison of the predicted ambient and the currently monitored thermal regime yields an estimation of the thermal impact of the atomic power station. This case study demonstrates an extremely valuable use of such models in environmental impact studies."
"The purpose of this system is to hold, rear and culture marine biota under conditions of con trolled temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Each of the parameters is to be capable of wide range, rapid, and independent control. The physical requirements and limitations associated with parameter changes in the flow through system are examined. The problems of parameter interaction and, when applicable, the nonconservative nature of the parameters are also examined. A conceptual frame work within which to optimally examine and describe the control problem is developed and then used to determine system requirements. Several implementations are developed and a particular configuration is recommended."
"Laboratory measurements of sound absorption using the resonator technique have confirmed that sound absorption in sea water is about ten times greater than the predicted value and that it is due to boric acid. In conjunction with the acoustic measurements done in a 200 liter spherical glass resonator, the relaxation frequency of the boric acid was measured using the temperature-jump technique for chemical kinetic studies. A three state chemical reaction is required for a quantitative explanation of the observed absorption and relaxation frequency. Besides providing confirmation of effect discovered by long range sound propagation work at sea, it has revealed a new aspect of boron chemistry."
"The acoustic scattering from density discontinuities in turbulent jet flows has been studied to determine the conditions under which high frequency acoustic soundings can be useful as a flow field diagnostic tool. Laboratory experiments employing a variable-density turbulent jet exhausting into ambient water are described. The acoustic re turns from the jet at 3 and 6 MHz were correlated with turbulent density fluctuation data; the acoustic data can then be extrapolated to full-scale flow situations. The study shows that field measurements of the acoustic return from a turbulent, density stratified jet can be used to determine the flow field properties without direct sampling or measurements in the jet. Such full-scale measurements could provide a viable technique for studying both effluent plumes in connection with pollution abatement efforts, and oceanic diffusion processes and thermocline structures. The applications of this technique to the coolant water discharge from an electric power plant, and to the flow in a stratified estuary are considered."
"This paper discusses a recently-developed computer retrieval technique for obtaining useful and reliable sound-speed profiles for applications in underwater acoustic modeling. In addition to selecting a model sound-speed profile, the technique also provides information on the horizontal and vertical characteristics of the sound-speed environment for any combination of temporal and spatial conditions as well as options for plotting, modifying, filtering or punching the selected sound speed profiles."
"A real time experimental holographic acoustic imaging system called \"Automatic System for Evaluation and Simulation (ASES)\" has been built and tested to assess filled array holographic acoustic imaging systems for underwater viewing. The hardware is described and some of its performance parameters are listed. Qualitative results are given and some quantitative results are discussed."
"Development of an automated system for quantitative processing of ocean-bottom reflected echo sounder signals is described. This system incorporates a mini computer for digitization, processing and display in real time of the reflection data. The system was developed in conjuction with the Deep Tow project of the Marine Physical Laboratory of Scripps Institution of Oceanography and has been utilized to process data from a 4-kHz bottom profiler system on the Deep Tow Instrument. This Instrument is normally towed close to the bottom (100 meters altitude) by means of an armored coaxial cable, thus greatly improving the lateral resolution of the profiler system. The processing system digitizes the raw 4-kHz signal, stores the digitized data for future reference, and displays a normalized and smoothed version of the data on a facsimile-type graphic recorder. Typically, a display of instantaneous energy and displays of cumulative energy for selected vertical sections are presented simultaneously. In addition, the system has been utilized to calculate reflected energy returned from buried layers as a function of depth of burial in an effort to estimate acoustic attenuation in the overlying sediments. Processed data from several areas of the Pacific has revealed abrupt changes in sedimentary reflectivity of over 7dB, small-scale spatial variations in reflectivity of several dB over horizontal distances less than 100 meters, and several dB variations in reflected energy due to small-scale topographic features of buried reflectors. In addition, attenuation calculations have determined values for acoustic attenuation in calcareous equatorial sediments which are almost 1/3 of those determined for North Pacific sediments of comparable porosity."
"The sensitive use of explosives in ship salvage operations is described with a brief review of the physical phenomena involved in underwater explosive cutting. Specific problems encountered in the design and use of shaped charge cutters are identified; actual on site improvisations are summarized from recent and current case histories of ship salvage involving extensive explosive cutting. Prime factors leading to successful results with explosives in ship salvage are considered and clarified."
"This paper presents the technical criteria developed by a multidiscipline siting team faced with the task of identifying optimum sites for floating nuclear power plants on the East and Gulf coasts of the U.S. These criteria, weighted in terms of their relative importance, establish a quantitative basis for systematically making appropriate subjective decisions in similar studies. Criteria are defined, the methodology by which they were developed outlined and the way in which they are implemented in site selection decisions explained."
"The Floating Nuclear Plant (FNP), has a great deal of siting flexibility. Offshore siting is only a part of the total FNP siting story. There are several alternatives that, when combined with offshore siting, provide a very broad spectrum of potential locations for the Floating Nuclear Plant. In order to ensure that the FNP can be sited in a wide variety of locations, it is designed to a broad envelope of conditions. The site envelope parameters were carefully selected so that an optimum balance between siting flexibility and manufacturing costs was achieved. It is this broad site envelope that allows many siting applications other than the classical (2-3 mile) \"offshore\" concept. The alternatives that are considered here include examples of offshore, nearshore, riverine and onshore site designs that have been developed for specific locations in the last year, but are applicable to similar sites in other locations. These designs are applications of the siting concepts that have been developed over the last few years."
"The hybrid simulation and a prototype digital controller for closed loop control of a marine nuclear propulsion plant are described in this paper. The high order hybrid simulation is based on a representative mathematical model of the nuclear steam supply system. The control strategies developed for the coordinated control of the reactor, the steam generators, the feedwater systems and the propulsion turbines of the plant are derived from a simplified discrete model of the high order simulation. The control strategies are implemented on a digital minicomputer that serves as the prototype controller, and is interfaced with the hybrid computing facility. Results for several normal and abnormal maneuvering rates are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the prototype digital controller."
"The Federal Government's involvement in marine hard minerals began with the Truman Proclamation on the Continental Shelf in 1945. In the 30 years since then, government involvement in marine hard minerals mining has been sporadic and controversial. In the last decade, increasing interest by industry has focused attention on the government roles to the point where they may now be better defined. Two separate areas of involvement include the Outer Continental Shelf and the Seabed Beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction. The major role is seen for the Department of Interior as resource manager (USGS, BLM, Bureau of Mines and MESA), with specialist roles for State in international aspects, Commerce in charting and mapping, environmental monitoring (NOAA), and certain fiscal responsibilities, and ancillary roles in coastal and near shore waters for the Environmental Protection Agency, the Army (Corps of Engineers), and Transportation (Coast Guard). The National Science Foundation (IDOE) has an important role in basic scientific research."
"The expendable sonobuoy is a complex one-shot device that calls for specialized cost control concepts during production. Lot acceptance is based on sample testing and each rejected lot presents a cost burden to the producer. This paper develops a simple cost model that provides visibility to problem areas and aids in cost justification of product improvement programs to increase reliability."
"The University of Delaware, College of Marine Studies, in conjunction with J. W. Gilbert Associates, Inc., has designed a unique vessel for coastal zone oceanographic research work. The vessel is now under construction in Morgan City, Louisiana. Unique features of the vessel include its relatively high cruising speed, automated galley, modular laboratory furnishings and use of portable laboratory vans. Length overall of the vessel is 120 ft (36.58 m), its beam is 23 ft 2 in (7.07 m) and its draft midships is 4 ft 4 in (1.32 m). A crew of 6 will man the vessel, which can berth an additional 12 scientists. A cruising speed of about 18 knots is obtained by utilizing all aluminum construction and a semi-displacement crewboat hull. Low speed maneuvering and stationkeeping ability are maintained by use of twin rudders and twin controllable pitch propellers."
"The Naval Undersea Center has developed a new range support surface craft utilizing a design that should offer considerable advantage for oceanic research as compared to a conventional monohull ship. The 190-ton, 25-knot craft is called the SSP (Stable Semisubmerged Platform). It was designed to permit operations under adverse wind and wave conditions in deep water. Unusual features of the craft include greatly reduced motion in waves relative to a conventional monohull when at rest or underway, a large deck area and internal volume, and sustained speed capability even in large waves. The 89-foot SSP consists of two submerged, parallel, torpedo-like hulls which support a cross structure above water by means of four streamlined, surface-piercing struts. A stabilizing fin spans the gap between the hull tailcones. Small fins attached near the hull noses and flaps in the stabilizing fin provide control over heave, pitch, and roll when underway. A 12 1/2-by-23-foot well in the center of the cross structure permits devices to be raised and lowered from the platform. The craft has thus far operated as predicted in preliminary trials. The concept scales readily to larger sizes. Possible 500-ton and 3000-ton versions for oceanic research are also discussed."
"Longitudinal berthing has been used tradition ally aboard most Navy ships. As a mixture of athwartship and longitudinal berthing could result in improved habitability and space utilization, information was needed to indicate whether there were any deleterious effects of athwartship berthing which would prohibit its use. Athwartship berthing is currently extensively used aboard passenger, cargo, and fishing vessels. In every category examined, from large to small, both stabilized and unstabilized, there were ships possessing significant percentages of athwartship berthing orientations. Interviews with knowledgeable personnel resulted in a wide variety of strongly felt opinions about personal preferences for berth orientation, but no respondent was able to cite deleterious effects of this orientation. A mixture of berth orientations may and should be incorporated in future ship designs."
"The AEB is a remote unattended data acquisition and telemetry system designed for deployment on ice covered seas. The total system as presently configured consists of up to 12 AEBs and a Central Control Station (CCS). The Central Control Station under computer control collects the data from the AEBs, processes the data and formats the data on a digital tape for future analysis. The CCS is also capable of controlling the majority of the AEB functions via a command link. The AEB is configured to sample sensor data and acquire position data at three hour intervals automatically. The present sensor configuration allows 6 primary sensors with 10 bit resolution and 16 auxiliary sensors with 5 bit resolution. The auxiliary sensors are sampled only once per day. The sensor data and position data are stored in a digital memory which is transmitted via an H.F. link once per day to the Central Control Station. A unique dual memory concept is utilized to prevent data loss due to propagation vagaries and polar cap absorption events. The position measurements are accomplished by an on-board NAVSAT receiver."
"A nuclear reactor plant intended for marine service must be designed to accommodate the unique features of that environment. The items considered unique to a maritime reactor include the following: 1. Ship motions of roll, pitch, heave, sway, yaw, and surge. 2. Vibration of ship's hull. 3. Design for protection against ship accidents. 4. Lack of offsite electrical power. 5. Concept of \"ship's safety\" versus \"reactor safety.\" Design problems relating to these and solutions to or programs to provide solutions are presented."
"The peripheral circuits of a 4K RAM, simplified to allow a chip size of 122 × 165 mils, with a 5-mask process, will be described. Testing affords measurement of the internal safe operating margins, where the signal levels are 106electrons or 160 mV."
"A photosensing device, based on the CID principle, yielding improved signal-to-noise performance, will be described. Its implementation in a matrix structure leads to simple addressing, making it attractive for data capture."
"THE USE OF METAL oxide transparent electrodesiin a high density charge injection imager device (CID)‾1 array has increased the sensitivity and has flattened and extended the spectral response to shorter wavelengths in the blue (40008). Experimentally determined spectral response curves of operational self-scanning CLD imager arrays will be presented. The difficulties associated with the use of polycrystalline"

"CHARGE-COUPLED DEVICE (CCD) technology has been used to fabricate a high-resolution, low-blooming, 512 x 320 element silicon image device that generates standard 525-line TV pictures. The choice of this cell count has been described previously1. The device uses a unique single-layer doped polysilicon gate structure. This structure maintains the basic simplicity of the original single-layer devices (self alignment of gates, no steps in gate structure causing opens, and single mask level for all CCD gates), but avoids the gap charging problem. The individual gates are formed by doping Nt regions in a P-layer of polysilicon on top of the channel oxide. This results in low leakage between gates. Since there are no exposed gaps, a stable sealed channel structure results. The polysilicon layer is transparent to most wavelengths and there are no opaque areas to cause aliasing. Aluminum is used for a low resistance, double-ended gate-bus connection and to supply bonding pads. "

"Errors in acoustic-phonetic recognition occur not only because of the limited scope of the recognition algorithm, but also because certain ambiguities are inherent in analyzing the speech signal. Examples of such ambiguities in segmentation and labeling (feature extraction) are given. In order to allow for these phenomena and to deal effectively with acoustic recognition errors, we have devised a lattice representation of the segmentation which allows for multiple choices that can be sorted out by higher level processes. A description of the current acoustic-phonetic recognition program in the Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) Speech Understanding System is given, along with a specification of the parameters used in the recognition."
"A system, the modular acoustic processor (MAP) consisting of two major components, has been designed for work in speech recognition. A versatile spectral analysis system, the parametrically controlled analyzer (PCA), serves as input to an hierarchically operated string transcriber (HOST). In the design of this system, controllability and modularity for developmental extensibility were primary concerns. The system, with the exception of initial high-fidelity, direct A/D conversion, is entirely implemented in software, PL/I, with appropriate JCL structures for running under OS/MVT on an IBM 360-91. As an adjunct for obtaining training data, a grayscale interactive system using an IBM 1800 process-control computer has also been implemented. PCA signal processing features parametric selection of several analysis methods, including discrete Fourier transform (DFT), linear predictive coding (LPC), and chirp z-transform (CZT). Also, selection may be made among various smoothing, normalization, interpolation, and F0estimation methods. PCA develops high-quality spectrographic representations of speech for standard line printers, CRT display, and subsequent processing. PCA also performs spectral-similarity matching and training. HOST consists of a number of processes for performing segmentation, classification, and prosody analysis. Provision is made for complete commutability at the module level as well as at the algorithm level. The segmentation/classification output of HOST is augmented by estimates of confidence. PCA is a packaged, debugged, running system. A first version of HOST is operational."
"Basic problems involved in automatic recognition of continuous speech are discussed with reference to the recently developed template matching technique using dynamic programming. Irregularities in phonetic manifestations of phonemes are discussed and it is argued that the syllable, phonologically redefined, will serve as the effective minimal unit in the time domain. English syllable structures are discussed from this point of view using the notions of \"syllable features\" and \"vowel affinity.\""
"One function of the Semantics component of SPEECH-LIS, the Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) Speech Understanding System, is to gather evidence for hypotheses it has made regarding the content of an utterance, as well as to evaluate the hypotheses made by other components. Another is to produce a representation of the utterance's meaning. Specifically, this involves forming consistent, meaningful collections of words which match regions of the speech waveform, and evaluating and interpreting the possible syntactic structures built of them. This paper discusses the data structures and organization of SPEECHLIS semantics and how they are directed to the above two tasks."
"This paper considers a sequential strategy for acoustic-phonetic speech analysis. Each analysis process is applied to an appropriately labeled speech segment and results in a possible sub-segmentation of the original segment. The segments resulting from the analysis are labeled according to the analysis results. The advantages of the strategy are that no more segments are considered than those actually differentiated by the analysis steps. The extraction of acoustic cues pertinent to a phonetic feature can be tuned to classes of sounds separated on the basis of other cues, and this serves to increase the reliability of segment labeling. The analysis sequence yields a structure for the syllabic units of the speech signal that may be used to retrieve similar syllabic units for detailed comparison."
"The autocorrelation method for linear-predictive coding of speech [1] has been implemented in real time on the SPS-41, a commercially available system composed of three dissimilar microprocessors working in parallel. Using user-written microcode, one processor performs I/O and master control, the second handles loop indexing and counting, and the third does the actual arithmetic on data. Such parallelism allows 2 × 106I/O operations and 4 × 106multiplications/s, but actually realizing this potential requires fresh approaches to some old algorithms. Most important is a new autocorrelation scheme with several valuable properties. Using 16-bit fixed-point single-precision arithmetic to accumulate autocorrelation sums and invert the autocorrelation matrix presents problems which have been solved reasonably well. The present program converts frames of 256 16-bit samples into 14 coefficients and then into 128 points of logarithmic power spectrum at 100 frames/s."
"Our strategy for computer understanding of speech uses prosodic features to break up continuous speech into sentences and phrases and locate stressed syllables in those phrases. The most reliable phonetic data are obtained by performing a distinguishing features analysis within the stressed syllables and by locating sibilants and other robust information in unstressed syllables. The numbers and locations of syntactic boundaries and stressed syllables are used to select likely syntactic and semantic structures, within which words are hypothesized to correspond to the partial distinguishing features matrices obtained from the segmental analyses. Portions of this strategy have been implemented and tested with hundreds of seconds of speech, involving fifteen talkers. A program for detecting syntactic boundaries from fall-rise patterns in fundamental frequency contours correctly detected ever 90 percent of all predicted boundaries. An algorithm for locating stressed syllables (from fundamental frequency contours and high-energy syllabic nuclei) correctly located the nuclei of over 85 percent of all those syllables perceived as stressed by a panel of listeners. A study of segmental analysis results obtained by several other research groups showed that phonetic recognition clearly is most successful in the stressed syllables. Procedures for classification of stressed vowels, location and classification of sibilants, and location of stops, nasals, and [r]-like sounds have been implemented. Prosodic aids to parsing and semantic analysis are being investigated."
"A tree-search algorithm was utilized in decoding the noisy phonetic output of an acoustic processor (AP) for purposes of automatic recognition of continuous speech. A 250-word lexicon and a finite-state grammar specify the tree to be searched. The search is performed in a best-first manner where partial paths having the highest similarity measure are extended first. The similarity measure of a word represents the degree of match of the noisy input with the best-fitting phonetic variant of that word. Phonetic variants for each word are generated automatically by a set of phonological rules. Computation of the similarity measure is based on statistics characterizing the performance of the AP. These statistics were obtained from training data by an iterative procedure. Performance results are given for both training and test data. Substantial improvement over earlier performance on the same data was realized."
"CASPERS (Computer-Automated Speech Perception System) is a user-modifiable facility for translating strings of acoustic Symbols into sentences. Three distinctive aspects of the system's design will be discussed: the dynamic application of acoustic-phonological rules across word boundaries, an acoustic-unit splitting-and merging strategy for treating the dictionary matching problem, and an extensive capability for handling semantic routines within an augmented context-free grammar."
"A set of fast-speech rules has been tested on the computer using the phonological grammar tester (PGT) program of Friedman and Morin. We examine the types of difficulties encountered in the rules and discuss ways in which the program can be made more useful for studying fast-speech rules."
"This paper presents some phonological rules which describe systematic pronunciation variation occurring in natural continuous speech. It is argued that a speech understanding system must account for such variation by incorporating phonological rules, either implicitly or explicitly, into the system. Spectrographic evidence for the phonological phenomena described by the rules is included."
"When a person hears an English sentence, he uses many sources of information to assign structure and meaning to the utterance. One of these sources, syntax, is concerned with the goal of producing a consistent, meaningful, grammatical structure for the sentence. The exact type of structure produced is not as crucial as the process of building that structure because the speech environment has inherent problems which make the parsing of speech a much more complex task than the parsing of text. For example, lexical ambiguity, caused by variations in articulation and imperfect or imprecise phoneme recognition, would lead to a combinatorial explosion in conventional parsers. This paper describes the design of the Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) speech parser with emphasis on the reasons for using the formalism of transition network grammars and on the interaction of the syntactic component with other parts of the system. A detailed example is given to illustrate the operation of the parser."
"A computer system is described in which isolated words, spoken by a designated talker, are recognized through calculation of a minimum prediction residual. A reference pattern for each word to be recognized is stored as a time pattern of linear prediction coefficients (LPC). The total log prediction residual of an input signal is minimized by optimally registering the reference LPC onto the input autocorrelation coefficients using the dynamic programming algorithm (DP). The input signal is recognized as the reference word which produces the minimum prediction residual. A sequential decision procedure is used to reduce the amount of computation in DP. A frequency normalization with respect to the long-time spectral distribution is used to reduce effects of variations in the frequency response of telephone connections. The system has been implemented on a DDP-516 computer for the 200-word recognition experiment. The recognition rate for a designated male talker is 97.3 percent for telephone input, and the recognition time is about 22 times real time."
"This paper presents an algorithm that determines the fundamental frequency of sampled speech by segmenting the signal into pitch periods. Segmentation is achieved by identifying those samples of the waveform corresponding to the beginning of each pitch period. The segmentation is accomplished in three phases. First, using zero crossing and energy measurements, a data structure is constructed from the speech samples. This structure contains candidates for pitch period markers. Next, the number of candidate markers within this structure is reduced utilizing syllabic segmentation, coarse pitch frequency estimations, and discrimination functions. Finally, the remaining pitch period markers are corrected, compensating for errors introduced by the data reduction process. This algorithm processes both male and female speech, provides a voiced-unvoiced decision, and operates in real time on a medium speed, general purpose computer."
"A major difficulty in the development of methodologies for segmentation and classification in automatic recognition of continuous speech is the determination of objective, reliable performance statistics. Compounding this difficulty is the large amount of data necessary to make reasonably accurate performance estimates. The system to be described provides for concurrent objective evaluation of up to five independent segmentation/classification methods against a single, carefully transcribed referent. A basic assumption of the evaluator is that the systems to be compared, as well as the referent, can each use the same digital data as input. Violation of this assumption would lead to time-shift errors, and objective comparison among systems would be exceedingly difficult. For segmentation, the evaluator provides first-order statistics, at the phonetic, class and summary levels, in the form of highly concise tables for the following four types of errors: 1) Missed events; 2) Adventitious events; 3) Misplaced events; and 4) Adventitious and misplaced events. For classification, first-order statistics are derived in the form of confusion matrices at the phonetic, class and summary levels. While the system is still in the developmental process, it is operational and currently used. Examples of output will be presented."

"SPEECHLIS is a research prototype of an intelligent speech understanding system which makes use of advanced techniques of artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and acoustical and phonological analysis in an integrated way to determine the interpretation of continuous speech utterances. This paper describes a number of the characteristics of the speech understanding task which influence the ways in which syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and lexical knowledge interact with acoustical and phonological information in the process of understanding speech utterances. The focus is on what the different knowledge sources have to contribute at different points in the analysis and the organization of a computer system to combine these different sources of information into an integrated system."
"Hearsay II (HSII) is a system currently under development at Carnegie-Mellon University to study the connected speech understanding problem. It is similar to Hearsay I (HSI) in that it is based on the hypothesize-and-test paradigm, using cooperating independent knowledge sources communicating with each other through a global data structure (blackboard). It differs in the sense that many of the limitations and shortcomings of HSI are resolved in HSII. The main new features of the Hearsay II system structure are: 1) the representation of knowledge as self-activating, asynchronous, parallel processes, 2) the representation of the partial analysis in a generalized three-dimensional network (the dimensions being level of representation (e.g., acoustic, phonetic, phonemic, lexical, syntactic), time, and alternatives) with contextual and structural support connections explicitly specified, 3) a convenient modular structure for incorporating new knowledge into the system at any level, and 4) a system structure suitable for execution on a parallel processing system. The main task domain under study is the retrieval of daily wire-service news stories upon voice request by the user. The main parametric representations used for this study are 1/3-octave filter-bank and linear-predictive coding (LPC)-derived vocal tract parameters [10], [11]. The acoustic segmentation and labeling procedures are parameter-independent [7]. The acoustic, phonetic, and phonological components [23] are feature-based rewriting rules which transform the segmental units into higher level phonetic units. The vocabulary size for the task is approximately 1200 words. This vocabulary information is used to generate word-level hypotheses from phonetic and surface-phonemic levels based on prosodic (stress) information. The syntax for the task permits simple English-like sentences and is used to generate hypotheses based on the probability of occurrence of that grammatical construct [19]. The semantic model is based on the news items of the day, analysis of the conversation, and the presence of certain content words in the partial analysis. This knowledge is to be represented as a production system. The system is expected to be operational on a 16-processor minicomputer system [3] being built at Carnegie-Mellon University. This paper deals primarily with the issues of the system organization of the HSII system."
 "This paper briefly describes the major features of the DRAGON speech understanding system. DRAGON makes systematic use of a general abstract model to represent each of the knowledge sources necessary for automatic recognition of continuous speech. The model--that of a probabilistic function of a Markov process--is very flexible and leads to features which allow DRAGON to function despite high error rates from individual knowledge sources. Repeated use of a simple abstract model produces a system which is simple in structure, but powerful in capabilities."
"A system for acoustic-phonetic analysis of continuous speech is being developed to serve as part of an automatic speech understanding system. The acoustic system accepts the speech wave-form as an input and produces as output a string of phoneme-like units referred to as acoustic phonetic elements (APEL's). This paper should be considered as a progress report, since the system is still under active development. The initial phase of the acoustic analysis consists of signal processing and parameter extraction, and includes spectrum analysis via linear prediction, computation of a number of parameters of the spectrum, and fundamental frequency extraction. This is followed by a preliminary segmentation of the speech into a few broad acoustic categories and formant tracking during vowel-like segments. The next phase consists of more detailed segmentation and classification intended to meet the needs of subsequent linguistic analysis. The preliminary segmentation and segment classification yield the following categories: vowel-like sound; volume dip within vowel-like sound; fricative-like sound; stop consonants, including silence or voice bar, and associated burst. These categories are produced by a decision tree based upon energy measurements in selected frequency bands, derivatives and ratios of these measurements, a voicing detector, and a few editing rules. The more detailed classification algorithms include: 1) detection and identification of some diphthongs, semivowels, and nasals, through analysis of formant motions, positions, and amplitudes; 2) a vowel identifier, which determines three ranked choices for each vowel based on a comparison of the formant positions in the detected vowel segment to stored formant positions in a speaker-normalized vowel table; 3) a fricative identifier, which employs measurement of relative spectral energies in several bands to group the fricative segments into phoneme-like categories; 4) stop consonant classification based on the properties of the plosive burst. The above algorithms have been tested on a substantial corpus of continuous speech data. Performance results, as well as detailed descriptions of the algorithms are given."
"Automatic speech understanding must accommodate the fact that an entirely accurate and precise acoustic transcription of speech is unattainable. By applying knowledge about the phonology, syntax, and semantics of a language and the constraints imposed by a task domain, much of the ambiguity in an attainable transcription can be resolved. This paper deals with how to control the application of such knowledge. A control framework is presented in which hypotheses about the meaning of an utterance are automatically formed and evaluated to arrive at an acceptable interpretation of the utterance. This design is currently undergoing computer implementation as a part of the Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) Speech Understanding System (SPEECHLIS)."
"An A-D and D-A converter system with exceptionally wide dynamic range and low distortion is discussed. The system utilizes 12-bit floating-point approximation at conversion instead of true 16-bit conversion. A deglitching track and hold is illustrated which avoids heterodyning between signal components and the sample clock. Rate-limiting during the transition from hold to track is discussed."
  "An experiment was designed to compare the formant 1 (F1) and formant 2 (F2) frequency movements of vowels next to /r/ with the same vowels next to other consonants. The data for this experiment were based on formant trajectories computed by the linear prediction coefficient (LPC) technique on a digital computer. The results indicate that with the exception of /i/ the effect of initial /r/ on the following syllable nuclei could be considered minimal. The effect of final /r/ on the syllable nuclei preceding it is appreciable. Algorithms are postulated to define a retroflexed vowel space for vowels preceding /r/ in terms of the nonretroflexed vowel space."
"The mathematical structure of the digital ambiguity function for a matched filtered linear FM (LFM) waveform is derived as a function of time-bandwidth product, sampling rate, and arbitrary delay and frequency shifts. It is found to be well behaved for sampling rates equal to or greater than the swept signal bandwidth, provided that time sidelobes are controlled using standard frequency domain weighting techniques. A digital convolution processor comprised of cascaded pipeline fast Fourier transforms (FFT's) is presented as a viable architecture for real-time filtering of moderately high bandwidth LFM signals, and tradeoffs among radix, pipeline clock rate, and convolutional efficiency are discussed. It is found that a modified floating-point computational scheme performs well in such a context and is especially useful if a large signal dynamic range must be accommodated. A radix-4 4096-point design example is considered and the effects of quantization and finite register length arithmetic upon the digital ambiguity function are demonstrated via simulation. It is found that input data, FFT coefficients, reference filter coefficients, and intermediate results can be represented with mantissas of modest bit length."
"The approximation of attenuation curve for a recursive digital filter is solved for arbitrary specifications in the stop-band and in the pass-band. The problem is split into two parts; the first one uses the classical theory of the transformed plane and the second one works with linear programming. The method is illustrated by some specific examples."
"The use of cepstral analysis is helpful for some problems where two one-dimensional signals are combined by convolution [1]. In such problems it is important to ensure that the phase function associated with the resultant signal may be defined so that it is a continuous, odd, and periodic function of frequency [2], [3]. One class of one-dimensional signals which have this property is the class whose z-transforms are rational polynomials [2]. In this correspondence, we shall show that these results are extendible to two dimensions, and that 2-D cepstra can be defined for 2-D rational polynomials."
"The partitioned modified chirp Z-transform (PAM-CZT) is a signal processing technique which aids in the analysis of acoustically propagated ocean noises. The technique utilizes the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to allow real time computation in which long time data are processed in short-time-ordered sequences, thus providing spectral analysis to any frequency resolution."
"A new approach to the digital filter realization problem is proposed in this paper. In this approach multipliers are extracted one at a time successively in the development of all realizations. The approach is illustrated by finding all possible realizations of a second-order transfer function containing two delays, four multipliers, and four two-input adders with the added restriction that no products of multipliers appear in the expression for the transfer function."
"A new method is proposed for estimating the frequency domain structure of digital signals which may be characterized as having a narrow-band, rapidly time-varying spectrum. The estimated parameter is termed the digital instantaneous frequency of the input and is defined in a manner similar to that used previously to describe frequency-modulated, continuous-time signals. Instantaneous frequency estimates are derived from a spectral computation based on the use of an adaptive linear prediction filter. The proposed method differs from previous techniques in that the coefficients of this filter are continuously updated as each new input data sample is received using a simple time-domain algorithm, A derivation of the algorithm and its properties are presented. Numerical examples are included which illustrate the properties of the procedure."
"The paper describes a parsing program developed at the Electrotechnical Laboratory, Tokyo, Japan, in 1968 for automatic speech synthesis from ordinary English spelling. The parser handles unique problems for a speech production system, especially of phrase-structure analysis in regard to stress and pause assignments. The parsing program consists of a dictionary of about 1500 most frequently used words, a simple syntactic analyzer and a breath-group delimiter. The syntactic analyzer, with the assistance of information stored in the dictionary, divides the sentence into phrases, and assigns pause markers at major syntactic boundaries; the breath-group delimiter decides actual pauses and sentence stress. The output of the parsing program consists of a sequence of phonemes with stress marks and of phrase termination marks. These letters and marks are transformed into vocal tract shapes, duration, and pitch signals in the subsequent part of the synthesis system. The parsing program, written in the PL/I language, consists of about 1900 statements."
"The aim of this study was to determine a set of acoustic features in the speech signal that are effective for the identification of a speaker. The investigation examined a large number of theoretically attractive features. The analysis technique of linear prediction was incorporated to examine features that were previously ignored because their measurement was either too time consuming or not easily amenable to automatic measurement. A novel probability of error criterion was used to determine the the relative merits of the features. The experimental data base was collected over a3\\frac{1}{2}year period and afforded the oportunity to investigate the variation over time of the measurements. The measurements that were found to be the most important were the value of the second resonance (around 1000 Hz) in /n/, the value of the third or fourth resonance (1700-2000 Hz) in /m/ the values of the second, third and fourth formant frequencies in vowels, and the average fundamental frequency of the speaker. A speaker identification experiment using only the best five features was performed. The test data consisted of the multisession data of 11 speakers, and the test data was kept independent of the design data. One error was made in the identification of these speakers for 320 separate identification experiments."
"We consider the power spectrum Y(f) of the staircase sequence{y_{r}}in the linear delta modulation (LDM) of a band-limited signal sequence,{x_{r}}. Within the signal band Y(f) approximates the input spectrum X(f) with an accuracy that depends on two parameters: the LDM step-size Δ and the over-sampling F (ratio of sampling rate in LDM to the Nyquist rate for the bandlimited input), or equivalently, the correlation C between adjacent input samples. We demonstrate Y(f) dependencies on Δ and F (or C) using Gauss-Markov and speech inputs in a computer simulation. For speech, we consider the specific problem of preserving, in Y(J), the formant frequencies of a short-term input spectrum X(f). We observe, for example, when F = 9, that input resonances are shifted by amounts not exceeding perceptual limens, in an average sense, if Δ is within an estimated ± 6 dB of a step-size ΔOPT(which minimizes the mean-square-quantization error in the delta modulation of{x_{r}}). The fact that yris a summation of r binary quantities makes the computation of Y(f) much simpler than that of X(f), in general; specifically Y(f) can be computed without any multiply operations. Therefore, in problems where the power spectrum is the desired end result (for example, in the visual monitoring of formant frequencies in speech) Y(f) can provide a useful and simply computed approximation to the input spectrum. With such special applications in mind, we consider the problem of implementing a Y(f) analyzer, and note two specific analyzer configurations."
"In digital-processing techniques designed to remove room coloration from acoustic tests a short intense sound source is desirable. A spark discharge proves very suitable and this paper describes parameters influencing the design of such a generator."
"An interactive automatic speaker verification system has been augmented to include linear prediction parameters in addition to the already existing pitch and intensity analysis of sentence-long utterances. This improved system has been evaluated on a new and enlarged speaker population. A method for selecting optimum speaker-dependent features has been incorporated in this system which significantly improves its performance. The evaluation indicates that verification error rate is approximately 1 percent with respect to casual impostors and 4 percent with respect to well-trained mimics."

"The fast convolution procedure for processing discrete data requires that a transform of the data and the filter pulse response be formed, followed by the inverse transform of their (complex) product. The finite field fast transform eliminates any roundoff error due to internal multiplication, eliminates truncation of irrational coefficients, and requires only real arithmetic (addition and multiplication). This note develops a realization scheme for such a transform using the Chinese remainder theorem."
"A detailed description is given of the areas in the parameter plane where limit-cycles are possible in a second-order digital filter with one magnitude-truncation quantizer. It is shown that in those points for which limit-cycles can exist the possibility of occurrence is small. A method is described for breaking down these remaining limit-cycles."
"A special floating point arithmetic technique for fast Fourier transform (FFT) processors has been developed. The implementation of a high-speed pipeline FFT matched filter using the method employs significantly fewer components than a fixed-point processor with an equivalent performance level. The special floating point process avoids the nonlinear effects of fixed-point processors while achieving performance levels of traditional floating point arithmetic. Computer simulations were used to examine the performance of the system for linear FM pulse compression under a variety of conditions. In a specific case, with 8 bits plus sign quantization of the complex I- and Q-mantissa words in the processor and a 12-stage (4096-coefficient) FFT convolver, the mean square error (MSE) of the sidelobes relative to the peak from a single point target was less than -70 dB. Changes in waveform duration and sampling rate had negligible effect on the error level. This error characteristic can be treated as a computational or self noise, added to the input thermal noise of the radar receiver. Quantization artifacts or noise peaks which occur at levels consistent with the mantissa quantization are below levels (-50 dB for 8 bits plus sign) which would normally cause difficulty in an operational system."
 "Several alternate sets of parameters that represent the linear predictor are investigated as transmission parameters for linear predictive speech compression systems. Although each of these sets provides equivalent information about the linear predictor, their properties under quantization are different. The results of a comparative study of the various parameter sets are reported. Specifically it is concluded that the reflection coefficients are the best set for use as transmission parameters. A more detailed investigation of the reflection coefficients is then carried out using a spectral sensitivity measure. A method of optimally quantizing the reflection coefficients is derived using a minimax spectral error criterion and the sensitivity analysis. The method consists of transforming the reflection coefficients to the so-called log area ratios and linearly quantizing them. A qualitative study on changes in pole locations due to quantization serves to corroborate the use of this optimal quantization. An optimal bit allocation strategy for the transmission parameters is also presented. The use of another spectral sensitivity measure renders logarithms of the ratios of normalized errors associated with linear predictors of successive orders as the optimal quantization parameters. Informal listening tests indicate that the use of log area ratios for quantization leads to better synthesis than the use of log error ratios."
"Interactive graphics processors have recently been included as standard components of several low-cost minicomputer systems. We describe techniques which enable fast reduction and display of multiintensity speech spectrograms on such systems."
"This paper is based upon a presentation given at the 1974 Arden House Digital Signal Processing Workshop. The presentation discussed a method for designing two-dimensional recursive digital filters using a differential correction algorithm. A brief description of the algorithm and some design examples will be presented here. This design approach is compared to a similar approach used by Bednar and Farmer [1]."
"It is shown that for nonrecursive digital filters in the first canonic form the hardware requirements are proportional to the output rate. Using a low output rate, a relatively simple receiver for multifrequency-code (MFC) signals can be achieved. Linear phase bandpass pairs with a 90° phase difference are used to eliminate the input signal phase dependence. Narrow linear phase bandpass filters with even and odd symmetric impulse response are compared with filters with no phase constraints. It turns out that linear phase filters are almost as good as filters without phase constraints and that 8 bits are enough for the filter coefficients. Some aspects of the design of a digital receiver for PCM-encoded MFC signals are discussed."
"An algorithm is proposed for extracting the pitch of voiced speech. The method is based on approximating a given segment of the speech waveform in a least-squares sense by a finite Fourier series. In the approximation the fundamental frequency of the Fourier series, as well as its coefficients, is considered variable."
"A normalized digital filter structure is presented, based upon an orthonormal polynomial expansion. This structure is recursively designed, has several predictable stability properties in the presence of time-varying parameters, and appears to have roundoff noise properties which are superior to other known filter structures, particularly in the presence of clustered poles. Each section of the filter can be precisely implemented by one complex multiply."

 "The application of the coherence function between two wide-sense stationary random processes is considered, including methods for linear and nonlinear system analysis, measuring signal-to-noise ratio, and determining time delay. Examples of misleading results owing to improper model identification and biased estimation are presented. Estimation of coherence is studied with emphasis on how practical estimation errors such as bias can be reduced. The application of the partitioned modified chirp-Z transform (PAM-CZT) for fine frequency analysis in limited bands is considered as a vehicle for reducing certain types of bias."
"Linear prediction (LP) is presented as a spectral modeling technique in which the signal spectrum is modeled by an all-pole spectrum. The method allows for arbitrary spectral shaping in the frequency domain, and for modeling of continuous as well as discrete spectra (such as filter bank spectra). In addition, using the method of selective linear, prediction, all-pole modeling is applied to selected portions of the spectrum, with applications to speech recognition and speech compression. LP is compared with traditional analysis-by-synthesis (AbS) techniques for spectral modeling. It is found that linear prediction offers computational advantages over AbS, as well as better modeling properties if the variations of the signal spectrum from the desired spectral model are large. For relatively smooth spectra and for filter bank spectra, AbS is judged to give better results. Finally, a sub-optimal solution to the problem of all-zero modeling using LP is given."
"The design of optimum interpolators for band-limited sequences is considered. Newly found properties of these interpolators are discussed and used to simplify the design."
"When a fast Fourier transform (FFT) is implemented on a digital machine, quantization errors will arise due to finite word lengths in the digital system. The magnitudes and characteristics of these errors must be known if an FFT is to be designed with the minimum word lengths needed for acceptable performance. Two forms of FFT quantization, coefficient rounding and floating point arithmetic quantization, are analyzed in this paper. A theory is presented from which several new results can be obtained. The error characteristics of FFT's using exact and truncated values for the coefficients 1 and -j are found to be roughly equivalent. The accuracy of the theory is tested by computer simulations. Using the models introduced in this paper, new and accurate models can be derived to model quantization errors in high-speed convolution filters."
  "Speech amplitude, low-pass (below 1 kHz) and high-pass (above 1 kHz) zero-crossing rates were represented as weighted sums of orthonormal functions. The weighting coefficients were used to identify unknown speakers. For a ten speaker population recognition rates as high as 96.6 percent were obtained using the same data for training and testing."
"The controlled-source seismic reflection method using a so-called \"swept-frequency\" requires the application of a digital matched filter in the data preprocessing. The filter is of the swept-frequency form and it is normally long. With a 125 Hz aliasing frequency, 4 ms-sampled filters can commonly consists of up to 5000 samples. For the professor unfortunate enough to not possess a hard-wire correlator in his computer, the application of the matched filter is almost prohibitively time consuming and costly. The subject algorithm ignores any end tapering of the filter, and it concentrates only on the positions of the filter peaks and troughs. The computational savings to be realized can be around an order of magnitude, with essentially no loss in accuracy resulting."
"Nonrecursive, finite impulse response (FIR) digital filters are known to require a reduced rate of arithmetic operations relative to recursive infinite impulse response filters (IIR) in many applications where the sample rate is to be diminished. FIR symmetry and the absence of state variables contribute to the efficiency. A significant further economy in both arithmetic and memory space can be achieved by realizing the desired filter as a cascade of FIR stages, with interstage decimation of sample rate. In this paper, an approach to optimally allocate (i.e., factor) the composite decimation among filter stages (and hence determine the filter state characteristics) is described."
"Several advantages are observed in designing recursive band-pass digital filter structures according to a bandpass transformation that is incorporated directly in the structure. In particular, it is shown that such structures can be implemented with fewer multiplies than in conventional designs and in some cases, with shorter coefficient word lengths."
"The purpose of this paper is to use some recent work by the author on nonlinear minimax optimization to derive an efficient algorithm for the minimax optimization problem. This is followed by the application of the algorithm to the problem of choosing the coefficients of a recursive digital filter to meet arbitrary design specifications on the magnitude or the group delay characteristics."
"The generation of pitches of an equally tempered musical scale through nonbinary frequency division is explored, including an analysis of the resulting frequency errors. Useful approximations to 21/12, in addition to the well known 196/185 ratio, are sought. A criterion for allowable errors is developed and applied to ratios involving integers up to 10 000. Based on an optimum tuning algorithm, it is determined that there are other possible ratios that could be implemented more simply and at a lower cost than the 196/185 ratio."

"Designs of symmetric Hilbert transformers are shown to be easily derived from corresponding designs for symmetric half-band low-pass filters, and vice versa. The latter filter type is particularly useful for interpolation or smoothing in sample-rate alteration."
"Digital processing of signals, especially fast Fourier transform (FFT) hardware, has reemphasized the role of energy detectors in spectrum analysis. The cost associated with the size of words in special-purpose computers causes a search for methods of representing detected data effectively with a modest number of bits for either further processing or display. A method of accomplishing a reduction in word size is proposed here as a variable law detector. The variable law detector algorithm is described in detail and the detectability performance as a function of the detector parameters is given."
"Two new digital speech analysis methods for sequentially identifying the coefficients of the linear prediction model are presented; the methods are based on the stochastic approximation and Kalman filter sequential estimation algorithms. Speech synthesized using the predictor coefficients identified by the Kalman filter algorithm is highly intelligible and comparable in quality to that obtained by the autocorrelation and covariance methods. Speech synthesized using predictor coefficients identified by the stochastic approximation algorithm is also highly intelligible but of lower quality. The analysis and synthesis procedures use hand-picked pitch and voiced/unvoiced information, and the predictor coefficients are converted to PARCOR coefficients for checking stability and transmission to the receiver. The sequential techniques are shown to be real-time feasible and closely related to the more familiar autocorrelation and covariance methods for speech analysis."
"The side wall of the human vocal tract yields and vibrates in response to contained sound pressure. This motion influences the acoustic resonances of the vocal tract and the vibratory behavior of the vocal cords. Accurate computer modeling of the cord/tract system therefore requires knowledge of the mechanical impedance of the yielding walls. Heretofore this factor has only been estimated indirectly from sound wave measurements. We describe here a technique for direct measurement of the wall impedance. We also give a rationale for interpreting the low-frequency impedance in terms of a simple mass, compliance, viscous-loss combination. Finally, we give mechanical parameters for the vocal-tract wall which we presently use in computer simulations."
"Zero-crossing analysis techniques have long been applied to speech analysis, to automatic speech recognition, and to many other signal-processing and pattern-recognition tasks. In this paper, a mathematical formulation for each of several zero-crossing feature extraction techniques is derived and related (where possible) to each of the other zero-crossing methods. Based upon this mathematical formulation, a physical interpretation of each analysis technique is effected, as is a discussion of the properties of each method. It is shown that four of these methods are a description of a short-time waveform in which essentially the same information is preserved. Each turns out to be a particular normalization of a count of zero-crossing intervals method. The effects of the various forms of normalization are discussed. A fifth method is shown to be a different type of measure; one which preserves information concerning the duration of zero-crossing intervals rather than their absolute number. Although reference is made as to how each of the zero-crossing methods has been applied to automatic speech recognition, an attempt is made to enumerate general characteristics of each of the techniques so as to make the mathematical analysis generally applicable."
"This correspondence describes an analytical approach to the design of nonrecursive digital filters where Chebyshev functions are used to obtain filter transfer characteristics with equiripple behavior in both the passband and stopband. The resulting filters are of length 2npns+ 1 compared with optimal filters of length 2(np+ ns) - 1."

 "In the cascade realization of fixed-point digital filters under dynamic range constraints, the output noise due to accumulation of roundoff errors is highly dependent upon the order of the sections. For recursive filters it also depends on the pole-zero pairing that forms the individual second-order sections. The output noise may vary over several orders of magnitude for different cascade realizations of high-order filters. Therefore an optimization procedure to find a good ordering and pairing is very desirable. We propose a heuristic optimization procedure for finding a \"near optimal\" solution. The procedure is completely automatic and does not require any knowledgeable judgment. The number of function evaluations required for a filter of N-cascaded sections is proportional to N2. By using this procedure, \"near optimal\" solutions have been found for a 22nd-order recursive filter in 23 s, and for a 55th-order nonrecursive filter in 37.5 s, on an IBM 360-91 computer."
"An algorithm for the time domain approximation of discrete systems with a recursion is described. The algorithm iterates towards a solution minimizing the sum of squared differences between the desired and the actual output. Convergence is guaranteed. The scheme is applied to the design of low-pass filters by time domain approximation. The results compare well with other design strategies. We have extended the algorithm to two dimensions. This algorithm is essentially the same iterative scheme used for the one-dimensional case. The two-dimensional iteration achieves better results than the currently used two-dimensional filter synthesis techniques since the starting point of the iteration is the solution of the latter approach. Usually, a few iterations suffice to improve the solution in a satisfactory amount. Convergence is also guaranteed. An example of two-dimensional impulse response approximation is also given as an illustration."
  "A parser for a speech understanding system is described. The parser uses a best-first strategy in which alternative paths are assigned priorities and paths are suspended as long as there is a higher priority alternative to explore. Discussions are included on the types of steps in a parse, the assignment of priorities, cooperation among competing parses, and experimental results."
"In this paper a general theory of multistage decimators and interpolators for sampling rate reduction and sampling rate increase is presented. A set of curves and the necessary relations for optimally designing multistage decimators is also given. It is shown that the processes of decimation and interpolation are duals and therefore the same set of design curves applies to both problems. Further, it is shown that highly efficient implementations of narrow-band finite impulse response (FIR) filters can be obtained by cascading the processes of decimation and interpolation. Examples show that the efficiencies obtained are comparable to those of recursive elliptic filter designs."

"As analysis performed on a proposed special purpose hearing aid yields data on single-sidebanded voice zero-crossing rates extracted by a phase-locked loop (PLL), and also data on the logarithmically compressed voltage analog of the zero-crossing rate. The PLL demodulation is shown to correspond well with first and second formats of the eight vowels analyzed. Three fricatives were also investigated."
"An error in a Maxwell stress tensor integral of the previous publication is identified, and two new volume and surface integration methods are presented as a check on the original lumped parameter electromechanical formulation.

"In previous papers it has been demonstrated that a class of digital filter structures derived from the theory of orthogonal polynomials has practical utility in digital signal processing problems. In this paper the specific algorithms necessary to synthesize and scale these structures in fixed-point arithmetic (based upon L2norm scaling) are presented and implemented as Fortran programs."
"The roundoff noise characteristics of three digital filter structures derived from the theory of orthogonal polynomials are studied and compared to the two standard forms, the direct and parallel forms. Both theoretical and experimental results are presented. It is shown that in terms of roundoff noise, the worst of the orthogonal filter forms (the two-multiplier lattice form) is superior to the direct form, and that the best (the normalized or ladder form) is nearly equal to or superior to the parallel form. The normalized form is shown to be vastly superior to the parallel form when filters with clustered poles are designed."
"This paper describes the acoustic processing in a syntactically guided natural language speech understanding system. A major characteristic of this system is that through the interaction of pragmatic, semantic, and syntactic information, candidate words are proposed to exist at specific points in the acoustic stream. The purpose of the acoustic processor is to verify or reject these hypotheses. This verification is done in two stages. First, digital filtering is done to classify each 10-ms segment as one of ten primitive classes. If the proposed word is consistent with the pattern of primitive classes at the corresponding point in the acoustic stream, further analysis is done using linear predictive coding and other digital filters. The results of this analysis are used to segment the acoustic signal and to further classify the voiced segments. Because this segmentation and classification can be tailored for each word, difficult analysis problems caused by coarticulation between adjacent sounds can be successfully solved. When combined with a sophisticated linguistic processor, these acoustical processing methods yield correct understanding of natural language utterances."
"This paper describes the structure of the second version of the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) speech understanding system and presents the data gathered on its performance. The system is distinctive in the way that knowledge from various sources is coordinated by a \"best-first\" parser to predict the sequence of words in an utterance, and in the use of word functions-programs that represent the acoustic characteristics of a word-to test the predictions."
"In an earlier paper Crochiere and Rabiner [1] discuss the theory of using finite impulse response (FIR) digital filters for signal decimation, interpolation, and filtering. In this paper we expand on the ideas presented in the earlier paper on implementing narrow-band designs efficiently. It is shown how, using the techniques of decimation and interpolation, a desired narrow-band filter can be realized with a greatly reduced number of multiplications per second in the realization over standard direct form implementations. Further, it is shown that the proposed implementation can have less roundoff noise and less severe coefficient sensitivity problems than a standard direct form implementation. Several examples are presented to illustrate the applicability of this implementation to practical design problems."
 "A fast method for calculating the BIFORE phase spectrum for different circular shifts of the input data is developed. A simple relationship between the BIFORE phase spectrum and the modified Hadamard transform (MHT) coefficients is established. It is also pointed out that given the BIFORE power spectrum and the phase spectrum for circular shifts of 0 to (N/2 - 1), the input data can be reconstructed."
"In this correspondence we consider the stability of the Shank's least mean-square inverse design technique for the synthesis of two-dimensional recursive digital filters and show that this process always produces filters satisfying conditions necessary and sufficient for stability in one dimension. We do not answer the complete stability question, but provide a necessary condition in order for this process to generate stable filters."
"The Lpand lpnorms are continuous functions of the parameter p. The monotonic properties of four norms most commonly used in engineering are discussed."
"The Lpscaling techniques of Jackson are reviewed, and the lpscaling techniques are defined; then the properties of the Lpand lpnorms are discussed and compared. The l2norm scaling is proposed as the most convenient method in the state-space digital filtering."
"Two new methods based on a nonuniform acoustic tube model of the vocal tract are developed: a method for estimating the lip impedance zeros and poles directly from the speech wave and a method for computing the area function noniteratively from given lip impedance singularities."
"Changes in the Hadamard transform of a vector are investigated under two conditions: 1) shifting the elements of the vector cyclically for 2lplaces and 2) interchanging any two elements of the vector. The two-dimensional case is also investigated including shifting and interchanging of rows or columns."
"Simple graph-theoretic methods for the detection and location of delay-free loops in a digital filter configuration are outlined along with a method to develop an equivalent realization without delay-free loops."
"This paper develops necessary and sufficient conditions under which for every sequence of matrices diagonal in an orthonormal basis{u}there exists an asymptotically equivalent sequence in the class of matrices diagonal in some other basis{\\upsilon}. These conditions can be expressed in terms of a doubly stochasticN \\times Nmatrix A whose entries Aijare the square magnitudes of the inner product between the ith basis vector of{\\upsilon}and thejthbasis vector of{\\upsilon}. We show that a sufficient condition for asymptotic equivalence is\\lim\\min{N \\rightarrow \\infin}[1-\\frac{1}{N}tr(A^{T}A)] = 0and a necessary condition is\\lim\\min{N\\rightarrow\\infin}[tr(A^{T}A)]^{-1} = 0. This paper also discusses the implications of these results to real-time signal processing whereby it is the prevailing practice to approximate the actual input correlation matrix by matrices which are diagonal in a computationally more manageable basis."
"Due to adder overflow, different stationary output signals can be obtained from a digital filter for the same input signal. This phenomenon is discussed for a second-order recursive digital filter, resulting in a definition of stability of a digital system with respect to a certain input signal. A necessary and sufficient condition for unique steady-state solutions for a filter using a saturation characteristic is given. It is indicated that this condition is also a necessary condition for any other possible overflow characteristic. For a class of overflow characteristics, sufficient conditions for unique solutions are derived. These sufficient conditions are in general not necessary, but the necessity of these conditions is proven for one specific nonlinear characteristic."
"We demonstrate that phase accuracy is extremely important in image processing filters and express the hope that more work will be done on the development of filter design techniques which use phase as well as magnitude specifications."
"The equivalent continuous-time transfer functionH(z)|_{z=e}^{j\\omegaT}of a linear discrete-time system may be evaluated using standard Bode plot techniques. The utility of these techniques is extended in this paper through a frequency-scale warping of the Bode plot and a mapping from thezplane to polar coordinates (rather than the more commonly used Cartesian coordinates) in thewplane. These graphical techniques may also be used in the preliminary synthesis of a desired transfer function. Examples are included to illustrate the use of these techniques."
"A new approach to the hardware implementation of high-speed processors dedicated to perform the fast Fourier transform (FFT) in real time is presented. This approach capitalizes on recent advances in semiconductor memory technology to eliminate conventional multipliers, and is shown to offer significant reductions in hardware complexity and power consumption. It also yields a highly modular hardware configuration. A modified floating-point arithmetic is incorporated to allow a wider dynamic range. Using standard available TTL integrated circuits, a throughput of complex data points at a 25 MHz word rate is possible."
"A theorem regarding the evaluation of discrete transforms recently proven by Rader is generalized to give a lower bound on the number of digits required to evaluate a z transform for arbitrary radix."
  "Presents the front cover/table of contents for this issue of the periodical."
"A general theory of epoch extraction of overlapping nonidentical waveforms is presented. The theory is applied to outputs of models of voiced speech production mechanism and to actual speech data. Some typical glottal waveshapes are considered to explain their effect on the speech output. It is shown that the points of excitation of the vocal tract can be precisely identified for continuous speech. It is possible to obtain accurate pitch information by this method even for high-pitched sounds. The epoch extraction has wide applications in speech analysis, speaker verification, speech synthesis, and pitch perception studies."
"A recent class of continuous transforms is generalized to give an infinite number of new transforms. A frequency interpretation of the transform base functions gives fast generalized transform (FGT) matrices using standard digit reversal techniques. Examples of FGT factorizations are given. Advantages of the generalized transforms include continuous transform properties for system design and analysis and FGT algorithms for practical applications using digital hardware."

"The adders and multipliers of a wave digital filter (WDF) can be grouped into n-port building blocks called adaptors. Various aspects concerning the realization of adaptors are discussed. These include the minimization of the number of adders, the replacement of parallel adaptors by series adaptors and vice versa, possibilities for combining ideal transformers with adaptors without requiring inverse multipliers, and the realization of adaptors with arbitrary numbers of ports by means of elementary adaptors."
"In this paper a nonlinear smoothing algorithm recently proposed by Tukey is described and evaluated for speech processing applications. Simple linear smoothing routines generally fail to provide adequate smoothing for data which exhibit both local roughness and sharp discontinuities. The proposed nonlinear smoothing algorithm can effectively smooth such data by using a combination of median smoothing routines and linear filtering. The concept of double smoothing is introduced as a refinement on the smoothing algorithm. Examples of the application of the nonlinear smoothing methods to typical speech parameters are included in this paper."
"The purpose of this paper is to describe a technique for semiautomatically determining the pitch contour of an utterance. The method is significantly more sophisticated than the standard technique of hand tracking of pitch periods from a waveform display of the utterance and leads to a fairly robust measurement of the pitch period. This technique utilizes a simultaneous display (on a 10 ms section-by-section basis) of the low-pass filtered waveform, the autocorrelation of a 400- point segment of the low-pass filtered waveform, and the cepstrum of the same 400-point segment of the wideband recording. For each of the separate displays (i.e., waveform, autocorrelation, and cepstrum) an independent estimate of the pitch period is made on an interactive basis with the computer, and the final pitch period decision is made by the user based on results of each of the measurements. The technique has been tested on a large number of utterances spoken by a variety of speakers with very good results. Formal tests of the method were made in which four people were asked to use the method on three different utterances, and their results were then compared. During voiced regions, the standard deviation in the value of the pitch period was about 0.5 samples across the four people. The standard deviation of the location of the time at which voiced regions became unvoiced, and vice versa was on the order of half a section duration, or 5 ms. The major limitation of the proposed method is that it requires about 30 min to analyze 1 s of speech. However, the increased accuracy and robustness of the results indicate that the tradeoff of time for accuracy is a good one for many applications."

  "The following report is based on information provided by the IEEE (R. Emberson's TAB office). IEEE Headquarters acts as the bursar for our Groups and Societies in IEEE. The Group's income consists of membership fees, support from the IEEE, interest, sales of Transactions and conference proceedings, IEEE Press sales of books written for our Group, meeting profits, and other income. Expenses are incurred by the Transactions, by the Newsletter, by miscellaneous periodical expenses, nonperiodical expenses, meetings, IEEE staff administration, IEEE Headquarters service to the AdCom, Adcom external costs, and other expenses. Income for 1974 exceeded expenses by about $22,600, but income for 1975 is expected to only equal expenses. (This reduction in out profit for 1975 is the result of an increase in the anticipated number and cost of pages published in the Transactions in 1975.)

"The history of the development of infrared detectors is briefly reviewed. The parameters describing the performance of detectors are described and the measurement procedures outlined. Recent developments in intrinsic HgCdTe and PbSnTe, extrinsic silicon, and pyroelectric detectors are reviewed. Several applications of detector technology to specific remote sensing problems are discussed."
"Techniques for fabricating single-crystal and thin-film detector arrays for infrared remote sensing have been developed in the last few years in most advanced solid-state laboratories. Arrays of photovoltaic devices have been prepared by liquid-phase epitaxy and vapor transport, and by the formation of metal-semiconductor structures and by proton bombardment. A great improvement in infrared thin-film devices was also achieved in the last few years by the vacuum deposition of epitaxial and polycrystalline films. A new technique to obtain high-quality middle-infrared detector arrays has been developed by the use of RF sputtering. Ternary chalcogenide layers with interesting properties for fabricating multi-element detector arrays have been obtained by an RF multicathode sputtering. PbxSn1-xTe films, with a composition-dependent energy gap, have been deposited employing an RF multicathode sputtering system capable of simultaneous and sequential sputtering at different rates from three different targets. Single-crystal and polycrystalline films have been investigated in the course of developing bidimensional detector arrays. Heteroepitaxial films of PbxSn1-xTe at substrate temperatures lower than that needed in conventional evaporation techniques have been obtained using NaCl and BaF2substrates. Moreover, epitaxial films with electrical properties close to the best single-crystal values have been obtained on germanium substrates. Using the cosputtering technique, it has been possible to obtain n-type and p-type layers just by controlling the quantity of excess metal or tellurium, respectively. Polycrystalline photoconductive detectors deposited by RF sputtering have shown responsivity and detectivity values higher than previously reported. Exceptionally high responsivity values have been obtained-better than 106V/W in PbTe films and 480 V/W in Pb0.85Sn0.15Te films. Peak detectivities Dλ*(4.5 µ, 800, 1) > 8 × 1010cm ċ Hz1/2/W in PbTe detectors and Dλ*(8.5 µ, 800, 1) > 109cm ċ Hz1/2/W in PbxSn1-xTe detectors have been measured with a 2π-steradian field of view at an operating temperature of 77 K. These results are particularly important for the films deposited on germanium and silicon substrates, because of the easy incorporation of electronic readout elements into a completely integrated thermal vision system. Performance data are presented for blackbody and spectral detectivity, impedance, noise, and time constants. Distributions of measured data for linear staggered detector arrays are reported."
"Photovoltaic detectors of Pb1-xSnxTe, sensitive in the 8- 14-µm spectral region, with near-theoretical performance characteristics, have been fabricated by a surface inversion technique. These detectors have exhibited quantum efficiencies of up to 45 percent limited by surface reflection), zero-bias resistance-area products of 21 Ωċcm2and background-limited detectivities of 1.5 × 1011cm ċ Hz1/2/W. A theoretical model consistent with experimental results is presented. Such high-performance devices are useful in guidance, reconnaissance, surveillance, ranging, and communication systems."
"A new type of 1.06-µm solid-state detector is discussed, the inverted hetrojunction III-V alloy mesa photodiode, which offers quantum efficiencies near 1.00 percent, extremely low capacitance and transit time, and low dark currents. The characterstics of these detectors allow their use in sensitive 1.06-µm optical receivers which promise better signal-to-noise ratios in a number of applications than any other available 1.06-µm photodetector. In particular, an optimization procedure for selecting photodiode and preamplifier parameters to give the best signal-to-noise ratio under signal conditions is discussed and this technique is applied to a proposed system application. It is shown that in this laser-illuminated airborne night imaging system, a small area heterojunction III-V alloy photodiode detector in an optimized receiver should be able to give signal-to-noise ratios much higher than any other 1.06-µm detector approach, even though the other 1.06-µm detectors may have lower noise equivalent power (NEP) values than this receiver. This is an illustration of the fact that such \"magic numbers\" for detector comparision as NEP are applicable only to comparing similar types of detectors in certain specific types of applications (such as comparing IR photoconductors in a high background application), and are of very little value in determining the relative performance of different types of detectors for a given system application (such as comparing photomultipliers, avalanche photodiodes, and low-noise photodiodes for this application)."
"A unified treatment of the basic electrostatic and dynamic design of charge-coupled devices (CCD's) based on approximate analytical analysis is presented. Clocking methods and tradeoffs are discussed. Driver power dissipation and on-chip power dissipation are analyzed. Properties of noise sources due to charge input and transfer are summarized. Low-noise methods of signal extraction are discussed in detail. The state of the art for linear and area arrays is presented. Tradeoffs in area-array performance from a systems point of view and performance predictions are presented in detail. Time delay and integration (TDI) and the charge-injection device (CID) are discussed. Finally, the uses of the charge-coupled concept in infrared imaging are discussed."
"A review of infrared sensitive charge-coupled devices (IRCCD) is presented. Operational requirements of typical IRCCD applications are briefly introduced. IRCCD devices are divided into two major categories: a) Monolithic devices, which essentially extend the original CCD concept into the IR. Monolithic IRCCD's discussed include inversion-mode devices (with narrow bandgap semiconductor substrate), accumulation-mode devices (extrinsic wide bandgap semiconductor substrate), and Schottky-barrier devices (internal photoemission), b) Hybrid devices, in which the functions of detection and signal processing are performed in separate but integratable components by an array of IR detectors and a silicon CCD shift register unit. Hybrid IRCCD's discussed include both direct injection devices (in conjunction with photovoltaic IR detectors) and indirect injection devices (in conjunction with pyroelectric and photoconductive devices)."
"Radiation from remotely sensed objects in the earth's environment is attenuated in its passage through the atmosphere. In the infrared region of the spectrum, this is caused, for clear-sky conditions, mainly through absorption by atmospheric molecular species, i.e., the atmospheric gases. Molecular absorption is characterized by a highly variable, more-or-less random, frequency dependence which is difficult, if not impossible, to describe analytically in detail. On the other hand, most experimental work requiring an understanding of atmospheric attenuative phenomena is accomplished with instrumental spectral resolutions that are coarse enough to smooth out much of the spectral detail in molecular line structure. Therefore, methods are described for calculating atmospheric transmittance and radiance to correspond to spectral resolutions of those instruments used in remote sensing. These methods involve either numerical integration of the exact line structure over the desired spectral interval, or the use of band models derived from artificially created line structure. Limitations of these calculations are discussed in the light of factors such as the fidelity of model atmospheres used to simulate real ones and the utility of different routines regarding computer time and accuracy. A short section covers the effect of scattering."
"Optical mechanical scanners offer a means for producing imagery from earth orbiting platforms in many wavelength bands simultaneously ranging from the visible to about 13 µm. Since the signal is in electrical form, it can be telemetered to earth where the spectral content of each scene element can be processed to classify features based on their spectral properties. Optical mechanical scanners, electron beam imagery systems, and electronic self-scanning detector arrays are being developed as imaging systems for earth observation from satellites. NASA convened a working group to evaluate the role of these imagers in earth observation programs and assess R&D requirements for future systems. Some of the system design considerations prepared by the electromechanical scanner panel for use by this working group are presented."
"Remote sensing is the process of acquiring information from the environment by the use of a sensor that is not in physical contact with the object under study. The military services are experienced practitioners of this old, but newly glamorous, art. Their accomplishments in the infrared, that region lying between visible light on the one hand and microwaves on the other, are both impressive and of increasing importance. Our purpose is to provide an overview of these accomplishments. We begin with a brief treatment of the characteristics and peculiarities of the infrared portion of the spectrum and of the sensors that operate there. Early military experience with remote sensing by infrared is described and an applications matrix is developed in order to provide a perspective from which the reader can view the full panorama of military applications. Specific applications ate discussed. These include strategic systems for early warning of intercontinental ballistic missile launches, methods for the detection of atmospheric contaminants, such as poison gas, under field conditions, aids for the precision delivery of weaponry (including passive, active, and laser designator guidance techniques), and sensor systems for reconnaissance and surveillance. Wherever possible, details of sensor performance are given."
"Thermal infrared images provide information about the near-surface physical state of geologic materials, particularly, the density, water content, and heat transfer. Nonterrestrial planetary studies, conducted at fairly coarse resolution, have been useful primarily in determining the distribution of rock fragments. Terrestrial studies, conducted from satellite and aircraft at coarse to fine resolutions, have been successful for monitoring effusive volcanism, delineating areas of steaming altered ground and hot-spring activity, detecting fractures expressed hydrologically and topographically, and distinguishing a variety of geologic materials with physical and compositional differences. Interpretation of thermal images is complicated by the various types of physical processes involved and commonly requires an assessment of many different factors. A simple theoretical model was used in this analysis to provide quantitative assessment of some of these factors, to predict optimum times to acquire thermal data, and to determine quantitative values of various properties of terrian. Two geologic applications were studied in some detail: geothermal mapping and thermal inertia mapping. Initial results indicate that both techniques have considerable potential, especially in reconnaissance studies. These data were acquired under optimal meteorological conditions and at sites where the geologic materials were well exposed. A realistic assessment of the limitations of these techniques must await future studies."
"Thermal infrared scanners with multiple channels in the 8-14-µm wavelength region are important for geological remote sensing because this spectral region contains important compositional information about silicate rocks and minerals that cannot be duplicated by remote sensors operating elsewhere in the electromagnetic spectrum. Emittance minima in this spectral region, caused by interatomic oscillations, occur at different wavelengths depending on silicate rock type. It has been demonstrated that an image constructed from a signal that is proportional to a ratio of radiances in two thermal scanner channels can be used to map compositional (chemical and mineral) variations in silicates, while suppressing temperature variations across a scanned scene. Theoretical studies indicate that future infrared scanners with eight to twelve channels in the 8-14-µm region might be used to produce an image that could be simply level-sliced (divided into discrete gray levels) to map silicate rocks according to traditional rock classification charts. This is a field in which sensor technology is still the limiting factor. However, improvements in extrinsic sensor properties, especially an increase in the number of spatially coregistered detector elements in a single dewar, are more important than improvements in intrinsic properties, such as detectivity."
"Satellites provide meteorologists with a data source unmatched at comparable spatial and temporal coverage by any existing or practical alternate source. There are limitations, however, both instrumental and fundamental, imposed on the achievable resolution and accuracy. Current and promising future contributions to meteorology from satellite-borne sensors are discussed, with emphasis on performance and the limitations thereto. The discussion covers 1) synoptic meteorology where satellite observations of clouds provide measures of winds, cyclogenesis, and rainfall estimation; 2) atmospheric profiling wherein vertical profiles of temperature, humidity, and certain gaseous constituents are provided; 3) radiation budget or the energy exchange between the earth and the space-sun environment; and 4) surface features of importance to meteorology-temperature, soil moisture, and sea ice coverage. Satellites will be extensively used as data collectors and relays from in situ instruments on buoys, balloons, and fixed earth sites. The accuracy and coverage of such observations, however, will be determined by the in situ sensors and not by the satellite. They are therefore not discussed here."
"Skylab multispectral scanner data, digitized Skylab color infrared (IR) photography, digitized Skylab black and white multiband photography, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) multi-spectral scanner data collected within a 24-h time period over an area in south-central Indiana near Bloomington on June 9 and 10, 1973, were compared in a machine-aided land use analysis of the area. The overall classification performance results, obtained with nine land use classes, were 87-percent correct classification using the \"best\" 4 channels of the Skylab multispectral scanner, 80 percent for the channels on the Skylab multispectral scanner which are spectrally comparable to the ERTS multispectral scanner, 88 percent for the ERTS multispectral scanner, 83 percent for the digitized color IR photography, and 76 percent for the digitized black and white multiband photography. The results indicate that the Skylab multispectral scanner may yield even higher classification accuracies when a noise filtered multispectral scanner data set becomes available in the near future."
"A summary description of the status of electrooptical (EO) systems is given. Performance equations and parameters affecting the design of an EO system are given. Typical performance-cost tradeoff analysis is discussed. The system transfer functions, noise, sensitivity, resolutions, fields of view, and other practical considerations are discussed. Factors affecting cost of an electrooptical system are described. Some cost data of typical EO components are given. The impact of new technology on future potential growth of EO systems is discussed and, finally, some of the areas needed for future basic research are discussed."
"Two recurrence schemes are given for finding Amin Tn(ax + b) = Σm=0nAmTm(x) for given n, a, and b, where Tm(x)= cos (m arccos x). This problem arises in the calculation of feeding coefficients to produce optimum beam patterns in the design of certain linear arrays."
"A fast algorithm is presented for a two-dimensional transform of a data matrix such as Fourier or Hadamard transforms. It can be applied to a matrix, which is too large for the main storage and is stored sequentially rowwise in an auxiliary storage. The size of the matrix may be of Rmrows and of arbitrary number of columns. Whenever R rows of working area are available in the main storage, the matrix is read out, processed, and stored back m times. This new algorithm does not require the presently used method of transposing the data matrix."
"A circuit consisting of two periodically operated switches, potentiometers, resistors, and compensated operational amplifiers, but not containing external capacitors, is proposed for the realization of a second-order bandpass and low-pass filter. The filter is electronically tunable and the natural frequency of the filter varies linearly with the width of the pulses controlling the FET switches."
"A boundedness criterion is established between the solutions of an nth-order nonlinear functional differential equation and an nth-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation."

"The purpose of this letter is to show that the product of the impedance and admittance matrices of three-conductor transmission lines is never in the form [aa,b0] or [aa,0b] when s = jω The significance of this result is discussed."
"The use of Walsh and hard-limited Fourier transforms to synthesize banks of contiguous Doppler filters is examined for the case of a 32-point transform. It is found that the former is generally inferior to the latter from the point of view of number and size of spurious sidelobes."
"The weight distributions of the (13, 6) and the (17, 8) quaternary quadratic residue codes are computed."
"In the above paper, erroneous data were obtained for some frequencies and were attributed to equipment instability. However, it is shown in this letter that the \"errors\" were due to singularities in the parameters being measured, as can be seen by examining the equations involved. Additionally, comments are made with regard to resolving the phase ambiguity in the measurement."
"The distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) breaks down near points of vanishing permittivity in fluctuating media. For plane stratified media, a modified DWBA theory based on a single realization of propagating magnetic fields rather than electric fields adequately treats resonant scattering from points of vanishing permittivity."
"A special-layered Schottky solar cell has been constructed which produces 9.5-percent sunlight efficiency over a 1-cm2area. This solar cell has a fill factor of 0.60 compared to 0.58 for a commercial p-n silicon cell. Series resistance of 5 Ω is shown to reduce the theoretical fill factor from 0.67 to 0.42 for a Schottky cell. The diode quality factor n is shown to significantly increase open-circuit voltage and yet not appreciably influence the fill factor."
"A multi-hetero-AlGaAs laser with an external waveguide to be used in the integrated optics was made. The laser action was achieved by an optical pumping, and the spectrum was narrower than that of the conventional double-hetero-AlGaAs lasers."

"The last comprehensive survey on atomic frequency standards was done by McCoubrey [1]. This survey reviews the more recent historical background of atomic frequency standards leading to the present developments. A discussion of the underlying physical and engineering principles is given. Modern atomic frequency standards, including their performance, are compared quantitatively, and projections are attempted at likely future developments and performance characteristics. As in 1966, the standards principally used in technical and scientific applications are rubidium gas cell devices, cesium beam tubes, and hydrogen maser oscillators. However, substantial advances in physical and performance characteristics can be reported. New developments include passive hydrogen devices, saturated absorption stabilized lasers, ion storage devices, and atomic beams in the far infrared and infrared region, as well as new techniques to evaluate frequency biases such as those encountered in cesium and hydrogen standards. The survey includes a discussion of the effects of past and current developments in atomic frequency standards on the technical and scientific user community."
"The most important physical parameters of the ionosphere which have been studied extensively over the years are: 1) the temperature, density, chemical composition, and directed motion (wind) of the ionized and neutral gas particles; and 2) the electric and magnetic fields. This review will discuss direct in situ techniques used on sounding rockets and satellites to measure these physical parameters. The techniques reviewed are restricted to those which are applicable to altitudes above about 100 km, where the mean free path is greater than the characteristic dimension of the instruments. Direct in situ instrumentation is defined, as far as this paper is concerned, as an experiment which measures the parameters in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle carrying the instrument; remote sensing techniques have already been reviewed elsewhere, therefore, will not be discussed here."
"The history of linear motors is a history of shape. Once having departed from the cylindrical geometry of rotating machines, a wider world of three-dimensional design becomes possible. Linear induction motors dominate the field of linear drives to the same extent as does the rotary induction machine in relation to more complicated adjustable-speed motors. It is therefore thought appropriate to devote only one section to linear motors other than induction. A fairly full treatment of electromagnetic levitation is also included together with a treatment of oscillating machines. Perhaps the most important features are the division of electrical machines into two classes which are termed \"magnetic\" and \"electromagnetic\" and the \"topological explosion\" which is at present taking place in linear motor design. Some linear machines are already well established on a commercial basis but the vast bulk of recent inventions still remain to be exploited."
"An attempt to systematically outline the work done in the area of phase-locked loops which are now used in modern communication system design is presented. The analog phase-locked loops are well documented in several books but discrete, analog-digital, and digital. phase-locked loop work is scattered. Apart from discussing the various analysis, design, and application aspects of phase-locked loops, a number of references are given in the bibliography."
"Large reflector antennas are currently fabricated by assembling a large number of small light aluminum panels onto a superstructure. A large number of aluminum-to-aluminum joints are inherently exposed to RF radiation on such an antenna. It is shown in this paper that the natural oxide layer on aluminum is of the correct thickness to permit electron tunneling through the Al-Al2O3-Al junctions. The nonlinearity due to the junctions then generates spurious signals when these antennas are used for simultaneous transmission and reception of signals at different frequencies. Moreover, the large number of junctions (rivets) on an antenna can combine to produce serious inteference in these diplexed systems."
"The use of Galilean rotating coordinates with the covariant form of the electromagnetic-field equations leads to the appearance of spurious electromagnetic-field terms, identical with terms arising from the use of Galilean coordinates for a linearly translating frame. The spurious terms will complicate the analysis of constitutive relations in rotating media."
"The transient response of free charge in a good conductor is considered from a macroscopic viewpoint. The results reemphasize the importance of the frequency dependence of conductivity in predicting charge relaxation. Moreover, the charge density exhibits an additional dependence upon the means of excitation which is consistent with relativistic principles."
"Equal-valued capacitor active RC networks due to Gopal are shown to be equivalent (except for a buffer amplifier) to those of Dutta Roy and Malik."
"The CW oscillation characteristics of GaAs Schottky-barrier gate FET's have been examined at 10 GHz. The maximum output power of 41.2 mW and the maximum efficiency of 15.6 percent have been obtained for the GaAs FET with a gate length of 1.5 µm and an electrode width of 300 µm. The experimental results have shown that the GaAs FET possesses promising features for an oscillator application as well as an amplifier application."
"The doping profile of transit-time avalanche diodes has evolved from a compromise of technological convenience and the original structure proposed by Read [1]. A technique by which the doping profile my be quickly optimized is described, and it is shown that a four-layer p-n-p-n structure should give the highest efficiency for a transit-time diode. This technique, which my be generalized to other types of device, predicts the maximum power density available from the optimum structure. For a Read-type diode, operating in X band, this is in the region of 40 kW/cm2at an efficiency of around 30 percent. Higher efficiencies are attainable at the expense of output power."
 "Methods used to obtain the parameters of the C-V law of varactor diodes are considered with reference to the effects of errors including that introduced by the finite measurement signal amplitude. It is shown that commonly used graphical techniques are unsuitable where great accuracy is required and that a nonlinear least-squares technique is preferred."
"The use of an electrooptical-waveguide modulator to achieve over 80-percent modulation of 7980-Å light from a room temperature laser diode operating at 10 mW CW is reported. The insertion loss of the modulator including couplers is 8.5 dB, and the output beam has high coherence."
"This letter discusses a fast digital technique for decomposing signals which are linear superpositions of components having the same form but different widths. This technique, based on the work of Titschmarsh, is a generalization of a method used by Gardner et al. to analyze multicomponent exponential decays."
"A new statistical model is proposed to predict the correlation function of unstructured black and white digital facsimiles. The derivation of the model could be extended to structured printed materials and is based on a first-order Markov process representation for pictures."
"Efficient small-signal modulation bandwidths of 30-40 MHz were achieved with three types of large area, small contact LED's suitable for use with optical fiber transmission lines. Much higher modulation rates are possible with about 6 dB/octave increase in drive power."
 "The rapidity of a current \"chop,\" occurring when a vacuum arc spontaneously extinguishes, is measured for a low current tungsten arc. The time required for cessation of the arc is found to be 2-5 ns. An estimate of chopping current verifies the notion that a minimal current is necessary for the existence of an arc."
"The difficult and time consuming problem of accurately finding the center of symmetry of a noisy data curve is greatly simplified by a method easily implemented on any small calculator or computer. An example, locating the resonance frequency of a microwave cavity to one part in 107, is given."

"The actual utilization of systems science, especially social systems engineering, has not measured up to the plethora of theories and examples of potential applications in the literature. To begin developing a theory of application in systems science, one may consider modeling the systems scientist as a system or consider nonsystems approaches that would include the political influence, feelings, aesthetic, and religious dimensions of both the analyst and the user. The essential ideas of this process are presented in summary form."
"Shifting socioeconomic forces have led many engineers to focus their professional attention on Societal and managerial problems, as opposed to those for which they were trained. Many of theories one carries as an engineer appear to be quite applicable to socioeconomic problems, but as several case histories show, there are subtle conditions which may prevent a direct transfer of ideas. Some guidelines for improving one's chances of successfully bringing his knowledge to bear on socioeconomic problems are suggested."
"How can a diverse free society find decision mechanisms that are logical, efficient, and timely? This is a problem that has challenged man at least from the time of Plato's Republic. We see today factions of society arguing over alternatives rather than over values or probabilities. Adversary proceedings encourage people to advocate extremes rather than a careful balance of several considerations. Decision analysis, a logical procedure for balancing the many uncertain, complex, and dynamic factors that characterize a decision, offers promise of a new and valuable procedure for social decisions. The decision analyst creates an extrapersonal explicit model of the decision under consideration. Information on possible alternatives, uncertainties, relationships, or preferences can come from different groups and still be represented within the same decision model, with the implications for the decision apparent to all. One can imagine a society where decision making has become decentralized, where distinct bodies are responsible for creating social alternatives, assessing the probabilities of various outcomes for each alternative, and setting the preferences of society. Once the alternatives, information, and preferences were established, society would make the decision using only the principles of logic. Applications to automotive pollution, hurricane seeding, and nuclear safety demonstrate the approach."
"In a cultural tradition that man not lose control over his destiny, society must be the keeper of its technology. Toward that end, society already directs specialized technical knowledge to achieve its needs and wants, employing a host of public and private institutions. First in potency among these is the federal government. There is a problem, however, of conflicts in goals, policies and institutional aspirations in a pluralistic society, and inequitable representation in the decision process, that leads to an imbalance in costs and benefits or inequities in their social distribution. Correctives may be technically strenuous, economically expensive, or politically improbable. Thus to manage technology to gain consensual outcomes, society needs to focus its preferences, develop forecasts as to expected and unexpected social and environmental consequences of technological initiatives, and inject precrisis planning into the public decision making process. Achieving these goals is the task conferred on technology assesment. Technology assessment can thus help reduce uncertainty and widen the range of options, reduce arbitrariness and expediency of solutions, limit penalties of poor choices, and improve allocation of common resources, and with public involvement, it can increase accountability. Technology assessment based on technical fact thus comprises an early warning system to shorten lags in response to problems, or alter response, by meeting deficiencies in traditional institutions created to deliver technologically based goods and service. Examples are included."
"In general outline, this paper 1)summarizes a number of what are currently thought to be our most important national problems and policy issues; 2) explains why attempts to deal with such problems in the past have often met with failure; 3) outlines in general terms what it is we must do differently if we are to have any hope of explaining and dealing more adequately with such problems; and 4) discusses the importance and the role of models in the understanding of behavior and the design of social systems. Then, many of the previous points with an example of a simple policy model are illustrated, and attempt to show that it indeed is possible to model social problems in a way that achieves useful results. The paper concludes with a few philosophical comments on the role of models in the explanation of social behavior and the design of better social systems."
"The energy problem has suddenly placed new demands on engineering education. The magnitude of the problem and its resolution through the creative application of scientific and engineering principles will no doubt require that essentially all new engineering graduates have some background in basic concepts pertaining to energy production, distribution and utilization. These three aspects of the energy problem in turn suggest the necessity for some background in relevant economics and social factors (e.g., the demand for energy to maintain present life styles) as essential for an understanding of the energy problem. To this end, a world energy model and associated computer simulation are proposed as a medium for providing engineering graduates with the required background. The model contains the essential elements of the supply/demand interaction for five major sources of energy, with intersource competition; the model, however, is of modest complexity so that students are not overwhelmed with detail. The computer program is, therefore, well suited for individual and group study of the key parameters which influence the world energy situation through interactive computer simulation. Students can thereby gain insight and understanding of the principal characteristics of the energy problem. The model is continuous (i.e., an initial value problem in ordinary differential equations), and typically runs through the 50-year period 1970-2020 via low-order Runge-Kutta numerical integration. The coding is in standard Fortran IV so that it is essentially machine independent. The program can, therefore, be readily exchanged by engineering educators."
"Interpretive structural modeling is an emerging methodology which appears to be very useful as an aid to individuals and small groups in developing an understanding of complex situations. This paper presents an introduction to the fundamental concepts and operations of the methodology and reports on the results of two exercises conducted with a group of graduate students who had minimal mathematical training. The first exercise involved the structuring of personal values and was intended to acquaint the individuals with the methodology. The second was a group exercise focusing on barriers to investment in the central city, a subject of substantive interest to the participants. The results of the exercises demonstrate the utility of the methodology for capturing and communicating individual and group perceptions regarding complex issues."
"Recent developments in urban simulation try to avoid failures of earlier models by being more open to changing problems, more aware of the social context of problems, and by paying more attention to user involvement. In this paper, a pragmatic approach is presented which combines dynamic simulation, multiattributive evaluation, and group participation. The approach consists of a combination of a multiperiod, multiregion, dynamic, digital simulation model of urban development with an evaluation model based on the multiattributive utility theory (MAUT). Iterative application of simulation and evaluation to planning alternatives by one or more planners, decision makers or interest groups leads to a learning process about the impacts of plans and the potential conflicts arising from them. The approach has been tested in a number of experimental workshops. It seems possible that the tools and procedures described in this paper form the nucleus of a municipal simulation laboratory. Work of the laboratory might follow two strategies: One would emphasize citizen involvement in group experiments, the other would attempt to simulate urban preference structures in a dynamic simulation model."
"The present paper gives a concise but self-contained treatment of optimum economic growth theory and then reformulate it to study the policy implications of the present situation of limited energy resources of various forms. The optimum energy policy so obtained is justifiable in terms of common sense, and economic principles, but is at variance with current energy policy."
"This is a survey of the theoretical and empirical models of location choice and land use in cities. The survey is conducted from a historical perspective and the models are critically evaluated in terms of their logical structure. Special attention is given to the technical difficulties created when the assumption of the convexity of the production technology is dropped. It is indicated why further progress in this area requires a fundamental rethinking of the way in which we conceptualize the behavior of individual location choice."
"This paper discusses the use of input-output models for the analyses of economic growth and resulting environmental, resource and related issues. The emphasis is on discussion of a general structure and characteristics of the input-output models and on their uses for policy analysis. A large number of such analyses can be undertaken using input-output models. These include analysis of pollution generation by source for any specified time period, study of pollution generation trends under a number of economic assumptions, comparison of alternative pollution abatement costs, determination of the environmental and economic effects of alternative raw material inputs, analysis of economic and environmental impacts resulting from alternate output and/or end-product specifications, and others."
"Static input-output analysis of economic systems via Leontief matrices and related concepts has been well known for many years. There have been Various attempts to extend this to dynamic systems. A dynamic model is proposed in this paper which takes advantage of the Leontief matrix formulation. This model makes possible the description of the dynamic transition from one state of production to another. It is also shown how labor affects this transition as well as how uncertainty enters in."
"Eight initiatives for revitalizing urban America within the current century are given. These scenarios are weighted by four ranking criteria and ranked. The eight scenarios are: growth centers, new towns-in-town, satellite developments, free-standing new communities, benign neglect, microrevitalization, elimination of cities, and the transcendental solution."
"The design of a system to provide for delivery of social services to clients and accountability to the state is presented. An introduction to actual systems problems in social services delivery is provided together with the human interaction processes necessary to bring successfully the systems approach to social service delivery. An analysis of case histories has been accomplished to determine common characteristics among actual cases which leads to a classification system for multiproblem families relative to family functioning. A detailed description of the system and the flow diagrams of information, decision, and activity (IDA) points is given. The system is in and working in Lynchburg, Va. and is to be installed and completed in Chesapeake, Va., by the end of 1974. Typical displays of the information system outputs as provided to case workers and supervisors are shown."
"For the past three years, the M.I.T. Community Dialog Project has facilitated approximately 200 group meetings, settings ranging from high schools and universities to political and industrial organizations, from senior citizens groups and rotary clubs to state and national assemblies of government officials, scientists and businessmen. Using electronic voting technology and specially designed meeting procedures, every participant is enabled to make an anonymous coded response to questions posed by the moderator or another participant, and to observe instantaneously a tally of how many people voted in what category. The purpose is to get a rapid appraisal of where there is consensus and where there is controversy, to allow participants to reveal their ignorance, to deal with controversial questions without intimidation, and generally to make the discussion more responsive to real interests and needs of the group. In special cases, quantitative procedures are used to rate alternatives against criteria and find group utilities, but mostly these procedures are regarded as an augmentation of normal free discussion and idea formulation, not a means for commitment to final decision. The paper evaluates the usefulness of these techniques as a function of the type of topic and questions used, the personality and experience of participants, the style of the moderator, and other factors. It poses fundamental questions regarding the democratic process especially in view of rapidly increasing capabilities for large scale community communication, such as are provided by two-way cable TV."
"An overview of modeling in the energy field and its role in the formulation of national energy policy is presented. The nature of the modeling task and the various steps that it encompasses are described. The methodological alternatives available to the energy system planner in the conceptualization, development, and use of models are presented. Alternative policy instruments in the various supply and demand sectors are examined and their use in policy analysis is discussed. Finally, recent experience in the modeling field is drawn upon to exemplify the interactive nature of model building and point out some areas of immediate challenge that hold promise for the future."
"The energy cost of goods and services is computed, and applications are discussed. The method utilizes the data base of input-output economics, but entails additional analysis. Applications range over consumption options for individuals, business, industry, and government; from the total energy cost of bus versus auto travel to the national import-export balance."
"The necessity for improved decision making concerning the siting and licensing of major power facilities has been accelerated in the past decade by the increased environmental consciousness of the public and by the energy crisis. These problems are exceedingly complex due to their multiple objective nature, the many interest groups, the long-range time horizons, and the inherent uncertainties of the potential impacts of any decision. Along with the relatively objective economic and engineering concerns, clearly the more subjective factors involving safety, environmental, and social issues are crucial to the problem. Hence, the professional judgments and knowledge of experts in these areas should be utilized in analyses of siting decisions. Likewise, the preferences of the general public, as consumers, the utility companies, as builders and operators of power plant facilities, and environmentalists and the government must be accounted for in analyzing power plant siting and licensing issues. We advocate an approach for formally articulating the experts' judgments and the decision makers' preferences, both of which are clearly subjective, and processing these along with the more objective considerations in a logical manner to acquire the implications for decision making. The appropriateness and application of decision analysis for power plant location decisions is discussed and illustrated in this paper. Emphasis is placed on the assessment of the decision maker's preferences and tradeoffs concerning multiple objectives."
"There appears to be increasing evidence that contemporary social and environmental problems and energy shortage are symptomatic of prebreakdown stresses inherent in the technical and socioeconomic organization of our system of production and consumption processes as it evolved under the \"explosive\" force of the industrial revolution. In an effort to understand these stresses and evaluate alternatives for relieving them, we have abstracted our life-support system as three interdependent substrates: The natural environment, the man-made production and consumption system, and the institutional system of sociocybernetic regulation. The disciplines of ecology, engineering, and economics have developed a high degree of competency in dealing with narrowly defined problem sets within the separate substrates. However, a careful overview of the entire system illuminates startling functional and structural inconsistencies between the subcomponents. Specific examples are provided in order to elucidate some of the more obvious intersubstrate inconsistencies. Classes of ecological tolerances combined with systems-theoretic and economic considerations requisite for the resolution of these inconsistencies are examined and illustrated."
"The subject of large-scale modeling has always been one of great controversy. Recently there appears to be both an increase in the call from the user community for such tools, and writing on business of difficulties associated with producing them. This article is an attempt to investigate the feasibility of producing such models. It is a summary of a forthcoming book on the same subject. It looks at them from the point of view of data, theory, implementation, validation, transfer, and use. The studies discussed are generally ones produced by EPA or NSF over the last two years. In the main: the outstanding problem area appears not to be technical but in the field of transfer and use."
"This descriptive paper explains what is included in the general subject of environmental design. Emphasis is on the structure of environmental design problems and the role of systems specialists in their resolution. A method for solving the \"site selection\" class of problems is presented and a case history using this method is given."
"In digital processing of continuous-time signals it is necessary to represent the signal by a sequence. In this letter a number of transforms are presented, generalizing the Poisson transform, which in addition to generating the sequences they also map continuous time-invariant convolution to discrete shift-invariant convolution."
"An initial value theorem for the Poisson transform is derived. Extension is made to the initial value of derivatives, examples are given, and applications described."
"The final and initial values of a continuous-time function f(t) can be obtained from the appropriate boundary values of the transfer operator G(s) = Lf(t)/Lu(t) where u(t) is the unit step function. This point of view helps in directly establishing the final and initial value theorems in Z domain."
"An algorithm based on moments of impulse response matrix is proposed which will yield an irreducible canonical form for linear time-invariant multivariable systems. The proposed method is also computationally simpler than the existing techniques."
"Exact formulas for the effect of series and Shunt feedback on noise figure are derived. The resulting noise figure is expressed by the feedback impedance, the two-port parameters, and the noise parameters of the device without feedback. The formulas are useful when considering the effect of biasing network and package elements on noise figure."
 "The frequency response of an amptitude-modulated GaAs luminescence diode has been studied for optical communication application. The modulated light intensity is found to fan off inversely proportional to the modulation frequency over the frequency range ωτ ≳ 1, where τ is the recombinative lifetime. We show that the falloff characteristic is a result of the complex diffusion process of the minority carrier in the presence of an ac perturbation across the junction. A simple relation which can be employed to determine the minority lifetime accurately to within a nanosecond is derived."

"Transforms using number theoretic concepts are developed as a method for fast and error-free calculation of finite digital convolution. The transforms are defined on finite fields and rings of integers with arithmetic carried out modulo an integer and it is shown that under certain conditions this gives the same results as conventional digital convolution. Because of these characteristics they are ideally suited to digital computation by taking into account quantization of amplitude as well as time in their definition. When the modulus is chosen as a Fermat number a transform results that requires only on the order of N log N additions and word shifts but no multiplications. In addition to being efficient, they have no roundoff error and do not require storage of basis functions. There is a restriction on sequence length imposed by word length and a problem with overflow but methods for overcoming these are presented. Results of an implementation on an IBM 370/155 are presented and compared with the fast Fourier transform showing a substantial improvement in efficiency and accuracy. Variations on the basic number theoretic transforms are also presented."
"This paper gives an exposition of linear prediction in the analysis of discrete signals. The signal is modeled as a linear combination of its past values and present and past values of a hypothetical input to a system whose output is the given signal. In the frequency domain, this is equivalent to modeling the signal spectrum by a pole-zero spectrum. The major part of the paper is devoted to all-pole models. The model parameters are obtained by a least squares analysis in the time domain. Two methods result, depending on whether the signal is assumed to be stationary or nonstationary. The same results are then derived in the frequency domain. The resulting spectral matching formulation allows for the modeling of selected portions of a spectrum, for arbitrary spectral shaping in the frequency domain, and for the modeling of continuous as well as discrete spectra. This also leads to a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the least squares error criterion. A spectral interpretation is given to the normalized minimum prediction error. Applications of the normalized error are given, including the determination of an \"optimal\" number of poles. The use of linear prediction in data compression is reviewed. For purposes of transmission, particular attention is given to the quantization and encoding of the reflection (or partial correlation) coefficients. Finally, a brief introduction to pole-zero modeling is given."
"A framework is presented for the analysis, representation, and evaluation of digital filter structures. Based on the notation of linear signal-flow graphs and their equivalent matrix representation, a set of general linear digital network properties are reviewed, including precedence relations computability, Tellegen's theorem, interreciprocity, and network transposition. These properties are then utilized in developing time and frequency domain analysis techniques and sensitivity analysis techniques. These techniques, in turn, are applied to the comparison of several basic digital filter structures."
"This paper discusses the various approaches to designing FIR digital filters using the theory of weighted Chebyshev approximation. The different design techniques are explained and compared on the basis of their capabilities and limitations. The relationships between filter parameters are briefly discussed for the case of low-pass filters. Extensions of the theory to the problems of magnitude and complex approximation are also included, as are some recent results on the design of two-dimensional FIR filters by transformation."
"The problems of designing and implementing LSI systems for the processing of 2-D digital data, such as images or geophone arrays, are reviewed and discussed. This discussion encompasses both FIR and IIR digital filters and with respect to the latter, the issues of stability testing and filter stabilization are also considered. Techniques are also presented whereby such filtering can be accomplished using either 1 or 2-D LSI systems."
"There is an increasing trend to use digital signal-processing techniques to solve real-time problems. This leads to a need for processors which can perform complicated signal-processing algorithms on large amounts of data at high speeds. Computer architectures for this purpose ate shown to arise from a consideration of several structural factors, including technology, the algorithms to be performed, data structures, and the programming language. When these factors are complementary, efficient yet economical designs result. The structural factors are described, and then several computer designs are discussed in light of this conceptual framework."
"A tutorial summary of the basic considerations necessary for designing custom digital filter hardware is presented. Emphasis is placed on fundamental principles and not on promotion of a specific design approach. The paper begins with a review of quantization (finite-accuracy arithmetic) effects. This is followed by a discussion of the elements of digital filters and how they are constructed, a review of the important technologies available, and a discussion of how the elements are put together to make a system. As examples of recent vintage hardware, the final section discusses three multipliers suitable for use in digital filters."
"Seismic prospecting for oil and gas has undergone a digital revolution during the past decade. Most stages of the exploration process have been affected: the acquisition of data, the reduction of this data in preparation for signal processing, the design of digital filters to detect primary echoes (reflections) from buried interfaces, and the development of technology to extract from these detected signals information on the geometry and physical properties of the subsurface. The seismic reflection is genenlly weak, and it must be strengthened by the use of signal summing (stacking) procedures. The determination of depths to a target horizon requires knowledge of the propagational velocities of seismic stress waves, and a wealth of technology has evolved for this purpose. More recently, it has been possible to relate signal amplitude to the physical properties of the medium traversed and, in particular, to make inferences about the oil and gas content of the buried rocks. Much of the exploration effort occurs in offshore areas, where reverberations in the water layer mask reflections from below. The method of predictive deconvolution has been most effective in its ability to attenuate these reverberations, making it possible to detect reflections from structures at depth. Seismic signal processing is neither pure science nor pure art, and offers a continuing challenge to the practitioners of both cultures."
"This paper presents several digital signal processing methods for representing speech. Included among the representations are simple waveform coding methods; time domain techniques; frequency domain representations; nonlinear or homomorphic methods; and finaIly linear predictive coding techniques. The advantages and disadvantages of each of these representations for various speech processing applications are discussed."
"This paper addresses the problem of deconvolving two signals when both are unknown. The authors call this problem blind deconvolution. The discussion develops two related solutions which can be applied through digital signal processing in certain practical cases. The case of reverberated and resonated sound forms the center of the development. The specific problem of restoring old acoustic recordings provides an experimental test. The important effects of noise and non-stationary signals lead to the detailed part of the presentation. In addition, the paper presents results for the case of images degraded by some common forms of blur."
"A review of the field of digital image processing is presented, with concentration upon image formation and recording processes, digital sampling and digital image display, and with in-depth coverage of image coding and image restoration. New results in image restoration are also presented, covering restoration by use of an eye-model constraint and nonlinear restoration by maximization of the posterior density function."
  "It is shown that even in a strongly dispersive medium, the packet velocity and the energy velocity are identical. For the slightly absorptive medium, expressions are given for the pulse velocity and the pulse damping. Different velocity definitions are discussed with relation to experiments."
"In the past, aircraft radar observations measured diffuse backscatter from terrain. Recent Skylab radar returns from land areas indicate a specular reflection. It is shown that, if both diffuse and specular reflections are present, the specular component becomes more dominant as the platform height increases."
"A simple test for the separability of multivariable (MV) polynomials which occur in the study of MV networks and multi-dimensional digital filters, etc., is presented. The separability condition is given in terms of the coefficients of the MV polynomials and expressing the given polynomial, if separable, as a product of single-variable polynomials is a direct consequence of the test for separability."
"A least-mean-square (LMS) adaptive algorithm for complex signals is derived. The original Widrow-Hoff LMS algorithm is Wj+l= Wj+ 2µεjXj. The complex form is shown to be Wj+1= Wj+ 2µεjX-j, where the boldfaced terms represent complex (phasor) signals and the bar above Xjdesignates complex conjugate."
"A simple procedure for the inversion of a general continued fraction is presented."
"A new form of mod-2 adder has been implemented and is shown to be capable of ultra-high-speed operation. Its application to the generation of 500-Mb/s m sequences is described, in which the addition is performed using the transition in low-weed sequences, and thereby achieving a doubling of the bit rate."
"Given the proper pole-zero configuration, the 90° phase-difference network can be synthesized in the forum of an RC lattice by means of simple algebraic operations. An example of a network actually built is given."
 "Some n-p-n transistors in integrated circuits show switching performance above a collector current. This is explained in this letter as p-n-p-n switching performance induced by minority carrier injection from a Schottky-barrier contact which is formed accidentally at a part of the periphery of collector metallization contact through the mask alignment process."
"Degradation of the microwave efficiency due to the undepleted high-resistivity epitaxial region was experimentally found to be remarkably, small on GaAs X-band conventional-type IMPATT diodes. The result seems to be consistent with large low-field drift mobility for electrons in GaAs. Present study confirms the superiority of n-GaAs over other materials for IMPATT diode use."
"Variations in conductance of thin films of InSb with thickness of vacuum-deposited overlay of SiO thin film indicate surface depletion or enhancement in semiconductors by substrate temperatures. These films are applied in the construction of monolithic elastic surface-wave amplifiers."
"Multiple-wavelength light from an ion laser was transmitted through a 85-µm optical fiber to provide illumination for viewing and color photography. Also adequate black-and-white TV display and photography were obtained using red light from an He-Ne laser transmitted through the same optical fiber."
"It is shown that 1) a binary autoregressive sequence generated by yn= xn⊕ yn-N, where N = 2Kand K = 0, 1,..., is wide-sense Markov and 2) under the condition Pr [xn= 1] = p < 0.5, the error associated with a one-step prediction of a first-order Markov sequence yn= Xn⊕ yn-1grows with the order N of the predictor. The error attains its minimum value when N = 1."
"A description of a way of finding the maximum compatibles (maximal complete subgraphs of an undirected graph) is presented. Only a few operations are needed and at each step the graph under consideration is reduced."
"This letter discusses an organization of an approach to form the inner product of a pair of data vectors. The criterion is the minimization of the number of adders, the independent variable is the number of bits to be formed in the product. The cost ratio of addition-to-storage provided the motivation for this investigation.

"Miniaturization has steadily increased the economic usefulness of digital electronics through the past two decades. A variety of physical arguments are brought to bear on the question of how far miniaturization can be extended. The implications of the laws of quantum mechanics and thermodynamics for information storage are examined. The need for power dissipation in electrical information processing is demonstrated and the limits set on miniaturization by the problems of removing the heat thereby produced are estimated. limits with origins in properties of the materials used to make electronic devices are reviewed. The potential performance of various technologies based on nonsemiconductor phenomena is estimated and compared with the limits found for planar silicon technology. Attempts are made to guess at all of the many unknown parameters that enter into broadly applicable quantitative expressions of the properties of logic circuitry so that actual values of the limits can be estimated."
"A Fourier transform technique is used to evaluate the forces on planar polygonal dc current coils moving parallel with a conducting sheet as applied to the magnetic levitation of high-speed ground vehicles. In addition to the lift and drag forces usually discussed, a side force may exist if the current coils are asymmetric with respect to the direction of vehicle motion. For some geometrically symmetric coils, the side force may be viewed as a transverse drag which exponentially damps small lateral motion. For some other coils, instability may occur due to a perturbation in the lateral direction. With proper design, a significantly large side force (comparable to drag) may be generated and controlled by mechanical or electrical means. This side force can be used for lateral control purposes."
"Ferrimagnetic materials for microwave applications are reviewed with emphasis on the more recent advances. Specific areas of discussion include temperature sensitivity of the magnetization, microwave loss phenomena and the concept of effective linewidth, and the hysteresis loop in terms of the factors which influence its coercive force, remanence ratio, and stress sensitivity. The relations between specific chemical substitutions and the attendant magnetic properties are then summarized for the various spinel and garnet ferrite families of interest to the microwave device engineer. Finally, the ceramic preparation of ferrite materials is outlined with special focus on some of the newer techniques."
"The results obtained in recent years on laser irradiance propagation in random weakly inhomogeneous media with large scale index of refraction fluctuations are reviewed. Of particular concern are the problems of the cozrelation theory of fluctuations of irradiance propagating over large distances, where the effects of multiple scattering are greatly pronounced. Much attention is paid to the results on laser beams spread and phase fluctuations. Consideration is given to problem of the study of spatial spikes of irradiance that had passed through a turbulent media; which is comparatively new but important for practical applications. Systematic comparison of the theory with experiment is given where appropriate. The methods of analyses reviewed in this paper are applicable to a class of stochastic and dynamic partial differential equations and thus may be of interest in other areas of engineering reseach."
"The radar-range equation, if not carefully applied, will indicate that power returned from corner-cube reflectors various as the inverse fourth power of the range. Careful attention to the meaning of each team in the equation leads to an inverse second-power relationship. This result is confirmed by analysis according to geometric optics."

"In the approximately fifteen years since the beginnings of time sharing, or interactive computing, this mode of operation has greatly influenced the development of computing systems. To summarize this development, a brief review of the projections of a decade ago is made, and then the developments of the intervening years are considered under the headings of hardware, process structure, operating systems, and system models. Finally, some predictions of future developments are made, based on observations of the still rapidly evolving technology and the resultant trend toward the special-purpose application of digital systems."
"Recognition of computer science as a research and educational field in its own right began only a decade ago. The computer science mainstream has been focused upon the understanding and creation of discourse between humans and, more specifically, between humans and their informational resources, both human and machine. This is in contrast with the common and predominate institutional view that the computer is an arithmetic engine. The present and potential informational resources valuable to a human require little concern for arithmetic. The human value of informational resources results through aiding the human's ability to externalize models of issues, things, or events, i.e., the key to understanding and then communicating, Interactive computing issues will continue to be the driving force of computer science resulting in eventual common awareness that the computer is a populist communications medium."
"An attempt is made to integrate a wide range of material into a conceptual structure for the design of man-computer interfaces for on-line interactive systems. Typical roles for the human in man-computer systems are considered. Suggestions for the design of systems are developed in discussions of displays and input devices, visual information processing, and mathematical models of human behavior. Possible developments and avenues of research in man-computer systems are suggested."
"The evolution of general-purpose computing-systems architecture has been strongly influenced by the emergence of new technologies, the demand for new system applications, and the identification of significant architectural concepts. It is argued that today's architecture is primarily the product of this evolutionary process rather than the result of a deliberate design process. Current architectural structures age examined in terms of their ability to fully exploit forthcoming hardware technologies, particularly in the memory and data management areas, and also their potential for resolving the serious problems which currently exist in the area of software development."
"A number of significant architectural concepts which have evolved in recent years are reviewed. These concepts are: the notion of process and the facilities for process management, such as dispatching and synchronization; the use of segmentation in organizing address spaces, and the resulting sharing and protection capabilities; the control of access to data and procedures via multiple privilege levels; the use of automatic stack management for procedure calling; and the structure of logical and physical I/O channels and I/O operations queueing. The rationale for including these concepts in modem central processor architectures, such as in the Honeywell Series 60, is also presented."
"The primary concerns of I/O subsystem architecture include the coordination of central processor and I/O subsystem activities, the mapping of external I/O processing requirements into the basic functionality of the I/O subsystem, and the management of concurrent processing activities within the I/O subsystem itself. Architectural developments such as data and command chaining, channel program interfaces, automatic key searching, rotational portion sensing, and block multiplexing are evaluated in terms of these underlying concerns. A number of new arguments are presented to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of current designs, and several projections are made concerning the future evolution of this area."
"A survey of reasons fog and methods of dividing large computer programs into parts is presented. The paper concentrates on over-all or external program structures (e.g., methods of sharing data among procedures) rather than on internal program structures, such as arrays, pointers, loops, and conditional statements. The paper classifies reasons for dividing programs as arising from 1) physical constraints such as limited memory space, and 2) human constraints such as division of programming responsibility. The principal tool fog organizing programs to meet human constraints is functional decomposition, i.e., dividing a program and its specifications according to (hopefully simple) functions of the program parts. Unfortunately, the various constraints which impose divisions upon a large program do not necessarily suggest the same program organisation. The central portion of the paper deals with mechanism for program compsition. These mechanisms are classified as 1) routines which are called by sequential process (a routine is any procedure-like software mechanism), 2) mechanisms for data sharing among routines (such as Fortran's common data blocks and Algol's scope rules), and 3) mechanisms for handling asynchronous interactions (such as requesting the scheduling of input/output operations). The paper also discusses techniques for folding programs to meet memory constraints (by overlaying, paging, and segmenting) and methods of linking separately compiled procedures."
"Minicomputers pgoggammed in a high-level interactive language form a very attractive basis fog the development of systems involving close man-computer collaboration. This paper is based on a wide range of experience of interactive minicomputer systems in commercial, medical, industrial, and scientific applications. It is first argued that the development of systems fog effective man-computer collaboration requires not only interactive system use but also interactive system depelopment. The designer needs to be able to tailor the system to user requirements at least partially as an experimental dialogue at a terminal with a user. There follows a critique of certain features of central computer utilities that limit their effectiveness in interactive apllications, leading to a proposal fog the use of minicomputer-based systems programmed, and used, interactively. We then give a number of case histories of our own experience in developing and using such systems in commercial, medical, and scientific appllications. From this experience, we have extracted a number of rules for programming interaction between the user and computer system which are outed. Finally, the main features of the software technology underlying these systems are briefly described."
"The Michigan Terminal System (MTS) is a general-purpose operating system fog the IBM 360 and 370 computers.

Brief descriptions of performance measurement and accounting are also included."
"The file system for the Michigan terminal system (MTS) is described. MTS is a general-purpose multiprogramming multiprocessing paged time-sharing system for the IBM 360/67 and 370/168 developed at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. First, an overview of some of the external facilities provided to the users of files is presented; then some of the internal design philosophy and corresponding implementation strategy for the file system are discussed. Particular emphasis is placed on how the sharing of files is accomplished, both from the user's point of view and the system's point of view. A retrospective judgment of some of the strengths and weaknesses of the MTS file system is given. Finally, an appendix details the allowable concurrent usage of files and the algorithm used for file deadlock detection in MTS."
"A queueing network is used to show that the page-fault-rate functions of active programs axe the critical factors in system processing efficiency. Properties of page-fault functions are set forth in tenns of a locality model of program behavior. Memory management policies are grouped into two fixed-partition and three variable-partition classes acording to their methods of allocating memory and controlling the multiprogramming load. It is concluded that the so-called working set policies can be expected to yield the lowest paging rates and highest processing efficiency of all the classes."
"A scheduling algorithm which is a modification of the standard TENEX scheduler is described. This algorithm differs from those commonly used in time-sharing systems in that it treats the case of multiple critical resources. The Utah scheduler considers CPU usage and real core occupancy, but the same techniques can be applied to cases of more than two critical resources. Similar scheduling tehniques can be applied to interactive batch-processing systems and to resource sharing systems."
"An overview is presented of queueing theoretic modeling and analysis of interactive computing systems. While the emphasis is on recent advances, an introduction is given which briefly trices the historical development of this area to put current research in perspective.

"A closed queueing network model with state dependent routing probabilities is developed for the study of interactive computing systems which use swapping as a memory managmnent strategy. An algorithm to obtain an approximate solution of the mathematical model is proposed. Based on meamuements of a dual-processor PDP-10 system, the model is found to be better in predicting the system performance than the classical model without state dependent routing probabilities."
"The complex task of managing a virtual memory multiprogramming system is considered as one which can be achieved by allowing the operating system to make use of measurement data gathered on-line in the scheduling decisions it has to make. System performance optimization is achieved by continuous monitoring of critical system parameters and workload characteristics and by use of this information in a real-time adaptive feedback control policy. As a specific application of this approach, the maximization of system throughput by the regulation of the degree of multiprogramming in a virtual memory system is examined. The specific form of this performance measure as a function of the number of active processes sharing main memory is used in the design of an adaptive and statistical maximum-seeking algorithm designed to respond to abrupt changes in program locality. The data gathering and smoothing procedures and the optimization policy are then implemented in a simulator of a virtual memory time-sharing system and evaluated in simulation runs with a random and time-varying workload. These experiments are used to tune the various parameters of the algorithm and to demonstrate its ability to maintain the system at an optimal level of performance. Statistical confidence intervals for these simulation runs are given in order to provide a measure of significance to the experiments."
"This paper presents a case study of the development of a realistic, but analytically soluble, model of a very complex Computer system. This modeling project required the development and application of new dements of technology to support the modeling process. These included the use of a hierarchic structuring procedure to provide a fonnal control structure for the modeling process, and the use of perturbation analysis to correct known deficiencies in the faithfulness of the model representation of the actual system. Particular attention was paid to the effects of passive resources, and to contention and interference effects caused by competition for shared resources. The system actually modeled is the Advanced Logistics System of the United States Air Force Logistics Command. The computer configuration of this system includes multiple CDC Cyber 70 mainframes, a large quantity of extended core storage, and approximately 100 disk drives. The analytic model was validated against a simulation which uses the logical queue structure of the software system as its basis. Excellent agreement was obtained. The entire modeling process was completed and documented in two months by a team of six analysts."

"The omnipresent noise in electronic circuits and devices is generally considered undesirable. This paper describes some of the applications to which it has been put. Short descriptions of a wide variety of applications are given together with references for further details. The applications fall in four categories: applications in which noise is used as a broad-band random signal; measurements in which the random noise is used as a test signal; measurements in which noise is used as a probe into microscopic phenomena; and the applications where noise is a conceptual or theoretical tool. Many examples of applications in each of these categories are given. Some of the applications included are only of historical interest now, and a few are, as yet, only proposals."
"A general theory of electrodynamics of moving and deformable media is developed on the basis of the Chu formulation of the Maxwell equations and the general principles of continuum mechanics. From the two-dipole model for polarization and magnetization and the concept of the Lorentz force on electric and magnetic dipoles, the body force, the body couple, and the energy supply of electromagnetic origin are determined explicitly in terms of the dectromagnetic variables. These kinetic quantities appear in the balance equations for the mechanics of deformable bodies, which are coupled to the Maxwell equations. Boundary conditions and constitutive equations which satisfy the principle of objectivity are obtained for polarizable and magnetizable elastic solids and viscous fluids."
"When the ionized upper atmosphere of the earth is illuminated by high-power HF radio waves at appropriate frequencies, the temperature of electrons in the ionosphere can be raised substantially. In addition, radio waves with sufficient energy cause parametric instabilities that generate a spectrum of intense plasma waves. Observations of these phenomena have produced new understanding of plasma processes. One consequence of heating and plasma wave generation is that irregularities are formed in the electron distribution which are aligned with the earth's magnetic field. Because of this, a scatterer of large radar cross section is produced, which scatters HF through UHF communication signals over long distance paths, that would not otherwise be normally possible by ionospheric means. This paper summarizes results of radio, radar, communication, and photometric experiments that explored the characteristics of the volume of ionosphere which has been intentionally modified, temporarily, above facilities near Boulder (Platteville), Colo., and at Arecibo, Puerto Rico."

In addition, the historical background and motivation is presented for the inners approach. The importance of the inners notion to education, computation, and research in system theory is surveyed and evaluated. Future research problems using this concept are enumerated. Finally, this survey is documented by many past and recent references."

"An overview of the demand for various types of memory used with computer systems is presented. The types of memory and the major memory applications are discussed and analyzed for trends which will affect the amount and type of memory required for future computer systems. General business and scientific computers are by far the largest users of memory. This trend will continue with the advent of centralization of files, teleprocessing, and the use of virtual memory techniques to reduce the cost of memory and provide for machine-controlled memory management. The amount of on-line or direct-access memory available to users will continue to increase permitting extremely large files, program libraries, and information libraries which will be accessed by remote terminals and CPU's. Additional large demands for memory are developing in minicomputer-and microcomputer-based systems for industrial, business, and scientific uses as well as in intelligent terminal and data entry devices. These smaller processors, while contributing to the trend toward distributed processing, will also serve as the controllers for distributed file storage. The recent developments in the field of \"mini\" storage devices will be extended to provide even lower cost storage for use with small systems."
"The Octopus computer network at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, University of California, Livermore, ties together one of the largest concentrations of computing capability in the world, serving about 1500 users. The network's information storage capacity is large in every range of access speed. There are computers with main memories of 30 Mbits and secondary storage of 10 Gbits, a shared tertiary store of 1 Tbit, and 30-40 thousand reels of magnetic tape. This storage supports correspondingly large numerical simulations and other application programs that require the continuous operation of four major computers. Efficient storage use necessitates proper design of algorithms and buffer structures on the part of both the users and the system implementors. The main problems that arise include maintenance of high data transfer rates, reliability in the presence of intermittent hardware failure, achieving balance between media with differing access speeds, flexibility of the indexing structure, and equitable allocation among users. The discussion covers these issues in some detail and includes an historical perspective and estimates of future trends."
"The conventional general-purpose data management system tends to make inefficient use of storage space. By reducing the physical size of the data, substantial savings are available in the area of storage cost. Reduction ratios of 4:1 and more are realizable. This also reduces the amount of I/O time required to physically transfer data between secondary and primary memories. Since I/O time tends to be the pacing factor when processing large data bases, this could produce a 4:1 or greater reduction in response time. Data compression experience with four large data bases is described. In some applications, only a small fraction of the data transferred in an individual I/O operation is relevant to the query being processed. If usage patterns are measured and data records and fields are rearranged so that those which are commonly referenced together are also physically stored together, then additional savings are available. Once the data base has been partitioned into clusters of commonly accessed data, further efficiencies can be obtained by choosing data structures, compression strategies, and storage devices that are optimal for the recent usage pattern observed on that cluster."
"An analysis is made of the cost/performance effectiveness of virtual memory systems employing paging disks or drums and those employing electronic backing stores such as charge coupled devices (CCD), MOS shift registers, or bubbles. The analysis is based on a multiprogrammed job stream and a simplified queuing model employing page-fault rates suitable for a variety of multiprogrammed environments. Smaller memory systems and single job programming are also considered. It is shown that memory access plus page transfer time is a critical parameter, in addition to cost. Curves are generated for a variety of job environments in which the cost/performance effectiveness of two-level memory hierarchies employing electronic backing stores is compared to that of systems employing paging drums. Competitive prices per bit are determined for a number of system environments. The analysis clearly demonstrates that in many problem environments, the electronic backing store will replace the traditional paging drum or disk if the cost per bit is significanfly less than the main memory cost per bit as projected. Disk and tape memories can be expected to continue as the dominant memories for bulk storage in the near future because of their already small and diminishing costs per bit."
"An analysis of the performance enhancement achieved and the incremental costs accrued in buffering (using a cache memory) memory systems is made. Buffering is found to be cost-effective even for minicomputer memories. The study indicates that the flagged registered swap algorithm is superior to three other common algorithms used. It is shown that when jobs are switched, a substantial number of memory requests are required before the buffer fills and gives a high hit ratio. It is also shown that individuaIly buffered main-memory modules can be interleaved to achieve very high system performance."
"Evolution of present integrated-circuit technology over the remainder of the decade should result in semiconductor memories which are competitive with moving-surface memories and other alternatives in many digital storage applications requiring 107-1010bits capacity. This paper considers MOS, MNOS, CCD, and bipolar component approaches to this objective. Cost, reliability, and power consumption, as affected by technological choices, receive attention. Alternative device technologies and circuit designs are examined. The one-transistor MOS RAM is seen to have potential for considerable growth. Packaging and interconnection methods for low cost and high reliability are considered; evolution of existing techniques is expected. Reliability and maintainability characteristics are seen to be controlled by device technology, component organization, and packaging characteristics. Testing, screening, and error-correction techniques are considered. Projections of component characteristics are extended to outline hypothetical designs for 4-million-bit and 256-million-bit storage systems which might be built by 1980. Features include 64K-bit MOS RAM components on die of area under 100 mm2, system selling price of 40 m¢/bit, power consumption well below 1 µW/bit, system MTBF greater than 105h, and physical density on the order of 16000 bits/ cm3. The basis for projected parameters is explained. The advantages and drawbacks of these hypothetical systems relative to moving-surface magnetic storage systems are outlined."

The evolution of the initial concepts is illustrated by examining the features incorporated in these successive models. Projections describing possible future systems are also made."
"The IBM 3850 is a hierarchical storage system that provides capacities of up to 472 billion bytes and offers disk-access capabilities by use of a virtual direct-access storage concept. The architecture of the system is described in terms of control and data flow within the mass storage system (MSS). An example of tape/disk I/O work load on a current system is analyzed to indicate the data-transfer demand that the major interfaces in the MSS storage hierarchy would face as part of determining an appropriate configuration. The systems control and techniques of space management are also outlined."
"The IBM 3850 mass storage system is a new concept in large data base storage. This paper explores the principal design objectives and the options chosen in designing the hardware and the data flow for the system. The 3850 is an approach that provides up to 472 × 109bytes of storage, gives reasonable on-line storage cost comparable to manually loaded flexible media products such as half-inch tape drives, provides internally controlled data staging at the request of the host processor, and provides a parallel-path data flow. The parallel-path data flow in turn provides multiple staging and destaging-plus increased availability of data--by using full multiple data paths for all data."
"Magnetic bubbles-an emerging storage technique-promise to bridge the capacity-data retrieval time gap left vacant by magnetic core and semiconductor devices on one side and the electromechanical magnetic tape and disk on the other. Improvements in bubble materials, circuit processing, and device design have advanced bubble technology to where it is a solid candidate for applications requiring 106-108bits and retrieval times less than 0.005 s. Bubble chips as large as 65 kbits are currently under development. In this paper, the reader is first introduced to the topics of bubble statics and bubble dynamics, including a discussion of hard bubbles. Next, the operation of bubble devices such as propagation, generation, detection, and replication is described, as well as chip organizations using these functions. Temperature plays an important role and its effect on domain generation and data longevity is described. Fabrication techniques for bubble chips used in prototype mass memory modules and an experimental memory for a repertory telephone are given as are the overall systems' performance. Details of a 32-pin dual in-line bubble package are described. Finally, some predictions into the future are attempted for this technology. This discussion includes self-structuring propagation of bubbles and the bubble lattice file memory concept."
"Two areas of major emphasis in the development of magnetic bubble memories are discussed: the effort to increase the bit-packing density and the effort to increase the operating speed of these memories. It is pointed out that increasing the density by scaling down an existing chip design involves consideration of not only lithographic and fabrication problems, but also magnetic materials problems. High density chips may be obtained with at least three different chip configurations: 1) the familiar Permalloy-bar file (PBF) employing T-bar figures, but fabricated with electron-beam lithography and single-level masking; 2) the contiguous-disk file (CDF) which utilizes relatively coarse Permalloy patterns and hence eases lithography requirements; and 3) the bubble-lattice file (BLF) which employs closely packed bubbles with a novel wall-structure data-coding scheme. The relative advantages of these three schemes are compared: the PBF has been developed the farthest and is the only configuration employing single-level masking; the highest density is offered by the CDF if lithography is not the limiting factor, and by the BLF if the achievement of small-diameter bubbles is the limiting factor. Two factors which govern the operating speed of a bubble memory are discussed: the velocity of propagation of a bubble and the organization of the memory so as to achieve the shortest possible access and latency times. Significant progress is being made in the development of bubble materials which support high bubble velocities; this progress is based on understanding of complex changes in wall structure which occur during bubble motion. The advantages of the major/minor loop and coincident-selection organizational schemes in reducing access times and in sharing interconnections and electronics are reviewed. The capabilities of the magnetic bubble memory technology are briefly compared with those of the semiconductor and magnetic disk technologies."
"Optical techniques for data storage have advanced rapidly during the last decade. Optical data storage presents many unique advantages, notably the high storage density and low access time, not attainable by conventional recording techniques. The special features of optical recording, the proposed materials and techniques, the components for optical storage as well as some representative optical bit-by-bit and holographic recording systems are reviewed. It is noted that in spite of the lack of widespread commercial success of the optical recording at the present, some unique devices have been successfully demonstrated. The knowledge accumulated in the development of optical data storage should be useful for many recent Applications such as video recording. It is expected that when the conventional magnetic memory technology reaches its limit, optical storage technology should be a competitive contender for the next generation data storage."
"BEAMOS-beam addressed metal-oxide-semiconductor is a new technology for fast auxiliary memories which is expected to find important applications in military and commercial data systems. The concept is based on electron beam accessing, using a matrix lens, of a simple MOS memory chip. It has performance features which include large bit capacity per module (> 30 × 106bits), short access time ( 10 Mbit/s), and low cost. The BEAMOS module is all electronic, rugged, and relatively insensitive to variations in temperature, making it especially attractive for military computer applications. The operating principles of the BEAMOS memory and its present state of development are described."

"The applications of lasers to medicine and biology have grown very rapidly over the last decade and now include a wide variety of activities. These range from eye surgery through holographic microscopy and pattern recognition to the sealing of dental enamel. This paper reviews some of the fundamentals which underlie these applications and briefly reviews a few of the more significant applications themselves. In particular, the interactions between lasers and the biological material are discussed in an attempt to develop a physical foundation for the applications of lasers to surgery. This is followed by a discussion of the threshold for laser damage to eyes and the application to the repair of detached retinas and diabetic retinopathy. Applications of lasers to more general surgery, such as cutting of the liver, and to the special problem of microsurgery in embryology, are treated briefly. A variety of other papers and books have treated some aspects of this subject [1]-[5]; however, this paper presents a concise treatment of major applications with more than usual emphasis on the background physics. The background on holographic microscopy and pattern recognition is not treated here, but is partially covered in [6]-[9]."
"This tutorial paper explores the mechanics of protecting computer-stored information from unauthorized use or modification. It concentrates on those architectural structures-whether hardware or software-that are necessary to support information protection. The paper develops in three main sections. Section I describes desired functions, design principles, and examples of elementary protection and authentication mechanisms. Any reader familiar with computers should find the first section to be reasonably accessible. Section II requires some familiarity with descriptor-based computer architecture. It examines in depth the principles of modern protection architectures and the relation between capability systems and access control list systems, and ends with a brief analysts of protected subsystems and protected objects. The reader who is dismayed by either the prerequisites or the level of detail in the second section may wish to skip to Section III, which reviews the state of the art and current research projects and provides suggestions for further reading."
"The most fundamental obstacle encountered in design of satellite communication systems at frequencies above 10 GHz is attenuation by rain. The microwave power radiated toward an earth station, being limited by factors such as available primary power and size of antenna on the satellite, is insufficient, with present technology, to overcome the large attenuation produced by intense rain cells on the earth-space path. The resultant loss of signal makes for unreliable transmission. In what follows, methods of measurement of this attenuation at various frequencies and a technique called path diversity that substantially improves the reliability are presented. Other degradations produced by rain, such as depolarization, interference, increase in earth-station noise, and deterioration of earth-station antenna performance, are also discussed."
"People have thought about their ears (and those of certain animals) for a long time. Intelligent speculation, supplemented by experiment (and vice versa), has brought us a long way toward understanding how the ear works-from subtle monaural phase effects (verboten by Ohm's law of acoustics) to expansive binaural stereophony (hailed by almost everyone). Much of this new gained knowledge, some of it acquired only very recently, has found its formal expression-as it has in other fields-in models: mathematical models or physical models (or both) of how the ear \"does it\" ... or might do it if it had been designed by fanciful model builders instead of by pragmatic evolution. In this paper, after a brief introduction into the human ear, a selection of models of both kinds is presented-not with claims of exhaustiveness, but with the intent to give a flavor of what is going on in a very active field on a fascinating, and ultimately still mysterious, subject: man's sense of hearing."
"A Gaussian method for fast evaluation of approximations to Fourier integral transforms is presented. This method is faster than the FFT for transforms of functions that require considerable computer time to compute. It is especially useful when transforms of high accuracy are needed."

"The feasibility of full-band low-noise instantaneous amplification in Ka band has been demonstrated using a staggered-gain amplifier technique. A simplified analysis of the overall gain variations in this two-stage amplifier is used to calculate the minimum isolation levels needed to meet a maximum allowable ripple. Using this technique, 10 ± 2.2-dB gain has been obtained from 26.6-39.4 GHz."
"Anechoic chamber foams are easily ignited by passage of current through them. Two distinct ignition processes can be observed. The first is a contact fire that results when two sharp points which are at a potential difference of more than 100 V touch the conducting foam. The second is an I2R heating of the interior of the foam which begins with smoldering, then a glowing chunk of foam inside the material which grows and usually ignites. An unexpected by-product of burning carbon-impregnated foam is the voluminous release of dense toxic smoke (Tatem and Williams [1])."
  "In general, the reviewer feels the book gives a workmanlike introduction to the fundamental concepts of optical information processing, touching upon most of the usual topics of scalar diffraction theory, Fourier tramformation in optics, coherence, modulation, spatial filtering, and applications of holography. The subject matter is treated from the current vantage point of communications and network theory and bene5ts from the succh&ma associated with this approach. Overal, the book should prove useful to senior undergraduate and fust year graduate students. The references are sufficiently extensive to enable the reader to pursue any of the topics covered in greater detail."

"Clinical evaluation of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings is based on complex subjective processes of data reduction and feature extraction. The high dimensionality of the EEG signal, its variability, and the lack of standard population values have retarded development of automated systems. An interactive, real-time analysis system (ADIEEG) has been implemented to develop features to simplify visual interpretation and facilitate automated classification. It uses a 40 000 word PDP15-PDP11 dual processor computer. Resident code occupies approximately 11 000 locations, while a maximum of 12 000 locations are used for buffers. The system performs 1) continuous spectral analysis using the fast Fourier transform to produce estimates of power and coherence, 2) parallel time domain analysis to detect sharp transients significant to diagnosis, 3) several forms of graphics, 4) simple algorithms to reject noncortical and instrumental artifact, 5) interactive parameter alteration and on-line feedback to adjust decision thresholds when necessary, and 6) extraction of diagnostically helpful features using heuristics based on clinical EEG. The ADIEEG system resides in the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center, and Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute."
"A computer-based system has been developed which reads blood pressure and heart rate of test animals used in cardiovascular research. The system employs an FM tape recorder and controller for data acquisition, contains positive identification of readings, and relies on an efficient algorithm for determining heart rate and blood pressure from recorded signals. The system has resulted in more accurate readings and has yielded considerable labor savings."
"The purpose of this research was to design and use a minicomputer-based data acquistion system in a clinical dental environment to digitize and analyze electromyogrohic (EMG) and jaw motion data. The quantitation of EMG in clinical problems requires a significant number of patients, short analysis times, and efficient acquisition and analysis of data. A present extension of this system is to utilize interactive computer graphics for presentation of these data for evaluation by clinical personnel. To facilitate EMG evaluation for clinical diagnostic purposes, a real-time capability was designed to accommodate high-speed simultaneous data collection from a multiplicity of signal sources, viz., 5 EMG channels, biting force, and jaw position. Once digitization and storage begin, data reduction and analysis programs are provided for immediate presentation of results. Application of the system to examine jaw motion has resulted in clinically useful diagnostic information. These results suggest that fuller utilization of the potential of the computer system will provide deeper clinical and physiological insight and, therefore, better dental treatment for a large fraction of the population."
"The description of an interactive interpretive on-line computer-television system for studying the behavior of organisms is presented. The movements of organisms in a wet-slide preparation is recorded on video tape with the aid of a microscope and rendered to a computer in outline form by a video-to-digital processor. Parameters relating to the behavior of the organisms, such as velocity and rate of change of direction, are extracted with an interactive graphics system. The objective of the system is to provide the human operator a set of both high-level and primitive keyboard operations which, in conjunction with the graphics terminal, provide the tools for the successful acquisition, analysis, and display of these behavioral data."
"Automation of X-ray laboratory instruments has been achieved by combining commercially available automation hardware, X-ray units of various manufacturers, and a PDP-11 minicomputer. The automation provides simultaneous on-line control of up to ten separate X-ray instruments through user programs written in Lab-Basic which is the 1-8 User Basic software enlarged by the incorporation of three of additional capabilities, viz., routines to control automation hardware, commands making the programming easier, and mass-storage facility. The interactive nature of the hardware and of the software was dictated by the diverse types of analyses required in a general-purpose X-ray laboratory. The automation system provides the versatility needed for the various X-ray procedures by allowing the user to plan, debug, and execute the measurement, data reduction, and data presentation. Analytical procedures automated so far include the measurement of residual stress by X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis of catalysts by X-ray fluorescence, and quantitative phase analysis of ceramic catalyst support material by X-ray diffraction. Extension to other methods is contemplated."
"A minicomputer-based laboratory test system at Sandia Laboratories, which acts interactively to control experiments and to apply graphic display techniques to the acquired data, is described. A short description of the hardware is included to emphasize its flexibility and general application in the nondestructive evaluation laboratory. The greater part of the paper covers examples of acquisition and data analysis using the interactive features of the system."
"The first phase of a feasibility study of automatic assembly and inspection of incandescent light bulb filaments in the industry is described. The problem is limited to the visual aspect of the system. Picture-processing and pattern-recognition techniques are employed 1) to preprocess the signal provided by a television camera, 2) to transform and extract the features of the object, 3) to classify the lead wires and support wires, and 4) to specify the coordinates of the locations of the tips of the wires. On the assumption that the locations of the tips in the three-dimensional space can be determined through the analysis and processing of two or more two-dimensional visual picture patterns at different angles, the first phase of this feasibility study is confined to processing two-dimensional picture patterns. A complete set of algorithms has been developed, implemented, and tested in the Signal Processing Laboratory, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio. Repeatability and consistency of the system are investigated by varying some key parameters, such as lighting, orientation of the object, and setting of the camera. The experimental results show no error in classification and negligible error in specification of the coordinates of the tips."
"Recent interest in characterizing fatigue mechanisms and damage propagation in the field of materials science has led to more closely controlled and sophisticated tests which have resulted in greater amounts of data to be recorded and processed. The application of real-time data acquisition and reduction to deal with these data in conjunction with an ongoing research project dealing with the effect of frequency on the fatigue of composite materials is discussed. Utilizing a Tektronix WP 1100, which consists of a digital processing oscilloscope and a programable calculator connected via an intelligent interface, load, strain, and acoustic emission signals are monitored continuously. The method of operation of this system and the ensuing software is detailed. This type of system is compared with other systems, and its effect on the research project is described."
"This paper presents the design, construction, and evaluation of an all-digital programmable tensile test system, superior in several ways to other systems presently available for testing yarns. However, the basic system concepts can be applied to tensile test systems for other materials. The system is capable of performing three standard yarn tests: constant rate of extension, constant rate of loading, and fatigue. Extension rates range from 1 mm/s to 420 mm/s. Loading rates of up to 700 g/s and above are possible. Fatigue testing allows sinusoidal loading of yarn at frequencies from 0.88 to 5.2 Hz. A minicomputer is used for direct digital control, data acquisition, and on-line analysis. A digital tension mechanism incorporating a variable-reluctance step motor was designed and constructed. A \"fractional stepping\" scheme is presented where the computer software is used to improve the displacement resolution for slow-speed breaks. A unique indirect digital force transducer was designed for the system employing transistor-transistor logic integrated circuits. The interrogation rate is 7 kHz, the load range is 0-700 g, and resolution for the present design is 4 g. Final testing of the digital system involves the comparison of test results with those from a proved programmable analog tester. The three types of tests produced good results and show that the digital test system does characterize yarn break strength for different types of yarn. It overcomes many disadvantages of analog systems and performs certain tasks which these systems are unable to perform."
"There are numerous occasions in applied sciences where there is need to analyze multicomponent signals formed by a linear superposition of functions having the same shape and location but different widths and amplitudes. A fast digital technique capable of producing the spectrum, i.e., the distribution of component amplitudes versus component widths, of such experimental data is presented in this paper. The method described does not require any a priori numerical information regarding the composition of the signal, can be easily and efficiently implemented on digital computers, can be automated, and is essential for an automated interpretation of these types of laboratory data. The technique is based upon a nonlinear change of variables followed by a deconvolution. A low-pass filtering is necessary in the final stage of data processing to reduce the effect of computational and experimental noise. As a main example of the practical implementation of this technique within a laboratory environment, the paper details its usage in connection with pulsed NMR measurements on malignant tissues, where the data have the form of a superposition of exponential decays."
"The design procedure along with design curves for specifying the design of analog and digital filters for mass spectrometer data is presented. In developing the procedure, careful attention is given to noise models so that the two filter classes can be compared. The use and benefits of interactive graphics and computer-aided design software for implementing the design procedures are discussed."
"The design of nonrecursive and recursive digital filters using linear least squares or linear minimum variance is described. This method of design requires a model, and since polynomial approximations are widely used in laboratory automation, a polynomial state model is first utilized. Then an exact scalar signal model is employed that results in a completely time-varying filter. For both models, the design leads to the recursive Kalman filter. The operation of the filters for noise reduction is first demonstrated for simulated data, and design forms are compared. For the exact scalar signal model, noise reduction and peak separation are demonstrated using simulated data and data obtained from a mass spectrometer. By using the correct model, excellent peak separation and noise reduction can be obtained."
"A computer-automated laboratory system at the University of Missouri-Rolla, Rolla, which serves a wide variety of instruction and research disciplines including Geophysics, Cloud Physics, and Computer Graphics, is described. The system serves as an example for campuses which are relatively small in geographic area and with budget limitations which dictate a step-by-step evolution. The paper describes 1) the constraints and economics realized in the development of the system, 2) the characteristics of the minicomputer network, and 3) an evaluation of the system philosophy and performance. Also included is a description of diverse laboratory projects supported by the computer-automated system."
"The objective of this investigation was 1) to develop a methodology for determining potential productivity increases and cost savings to be realized from computerized automation of laboratory instruments, and 2) to evaluate the cost effectiveness of increased automation in the IBM San Jose Research Laboratory, using the developed methodology. The various factors are discussed which were considered in arriving at an algorithm for calculating cost and productivity for both manually operated and automated instruments. The algorithm is defined explicitly. The results of a survey using this methodology are presented. The survey covered 75 experiments involving 57 instruments, a number of which have been connected to a computer for several years. The instruments considered include gas-liquid and gel permeation chromatographs, mass spectrometers, IR and optical spectrometers, micro-densitometers, electron spectrometers (Auger and microprobe), X-ray spectrometers, thermal analyzers, NMR spectrometers, miscellaneous instruments, and a variety of custom-built experimental apparatus. The distribution of cost for various instrument categories is presented. Automation cost and the underlying assumptions are discussed in detail. The particular implementation considered in the survey is based on a sensor-based computer (IBM System/7) which is shared by several experiments and in turn linked to a general-purpose host computer (IBM 360) for progrmn preparation and extensive data analysis. The results obtained indicate significant cost savings for about 80 percent of the experiments considered. The remaining 20 percent for which automation could be justified only on the basis of increased produtivity are also dissussed. The distribution of automation costs points up the relatively high cost associated with the deveolpment of applicatiom programs. The fairly consistent distribution of cost for a wide variety of experiments suggests that the cost savings and the calculated increase in productivity due to automation could be expected in other multi-instrument laboratories."
"In laboratory automation, the computer is used for a variety of tasks including data acquisition, data analysis, control, and report and graph generation. For automation to be successful, it is necessary to carefully generate system specifications and to proceed to an implementation design before becoming concerned about the actual computer. This forces the design team to consider the requirements to handle and process data without the constraints of a specific computer. For real-time applications, two key specifications are time response and bandwidth. In this paper, these quantities are defined, and their effect on the operation of a computer system is discussed. A detailed example of an actual system is then presented to illustrate how time response and bandwidth are handled."
"A set of hardware modules collectively called the research device coupler (RDC) has been designed to bring instrumentation interfacing capability to scientists using interactive terminal-oriented systems. The scientist familiar with APL, Fortran, PL/1, or Basic may now exercise the digital and analog I/O facilities of the RDC using these high-level languages. The RDC is an ensemble of modular I/O units with built-in functions which act with, or as, a terminal. Its primary distinction is that it takes advantage of existing interactive systems without need for change either to the host system hardware or software or to the user's terminal"

"Two single operational amplifier analog computer simulations of a class of voltage transfer functions having negative real poles are derived using Rathore's decomposition. The procedure reported is such that the functions with distinct negative real poles can be realized with either polarity, while the remaining functions of the class considered can be realized with one particular polarity only."
"A computer simulation that solves Adler's generalized equation describing the interaction of an injected signal with a free running oscillator is presented [1]. The simulation, performed on a digital computer, offers the advantage of a fast turn-around, great flexibility, and a high degree of accuracy. In contrast to analog computer simulations, no scaling is required. The simulation is demonstrated by determining the injection locking properties of an avalanche diode oscillator and of a pulsed magnetron with injected CW signals. The results concerning avalanche diode oscillator injection locking are in good agreement with other computational methods reported in current literature. The injection locking simulation of pulsed magnetrons, the results of the simulation, appear to confirm experimental data reported in the literature."

"The theoretical and empirical approaches to biological effects of microwaves are discussed. The bioeffects should be considered as a chain of events: primary interaction analyzed in terms of biophysics and early direct, early indirect, late (delayed) effects analyzed in terms of physiology. Thermal balance experiments are discussed pointing out the necessity to take unequal deep body heating by microwaves into account. The use of physiologic rhythms in microwave bioeffects experimentation is presented. Possible use of pharmacodynamic approaches (simultaneous use of drugs and microwave exposure) is outlined. Possible ways of developing biological response microwave dosimetry are indicated. Unexplained effects are pointed out and the necessity of further experiments to clarify these stressed. Some possible experimental models are presented."
"Some of the threats to the integrity of multiuser teleprocessing systems and to the data they contain can be countered by the use of cryptography. Stream-generator ciphers are not ideally suited for such an application, thus the use of block ciphers, which have the beneficial property of a strong nonlinear intersymbol dependence, is suggested. This property provides the means for automatic error detection for verifying the authenticity of terminal operators, and for ensuring messase integrity. An experimental demonstration system has been constructed to illustrate protection features that can be provided for real applications."
"The internal control of a computer is directed by the instruction. The instruction causes a sequence of steps (or microinstructions) to occur which interpret the instruction. This interpretation of an instruction can be implemented by a storage media called a control store. The programs written for this media are called microprograms. The recent availability of fast READ-WRITE bipolar storage media now makes possible the rapid changing of content of this storage and hence makes possible computer organizations which can interpret a wide variety of different types of instructions. These computer organizatios are called soft machine architectures. It is also possible to conceive of new \"machine languages\" or directly executable languages which are specially developed as an intermediate level between a specific higher level language and the microprogrammable machine."
"The major technological requirements for fusion power, as implied by current conceptual designs of fusion power plants, are elucidated and assessed. As the point of departure, the four fusion reactor concepts which have been most thoroughly considered in these design studies are described; they are the mirror, the theta-pinch, the tokamak, and the laser-pellet concepts. The required technology is discussed relative to three principal areas of concern: 1) the power balance, that is, the unique power-handling requirements associated with the production of electrical power by fusion; 2) reactor design, focusing primarly on the requirements imposed by a tritium-based fuel cycle, thermal-hydraulic considerations, and magnet systems; and 3) materials considerations, including surface erosion, radiation effects, materials compatibility, and neutron-induced activation. The major conclusions are summarized in a final section where it is noted that research and development programs have been initiated to satisfy the technological requirements associated with the realization of commercial fusion power."

"This letter describes the development of a medium-power high-efficiency high-reliability double-drift-region silicon IMPATT diode intended for use in telecommunication satellites at 11-13 GHz. The design is based on large-signal computer simulations. The highest efficiency obtained is 15.1 percent. A pilot reliability test has accumulated 7700 dc device hours at 270°C with no failures. During screening, 6000 RF device hours with no failures at approximately 180°C were also noted."
"For n- and p-type Si IMPATT diodes, the effect of the doping profile of the heavier doped junction side was calculated in terms of the dc-to-RF efficiency. In p-type diodes, the electric field existing within this region leads to a decrease in efficiency. This effect is assumed to be one reason why the theoretically expected high efficiencies of these diodes have not been obtained experimentally."
"High-frequency reverse bias measurements are made on sandwiched evaporated oxide films of tungsten and molybdenum. The linearity of the capacitance-voltage pilot gives an indication of Schottky-type barrier. The intercept and the n values obtained from the plot are used to calculate the thickness of the space charge region. It is concluded that a compound barrier exists at the interface."
"The history of the FIR filter approximation problem, as recently presented by Rabiner, McClellan, and Parks, is deficient in some areas and misleading in others. Some corrections are suggested. In addition to a brief discussion of different approaches to the design of FIR digital filters, areas into which present methods can be readily extended are outlined.

"Bias and temperature stress measurements have been used to study the effect of11B ion implantation into MOS structures. The boron energies were selected so that the projected range of the implanted distribution was approximately equal to the device oxide thickness. Boron ion doses ranged from 1011to 2 × 1012/cm2. The bias temperature stress consisted of 106V/cm applied at 300°C for 5 min. In all cases, the stability of the implanted capacitors was found to be significantly improved over the unimplanted."
"A new microwave BARITT diode structure which utilizes an intentionally added retarding-field region is presented. By taking advantage of the carrier diffusion at low velocities in this region, the injected current is delayed relative to the ac voltage and improved efficiency diodes are obtained. Microwave CW oscillation at C band with efficiency of ∼4 percent has been realized. Although the efficiency is improved over previous BARITT diodes, it is believed that considerable further improvements are possible by further optimization."

"Some fifty years ago, the first experiments were conducted that provided unequivocal evidence for the existence of an electrically charged region in the upper atmosphere capable of reflecting radio waves. Appleton and Barnett, in England, and Breit and Tuve, in the United States, conducted expeximents in which the height of the reflecting layer could be reduced. They observed echoes from several heights between 100 and 200 km. Some years later Watson-Watt coined the term ionosphere for this reflecting region. These early experiments led to the development of instruments, known as vertical-incidence sounders or ionosondes, to perform routine sounding of the reflection characteristic of the ionosphere, and a worldwide network of sounders continues in operation. The results these instruments obtained constituted the most important source of information on the properties of the atmosphere above 100-km altitude prior to about 1950, when high-altitude rocket research became practical. In the last 25 years, there has been an explosive growth in our knowledge of the properties of the upper atmosphere raising from in situ measurements made with rockets and satellites. Radio-wave investigations have continued to make very important contributions, however, owing to the development of a new sounding technique known as incoherent scatter. In this method a very-high-power VHF or UHF radar is employed to observe the weak signals backscattered by density fluctuations in the ionosphere resulting from the random thermal motion of the electrons and ions. Unlike the older reflection technique, this permits the variation of the electron concentration to be measured to very great altitudes (≥ 10 000 km); moreover, the temperatures of the electrons and the ions may be determined separately. Over certain altitude ranges the following additional information may be obtained: the concentration, temperature, and horizontal wind velocity of the neutral particles; the intensity and direction of the polarization electric field (established by the neutral wind and/or the interaction of plasma from the sun with the geomagnetic field); the transport of ionization and heat to, or from, the magnetosphere (i.e., the outermost portion of the ionized envelope surrounding the earth); information on the production of photoelectrons by the sun. The paper provides a brief summary of the early reflection experiments, and outlines the principles and practice of the new method. The power of the incoherent scatter technique is illustrated by examples of recent results. In conclusion, current plans to construct large new radars to study the auroral ionosphere are described."
"This paper presents a low-frequency method for target identification, and its effectiveness is demonstrated for a large variety of objects varying in complexity from spheres and cubes to modern airplanes. The selection of an appropriate discrete set of frequencies led to a low misclassification error. A number of classification methods are examined using this discrete set of frequencies. It is shown that simple objects can be adequately classified by a linear discriminant method. For more complex targets, such as aircraft, a nearest neighbor approach is required. The introduction of phase and orthogonal polarization components further decreased misclassification error. A discussion of the tradeoff between the increased complexity and improved performance of various classification alternatives is provided."
"An overview is given of the design criteria applicable to a variable-speed dc drive with dual-converter power supply. The control strategy, machine-converter and controller transfer functions, the problems associated with discontinuous conduction, and power flow reversal are considered. A representative bibliography of the voluminous literature on this topic is included."
"The most recent developments on the propagation of optical beams in a turbulent medium, such as the clear atmosphere, are reviewed. Among the phenomena considered are beam spreading, beam wander, loss of coherence, scintillations, angle-of-arrival variations, and short-pulse effects."
"This paper describes the concept of adaptive noise cancelling, an alternative method of estimating signals corrupted by additive noise or interference. The method uses a \"primary\" input containing the corrupted signal and a \"reference\" input containing noise correlated in some unknown way with the primary noise. The reference input is adaptively filtered and subtracted from the primary input to obtain the signal estimate. Adaptive filtering before subtraction allows the treatment of inputs that are deterministic or stochastic, stationary or time variable. Wiener solutions are developed to describe asymptotic adaptive performance and output signal-to-noise ratio for stationary stochastic inputs, including single and multiple reference inputs. These solutions show that when the reference input is free of signal and certain other conditions are met noise in the primary input can be essentiany eliminated without signal distortion. It is further shown that in treating periodic interference the adaptive noise canceller acts as a notch filter with narrow bandwidth, infinite null, and the capability of tracking the exact frequency of the interference; in this case the canceller behaves as a linear, time-invariant system, with the adaptive filter converging on a dynamic rather than a static solution. Experimental results are presented that illustrate the usefulness of the adaptive noise cancelling technique in a variety of practical applications. These applications include the cancelling of various forms of periodic interference in electrocardiography, the cancelling of periodic interference in speech signals, and the cancelling of broad-band interference in the side-lobes of an antenna array. In further experiments it is shown that a sine wave and Gaussian noise can be separated by using a reference input that is a delayed version of the primary input. Suggested applications include the elimination of tape hum or turntable rumble during the playback of recorded broad-band signals and the automatic detection of very-low-level periodic signals masked by broad-band noise."
 "The Chebyshev coefficients of cascaded nonlinearities are evaluated in terms of the series coefficients of the component stages. For near-linear cases, the possability of spectral similarity with the input stage is indicated."
 "The problem of reducing sensitivity to variations of the open-loop system parameters is considered for the case where the objective is to design a feedback controller which drives the open-loop eigenvalues to desired positions. The results are based on the assumption that the open-loop multivariable system is transformed to a phase-variable canonical form prior to the application of the control design procedure."
 "A recent conjecture on stability [1] is verified for a class of second-order systems and for a third-order system model."
"Characterstic of electromagnetic pulse transmission in homogeneous spherical models of human and animal heads are studied as a function of time and position. The incident pulse waveform is described by a triple exponential waveform which exhibits close agreement with measured pulse shapes. The transmitted pulse is shown to be proportional to the time rate of change of the incident pulse, with peak occuring at the leading surface of the spheres."
"Pure-sense complementary sequences are an important class of codes that were invented by Golay. With but two non-trivial exceptions, Golay codes of all known lengths are, or can be, made to be decomposable; that is, they can be considered to be formed from the apposition of two equal-length subcodes. Hence the technique in this letter applies to Golay codes of most known lengths. The value of the property is that it reduces the labor of computation of the autocorrelation function sidelobes of the Golay codes by a factor of at least two. Furthermore, it is applicable to either marine or manual calculation. It also provides another way of analyzing auto-correlation functions in general."
"An exact solution for the transient reflected wave from a lossy magnetoplasma half-space is derived for the case of a vertically incident impulsive plane wave. The solution is expressed as an infnite series of modified Bessel functions of the first kind with complex argument. For small values of the collision and magnetic parameters, the exact solution is approximated in terms of a single integer-order Bessel function."

"A new active RC circuit realization of a third-order low-pass Butterworth characteristic, in which not only all the resistors and capacitors are of equal value but also all the capacitors are grounded, is described. From the fabrication viewpoint, the proposed circuit is superior to the circuits of Huelsman, Dutta Roy and Malik, and Krishna Gopal. From the sensitivity viewpoint, the proposed circuit is superior to the Huelsman circuit and compares favorably with the circuits of Dutta Roy and Malik, and Krishna Gopal."
"Experimental results on the directionality of a surface wave excited by a three-phase interdigital transducer are presented. The transducer has the characterstic of a bandpass filter with two center frequencies. The propagation direction of the excited surface wave is reversed by changing the carrier frequency."
"It is shown that the method of edge waves (MEW) [1] (or \"physical theory of diffraction\") describes the secondary edge waves correctly. Opposing statement found in [2]-[4] results from some misunderstanding. It is noted that both MEW and the geometrical theory of diffraction may predict, at best, only the first two terms in an asymptotic expansion (with k → ∞) of the sum of the edge waves for real three-dimensional bodies. Some formulas dealing with MEW in [1] are defined more precisely."

"We have developed two compact flat TV sets and a full-color prototype model, using thin matrix dc gas-discharge panels of novel structure. The display panel is ¼ in thick, has a 7-in diagonal picture size, and contains 60 000 elements. The monochrome version has a peak luminance of 25 fL, a contrast ratio of 40:1, and 32 digitized gray levels, while the full-color set has a luminance of 5 fL, a 20:1 contrast ratio, and 48 levels. Luminance control is performed by varying the magnitude as well as the duration of the display current. All signals are digitized and all circuits consist of TTL IC's, with the exception of the drive transistors. We have constructed two types of experimental monochrome model sets: one for desk-top use packaged in a 300 × 350 × 80 mm housing which includes tuner, A/D converter, and all TV circuits with the exception of a power supply, the other for wall hanging. A full-color flat display panel has also been developed using a similar panel structure and circuitry."
"The temperature dependence of the turn-on voltage of gold-doped and control n- and p-channel MOSFETs has been measured. To account for the large positive shift of turn-on voltage, VT Au, of gold treated n- and p-channel devices, it has been proposed that the gold eliminates the fast interface traps of continuous energy distribution, and that additional acceptor states very close to the valence band can cause additional charge QA Au, which can dominate the effect of acceptor and donor levels of gold ions in the silicon surface space charge region, and can also over-compensate the surface state charge, Qss. To fit the theoretical VT Auversus T curve to experimental curves, an accumulation of electrically active gold within the surface space charge region has been considered in n-channel devices and depletion in p-channel devices."
"The effect of the emitter doping gradient on the transit time in microwave bipolar transistor structures has been investigated. The range of gradients was chosen to cover those typically found in shallow phosphorus- and arsenic-emitter diffusions. The results show that there is appreciable free carrier storage in the emitter space charge layer. The Storage decreases when the doping gradient in the junction is increased. This effect can account for the improved fTvalues of arsenic emitter transistors. The free carrier storage in the emitter space charge layer is compared with predictions deduced from the theoretical analysis of Morgan and Smits [1]."
"The temperature rise in silicon devices under pulsed power conditions is calculated by a numerical method which takes into account the nonlinear properties of the materials. Power is assumed to be dissipated in a thin but finite layer at the surface of a one-dimensional structure. The effect of various types of heat sinks on the peak temperature rise is shown."
"In a fast-scan mode of addressing a matrix of m rows and n columns, in which the columns are scanned, contrast is optimized by maximizing the ratio of the rms voltage at a selected intersection to that at a nonselected one. A simple derivation shows that the address-pulse amplitude should be taken proportional to n1/2. We apply this result to the twisted nematic case."
"It was found experimentally that the pulsewidth of popcorn noise has a dependence on the emitter current density. Experimental results show that, when a transistor having popcorn noise is operated at the emitter current density less than about 1.56 × 10-1A/cm2, the popcorn-noise characteristic is scarcely in the frequency range higher than 15 Hz, well below the audible frequency limit."

"A GaAs:Si-GaAsP heterostructure chip coated with NaYF4:Yb,Er phosphor has been fabricated to demonstrate multicolor operation. The one-chip light-emitting diodes (LED's) with double junctions showed a centrosymmetrical distribution of green-and red-light intensities. An intermediate hue between green and red was achieved by adjusting the thickness of the phosphor. The luminance of each color was more than 100 fL at a current density of 30 A/cm2and the power efficiency was 2-3 × 10-4for green. The luminance of the green light was less than 250 fL at 20 A/cm2for a single GaAs:Si LED because of the refraction of infrared light in the GaAsP layer."
"n-channel and p-channel silicon-gate FET's are fabricated using a 300-Å SiO2-300-Å Si3N4gate insulator. These devices have low leakage and are suitable for dynamic FET-memory applications. Very low n-channel leakage is achieved by using an n- or p-doped polycrystalline-silicon field shield. One-device dynamic memory cells exhibit long average retention times: 158 s for the n-channel cell and 34 s for the p-channel cell. An oxygen or steam anneal of the Si3N4is necessary to prevent a large Vtshift during bias-temperature stress."
"The most important characteristic of a charge-coupled device is its charge transfer efficiency (CTE). There are three basic types of loss which degrade CTE: fixed loss, proportional loss, and nonlinear loss. Examples are given of each type of loss and techniques for measurement of all three types of loss are described. A method of determining the minimum fat zero which eliminates fixed loss is shown and an experiment is presented which confirms that fixed loss due to surface states can be completely eliminated by the use of a fat zero. The effect of interelectrode gaps on CTE is discussed in detail. A nonlinear loss model is used to describe the dispersion due to barriers in the gaps and the very detrimental effect of wells in the gap region is shown. The techniques presented in the analysis of these losses are very general and can be used whenever a detailed description of the transfer loss mechanism is required."
"Noise temperature data from argon plasmas at 1-50 mmHg are given. Similarity is shown to exist when the discharge currents are scaled according to a constant current/radius ratio. The consequences of the new method of scaling are discussed."
"A simple model for the behavior of the collector capacitance of bipolar transistors has been developed with the aim of studying high-level injection phenomena in epitaxial collectors. The Collector capacitance (Cc) calculated from the results of a dynamic small-signal measurement. It is Observed that Ccincreases by more than an order of magnitude as the collector current is increased from a low value into the quasi-saturation regime at a fixed collector-emitter voltage of 1 V. The collector capacitance is composed of a transition capacitance, which is due to the presence of unneutralized charges in the collector region, and of a diffusion capacitance, which is due to the presence of neutralized charge in transit across the base and the collector regions. The transition capacitance is the dominant component at low-current levels. However, at high-current levels, the diffusion capacitance predominates if the one, dimensional \"base-widening\" model (Kirk effect) becomes operative and the total capacitance becomes very large. This capacitance is found to be about an order of magnitude larger than that expected if the two-dimensional \"lateral-spreading\" model were dominant. Good agreement is observed between the experimental data and the theoretical Ccestimates using the one-dimensional model. Thus it is concluded that the base-widening model controls the behavior of our devices at high levels of injection in the collector."
"In this letter, we demonstrate that the degree to which the nonuniformity in the heat sinking affects the current distribution in a power transistor can be quickly, nondestructively, and unambiguously ascertained by observing the bias dependence of the recombination radiation emitted by the transistor. This technique is more sensitive than the more conventional thermal imaging where thermal diffusion tends to wash out the relevant nonuniformities at the low power levels."
"A novel MNOSFET device structure has been demonstrated to solve a serious problem with MNOS memory devices. The new structure eliminates the parasitic FET devices which are formed in parallel with the variable threshold MNOSFET when the conventional device structure is used."
"Measurements of the MIS capacitance as a function of voltage were carried out on aluminum-sapphire-silicon structures. The results were used to determine the doping of the silicon and the interface-state density and flat-band charge density at the silicon-sapphire interface. The density of states function Ds(cm-2eV-1) is found to be qualitatively similar to that reported for the Si-SiO2interface but is larger in magnitude by a factor of 5-10."
"Electron-hole plasma propagation in the lateral direction of a thyristor is slowed down by emitter shunts. The lifetimes of the device also influence the plasma-spreading velocity. These phenomena are observed by taking time-resolved pictures of recombination radiation emission from the device."
"An expression for the rise and decay times of vidicon photocurrents as a function of incident illumination is derived for a certain class of vidicon photoconductors. The approach taken is semiempirical in that certain parameters in the derived expression are obtained directly from vidicon manufacturer's data sheets. Regults compare well with the manufacturer's published results."

"It is shown that the two-dimensional potential variation in buried-channel CCD's can be considered to arise from a number of linearly contributing components. The components arising from the lateral variation in the gate voltage, depletion charge, and signal charge are clearly identified. Both the one- and two-level insulator structures are considered, and it is shown that the two-level structure can be reduced to an equivalent one-level device thereby greatly simplifying the analysis. Simple solutions are obtained for the potential and field variations in the channel region of both types of structure for zero signal charge. From these results, device optimization procedures aimed at minimizing the transfer inefficiency are obtained and applied to one-and two-level CCD's."
"The dynamic properties of a metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor are simulated using numerical techniques. Time-dependent behavior of the electrons and holes is obtained for large-signal transient applications in the presence of deep-lying Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination centers. The computation is performed throughout the entire device including both the insulator and semiconductor materials. Self-consistent implicit numerical algorithms were developed to solve simultaneously the exact time-dependent continuity equations for electrons and holes, Poisson's equation for the electrostatic potential and the rate equations for both donor- and acceptor-type SRH centers. Stable solutions are obtained for the transient response from flatband to strong inversion which ranges over many decades of time. The results include the simulation of the transient response of a thin substrate MOS capacitor from flatband to inversion. The computer results are explained and compared to the existing theories of transient MOS capacitance. Wherever possible, comparisons of computed results are made for the cases with and without the inclusion of SRH recombination centers. The main results point out the deficiencies in the existing interpretation of the Zerbst plot and offer alternative explanations."
"Thin-film cermet resistance strain gauges provide gauge factors of the order of 15, while providing higher stability than achievable with discontinuous thin-film metallic strain gauges. Strain-sensitive cermet resistors can be incorporated advantageously into thin-film distributed parameter notch filters. This results in a highly sensitive strain-sensing device which can be fabricated by a simple process germain to the thin-film microelectronic technology."
"Failure of the reverse characteristic of power devices may be caused by an increase of field strength due to doping inhomogeneities. A numerical program has been developed to calculate the effect of various types of perturbations on the maximum occurring field strength and on the shape of the space charge region. Three-dimensional calculations show that the influence of inhomogeneities can partly be compensated by the surrounding material. On the other hand, spikes of the diffusion front or p-islands with a high doping concentration inside the lowly doped n-region may cause an increase of field strength, which is not expected from the one-dimensional model."
"This paper presents a small-signal theory of a two-dimensional domain initiation in a bulk effect device, and discussions are focused on a transverse extension of the initial domain. It is introduced that the transverse extension velocity is not so fast as compared with the longitudinal propagation velocity in a stage of the domain initiation. This is because the longitudinal propagation velocity is much faster than the stable domain propagation velocity, although the transverse extension velocity is also faster than the mature domain velocity. It is necessary to estimate a marginal distance for an immature domain to travel in a domain growth time when a logic element utilizing the transverse extension of the high field domain is designed."
"A two-dimensional computer-aided analysis on the domain dynamics in a planar Gunn device with a Schottky-barrier gate has been performed both for the repeatedly nucleated-domain mode (continuous operation) and for the triggered single-domain mode (triggered operation). The difference in the domain behavior between planar devices with coplanar ohmic electrodes and with parallel ohmic electrodes leads to a conclusion that the edge effect caused by the current crowding at the anode deteriorates the switching speed associated with the domain formation and extinction on the planar Gunn device with the coplanar electrodes. It is shown how a domain is nucleated under the gate, travels to the anode, and disappears there in the presence of the two-dimensional effects. The mechanism of the Schottky-gate triggering on the reverse-biased condition which differs substantially from the FET model has been made clear."
"The electrical characteristics of long inhomogeneous bulk negative differential mobility (NDM) semiconductor elements (n-GaAs and n-InP) exhibiting various modes of current instabilities at low microwave frequencies have been experimentally observed. Measurements were made of the time-dependent sample current and voltage and of the prethreshold electric-field distribution within the sample. The measurements were made under conditions in which the configuration of the circuit, the properties of the boundary of the NDM element, the sample geometry, the temperature, and the magnetic field were varied. We have obtained excellent agreement between the experimental results and a model in which the sample is assumed to have an assigned value for the electric field at the cathode boundary. Different modes of instability may be accurately modeled by choosing an appropriate value for this field. Three regions of behavior may be identified which correspond to three regions for the cathode boundary field. These regions are 1) cathode boundary field Ecless than the threshold electric field Epfor the onset of NDM; the samples are likely to operate as bulk oscillators, 2)E_{c} > E_{p}but less than the electric field Evcorresponding to the onset of the saturated electron-drift velocity; the samples operate in the Gunn domain mode with a peak-to-valley ratio determined by Ec, and 3)E_{c} > E_{v}the samples yield saturating current versus voltage curves and only weak oscillations are possible."
"A new circuit for TRAPATT operation of avalanche diodes has been fabricated and tested. Operation of diodes in the circuit has also been studied via computer simulation. Results are given in this paper and discussion is given on the internal dynamics of the field shock-front formation, based on the computer simulation. The major features of the new TRAPATT oscillator are 1) that TRAPATT oscillation can start without delay, and hence the oscillator is useful for short-pulse operation, 2) that TRAPATT oscillation can be sustained at a relatively low current, and CW operation may be possible, and 3) that the TRAPATT frequency is a decreasing function of the bias current."
"After a brief review of relevant device parameters, characterizing the inversely operating multicollector n-p-n transistor and the lateral p-n-p transistor which make up anI^{2}Lbasic cell, some electronic circuit properties of this gate are discussed quantitively. Analytic expressions are derived for the transfer characteristics, the noise margin and the propagation delay time per gate in relation to the cell geometry, fan-out, doping profiles, and recombination properties. These expressions are compared with experimental and numerical circuit simulation results."
"This correspondence discusses the effects of transfer inefficiency on MTF (modulation transfer function) for single register readout and parallel-transfer readout of charge-coupled linear imaging devices. An analytical expression for transfer inefficiency effects on MTF for parallel-transfer arrays is derived. This expression is compared with the result for single register readout; and tile advantages of parallel-transfer readout are discussed."
"By solving the continuity equation with the assumption that the signal charge is small, an expression is obtained for the decay of charge in a three-phase CCD having a short gate length. The results help clarify some previous results on this topic."
"Investigations of the effect of ambient temperature on the RF power and frequency ofX-band p+-n-n+ Si IMPATT diodes at frequencies and temperatures below their optimum conditions show considerable degradation of performance. A simple model is presented to explain these effects in terms of a lower limit to the instantaneous terminal voltage of the diode. Values of diode negative conductance are derived from the measurements and good agreement is obtained with independent measurements. The effects are relevant to both amplitude and frequency stability in wide band applications of IMPATT diodes."

"A simple one-dimensional computer model of the dc-thermal behavior of a Schottky-barrier GaAs IMPATT diode has been formulated to compute the conditions for thermal runaway in IMPATT diodes of various designs. The model has been used to determine the thermal stability conditions for three designs of GaAs IMPATT's. The computations lead to several conclusions, the most important of which are the following. a) Junction thermionic emission (leakage) current is thermally unstable, whereas avalanche multiplication is thermally stabilizing. Diode thermal stability at high junction temperature requires that the thermionic emission current be low and the avalanche multiplication be large. b) Lowering of the barrier height caused by contaminants or defects at the junction increases the likelihood of thermal runaway. c) For a given barrier height, the higher the doping of the IMPATT diode, the more resistant it will be to thermal runaway."
"A method of detecting photosignals in solid-state image sensors is described. The technique employes bucket-brigade charge-transfer readout of a modified X-Y imaging array. This concept is further developed to cover its use in a single-pellet tricolor image sensor. A natural extension of this same bucket-brigade fan-in circuit leads to a method of mitigating the effects of white video defects in both solid-state image sensors and beam-scanned tubes."
"In 1967, it was observed by the authors that an axial magnetic field applied to a vacuum-arc discharge in a coaxial diode was capable of extinguishing the discharge. A continuing effort to develop a high-voltage dc arc interrupter has resulted in a simple, lightweight device capable of interrupting 800 A at 25 kV. Operation at higher levels was limited, not by the interrupter, but by the lack of availability of adequate power supplies. This device has been operated at repetition frequencies of several pulses per second. Successful operation at a frequency of 1 kHz has been achieved at lower power levels. The turn-on and turn-off times are, respectively, as short as one and two microseconds, The pulsewidth is continuously variable from a few microseconds to infinity (dc operation). It has been demonstrated that operation above 10 kV requires very pure materials and the use of ultra-high vacuum techniques. Among the many uses for the interrupter are those in high-power modulators and high-power inverters. An enticing future application is for switching in high-voltage dc power transmission systems."
"A charge-storage junction FET (CSJFET) has been developed which is capable of storing a charge in its gate region. The storage time can be varied in the orders of several seconds to less than one microsecond by illumination or by hole injection. This function is given by the double-layered structure of the gate region. The stored negative space charge in the floating gate region controls the channel conductance of a CSJFET. An illumination-time convertor and a variable delay-time controller are the basic applications. CSJFET's can easily be fabricated by the bipolar-IC technology."
"The reason why the usual FET shows the saturated characteristics has been shown that with increasing drain voltage, the effect of the negative feedback action, increases through a marked increase of the Series channel resistance in the neighborhood of the pinch-off voltage, under which condition the apparent transfercon-ductanceG_{m'}= G_{m}/(1 + r_{s}.G_{m})becomesG_{m'} \\simeq r_{s}^{-1}. It is also pointed out that a transistor in analogy to the vacuum type proposed by Watanabe and Nishizawa in 1950, exhibits the nonsaturated build-up character only When the internal negative feedback action is as little asG_{m'} \\simeq G_{m}. In this case, when the channel has not yet pinched off, the characteristics are ohmic and then the transistor can operate as a good variable resistor; on the other hand, when the channel has already pinched, the transistor shows the build-up characteristics similar to those of a vacuum tube triode as a result of the static induction from the drain. The transistor similar to that of the vacuum tube triode type is named \"Static Induction Transistor,\" because its output character is based on the static induction as well as input characteristics. The SIT has the exponential characteristics in contrast with the \"Analog Transistor\" which is expected by Shockley to follow the space-charge conduction law. The SIT has already been ascertained to have low noise, low distortion, and high-power capability, and its fabrication has been already realized in the form of a high-power transistor (2 kW, 8 MHz), a high-frequency transistor (a few watts, UHF), and a high-speed thyristor. Microwave transistors and very high-speed integrated circuits are being constructed, as well as variable resistors."
"A new concept for integrated planar Schottky-diodes has been developed. It meets the two important requirements in the design of microwave diodes: high cutoff frequency and low parasitics. Only one epitaxial layer is needed. The Schottky contact is deposited on the slope of a mesa in order to obtain both low series resistance and low capacitance, Up to now, a Zero-bias cutoff frequency of 150 GHz has been achieved. The advantage of this type of diodes as compared to planar diodes produced by double selective epitaxy is the use of standard technology, resulting in good reproducibility and yield."
"Hi-lo and lo-hi-lo GaAs Schottky-barrier IMPATT diodes have generated CW power outputs over 12 and 10 W, respectively, at 6 GHz. Noise measurements indicate a decreasing FM noise measure with increasing power output. The diodes are less susceptible to tuning-induced burnout than are flat-profile GaAs Impatts, having repeatedly survived input power surges over 70 W."
"A quantitative knowledge of the energy deposited by low-energy electron beams is often necessary for microelectronic applications. Three calculations of energy deposition in a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structure irradiated by a beam of 20- keV electrons are compared in this note. The error resulting from equating electron penetration to path length is illustrated."
"The effects of the presence of shielding electrodes on the electric fields in electrofluid dynamic (EFD) generator channels are studied. For each case studied, the magnitude of the field distortion is found as the ratio of the maximum electric field to the undisturbed maximum field. The electric-field magnification is derived as a function of both the relative size and sharpness of the protruding electrode and the relative size of the charge cloud. A charge-density attenuation coefficient is defined as the inverse of the electric-field magnification."

Pulser noise, correlated transfer noise, shot noise, dark current noise, and electrical insertion noise at the input have been measured and studied. The dependences of the electrical insertion noise and the transfer noise on charge packet size and clock frequency are discussed in detail and the latter related to interface state densities. New schemes and input circuits for low-noise electrical insertion of the signal charge are discussed. Our measurements indicate that the noise levels due to the intrinsic noise sources (transfer and storage noise) agree with our physical understanding of the device operation. The noise levels due to the extrinsic noise sources (pulser noise and electrical insertion noise) are above the expected theoretical values."
"Previously, all known ohmic contacts to n-GaAs have involved a so-called \"alloying\" procedure which consists of melting a Au-Ge eutectic or Sn-based alloy films on GaAs. We describe here a new contact metallization scheme consisting of Pd/Ge/n-GaAs which requires sintering rather than melting in order to produce ohmic contacts. The sintering is done at temperatures ranging from 350°C, 15 min to 500°C, 2 h depending on the doping level of n-GaAs (1018-1016cm-3. For n-1016cm-3GaAs, a specific contact resistance of 3 × 10-4Ω.cm2was achieved. Sintering leads to the formation of some PdGe and intermetallics associated with the Pd/GaAs interaction, namely, PdAs2and PdGa. Ohmic behavior is attributed to a combination of the doping action of Ge (as donor) and fast in-diffusion kinetics of Pd. Sintered contacts to n+and p+GaAs (ND.A∼ 1018cm-8) made by Au, Pt, and Ti Were also investigated for ohmic behavior. Each of these three metals was at least partially effective in forming ohmic contacts to p+GaAs; the degree of effectiveness increases on going from Ti to Au to Pt. It is proposed that a reasonable guideline to follow When searching for ohmic contacts is Xm≳ Xdwhere Xmis the width of the metallurgical junction and Xdis the ideal depletion layer width. This condition should favor ohmic contacts by promoting a micro 3-dimensional current flow at the conductor-semiconductor interface and thereby maximizing field-emission probability."
"Blooming occurs in silicon-vidicon targets because more hole-electron pairs are created at a given point by the incident light signal than can be removed by the action of the scanning electron beam. The excess carriers move laterally in the target through diffusion and, as a result, the blooming has the following properties- 1) the Slope of the blooming curve on semilog paper does not depend on the size of the incident light spot, i.e., at a given overload intensity, all circular spot sizes add the same excess amount to their radii; 2) the radius of a bloomed spot increases linearly with the log of the incident intensity; 3) the Slope of the blooming curve does not depend on beam current; however, the intensity at which the blooming begins does depend directly on the beam current. At very high incident-light intensities, a dramatic increase in the blooming is observed. This can be attributed to diffusion under conditions where the minority carrier level has become equal to the majority carrier level."
"A technique for internally shifting information stored in a plasma-display/memory panel uses a discharge-related coupling phenomenon between neighboring elements together with a three-phase electronic drive scheme. Experimental results are reported which describe quantitatively the inter-element coupling phenomenon in some commercially available panels. An electronic drive scheme which uses this phenomenon to provide a four-directional self-shift display system is described. The effects of panel nonuniformity, the nature of the noise signals encountered in this system, and typical operating characteristics of this system are discussed."
"We demonstrate from a study of the small signal impedance properties of supercritical negative differential mobility (NDM) element that the various modes of device amplification are determined primarily by cathode conditions and the bias. These conclusions are drawn from 1) a detailed analytical investigation where cathode conditions are represented by prespecified values of electric field, and 2) by synthesizing previously published studies. Briefly, it is shown that multiple (bias induced stable-unstable-stable) amplifying states will arise from NDM elements with cathode fields Ecwithin the NDM region. (Here, the different states occur when the device dc current density is, respectively, less than, approximately equal to, or greater than a critical value of current Jc. Jcis determined by Ec.) Single amplifying states will arise from elements with values of Ecthat are either less than the NDM threshold field value, or within the saturated drift velocity region. (In the latter case, time-dependent values for Ecare required.) The study proposes that general features of the space-charge profiles and the cathode conditions may be ascertained from measurements of 1) the small signal device impedance as a function of bias level, and 2) the dc current versus voltage relation."
"A new image device designed to electronically separate two kinds of color components from an optical image utilizing photoelectric properties of the surface of a silicon-vidicon target, and an economical color-TV camera using this device are proposed. This system requires neither special construction of a camera tube target to obtain index signals for color separation nor bias lighting. Crosstalk components present in the color signals from the color camera tube are corrected by circuitry. This color camera is about three times as high in sensitivity as that using an antimony trisulfide vidicon. It has many other features, including the capability of imaging a fixed object, without burn-in for a long time, as well as high reliability and long life."
"A polycrystalline silicon gate has finite sheet resistivity, typically in the range of tens of ohms per square. The resulting gate resistance and the gate capacitance form a distributed RC network. The gate voltages appearing along this distributed network, hence, the summation drain current, is delayed from the input voltage applied to the contact pad(s). The delay of the distributed RC network is analyzed for both small and large signals. The analysis shows that when the RC time constant of the gate is comparable to the period of the signal, the frequency response is degraded. This time constant varies as the square of the gate width. For a gate width in the fractional millimeter range (typical of output MOS transistors in an integrated circuit), the time constant may be in the 100-ns range; for gate width in the 10-µ range, in the subnanosecond range."
"The effects of series resistance on semiconductor doping profiles obtained by conventional CV analysis are discussed, and it is shown that this resistance can cause extremely large errors in the profiles. It is demonstrated that the existence of such errors can be inferred from suitable RF phase angle measurements obtained during the CV profiling process, and that this information can be used to correct distorted profiles. A theoretical analysis and several computer simulations are presented in order to illustrate the nature of the problem and the methods by which accurate profiles can be obtained. All of the behavior predicted by computer simulations is verified by experimental examples."
"An analytical approximation to the field distribution in the channel portion between gate and drain of the junction field-effect transistor is derived, assuming an infinitely small channel width-to-height ratio, and modified for finite channel widths by introducing an effective impurity concentration which depends on drain current. The approximation is applicable also in the limiting case of zero gate edge curvature, i.e., for Schottky-barrier gate. The theoretical field distribution is used to extract impact-ionization coefficients from published experimental data on gate current enhancement at large drain voltages. These impact-ionization coefficients agree with published data derived from bulk impact ionization."
"The drain current IDversus gate voltage VGof an MOST operating in weak inversion, and the influence of surface potential fluctuations on this characteristic have been studied before [1], [2]. The purpose of this paper is to derive an expression of the drain current IDversus the drain voltage VDfor devices with a channel length not smaller than 20 µm. It is demonstrated that the surface potential fluctuations do not affect the slope of the ID-VDcurve, whereas the density Nssof surface states strongly influences the slope for small drain voltages. This yields a simple and useful technique to determine Nsson MOS transistors."
"A technique for fabricating charge-coupled devices with submicron gaps is described. The method relies on a \"shadowing\" effect produced by oblique deposition of the metal in an otherwise standard vacuum evaporation process. The biggest advantage of the technique is its extreme simplicity, particularly for one-dimensional CCD structures. The feasibility of the technique has been demonstrated for two-and three-phase devices; the two-phase structure was a 32-bit shift register which has been operated at up to 10 MHz. With some additional processing, the technique can be used to make bidirectional CCD arrays as required in area imagers and serpentine shift registers."
"It is shown that, according to the theories of 1/f noise in MOST's by Klaassen [1] and Berz [2], the mean-square equivalent noise voltage at the gate Vgn2is proportional to the effective surface state density Nss, and not to NssVg(Vg= gate voltage), as was stated for these theories by Das and Moore. Therefore, contrary to what was concluded by Das and Moore, there is no conflict between these theories and the experimental results by Das and Moore which show that Vgn2varies with gate voltage as Nss."
"The unequal ionization rates reported for holes and electrons in GaAs have been used to calculate the small-signal admittance for a complimentary p-type IMPATT diode. For the uniformly doped n and p device structures considered, the p-type structure is found to have significantly increased negative conductance."
"New circuit arrays and systems of MOS-type monolithic clockless-A/D-converter integrated circuit have been proposed. A fabricated 5-bit monolithic clockless-A/D converter was composed of the self-scanning part associated with the continuously variable threshold voltage device (CVTD), the logic circuit part associated with the AND-GATE circuit and inverter circuit and the decoder part. The minimum converting time and the resolution accuracy for 1 bit were about 2 µs and 3.1 percent, Furthermore, the circuit system and the array, the device structure, and the electrical characteristics are discussed in details."
"A singly tuned X-band IMPATT amplifier is simulated on a hybrid computer and results are given for the amount of conduction current modulation present in the device as a function of the period, T, with the ac voltage across the diode held fixed, Using Sjolund's large-signal noise theory which relates the conduction current modulation to the noise measure, M, curves are presented showing a logarithmic relation between M and the period, T, with M increasing for larger T. An approximate theory is given to explain this behavior. These noise measure results are compared to the IMPATT power-output data to give a qualitative understanding of the rate of noise degradation with power output in relation to frequency of operation. It is shown that, for minimum noise degradation, the IMPATT should be operated at or above the frequency corresponding to maximum power output for a given ac voltage across the diode. This information can be used to establish a criterion for minimum noise degradation during intermediate and large signal operation."

"A method of setting charge in a charge-coupled device (CCD) is described whereby the input diode is suitably pulsed and an amount of charge is retained in a potential well under the first transfer electrode. It is shown that, within limits defined by the operating potentials of the device, the sizes of the generated charge packets are linearly dependent on the voltage difference between the first transfer electrode and the input gate. They are also independent of threshold voltage. The method has important applications in all CCD's where it is necessary to obtain a linear low noise charge input that is uniform from one device to another. The linearity has been demonstrated with a 64-element CCD which with a sinusoidal input shows second and third harmonics to be 40 dB down from the fundamental. Measured rms input noise was above the minimum theoretically achievable value but was still 80 dB down from the peak signal level. The electrode area was 2000 μm2. For a comprehensive review on CCD's and input circuits, see [10]."
"The influence of ionization in the drift space of an IMPATT diode on the noise generation in the avalanche process is studied. It is found that carrier generation by ionization in the drift space increases the current minima between the current pulses as generated in the avalanche region. The build-up of new avalanche current pulses therefore starts from a higher current level and consequently the behavior is less noisy. The effect of this decrease in noise on the IMPATT-diode oscillator FM noise is estimated."
"A new type of ion-implanted MOS transistor is described. The transistor functions, for example, as an integrating nondestructively readable photosensor and its technology is fully compatible with the advanced MOS integrated circuits."
"The CV profiling technique is reviewed and its validity and limitations are investigated, with special attention given to the case where the method is extended to the study of ion-implanted impurity distributions. A theoretical analysis is described which yields information about the dependence of CV measurements on impurity profile. The inverse problem is then considered and the results demonstrate that the depletion approximation formulas commonly used for the reduction of CV data to give doping profiles are misleading when applied to substrates with rapidly varying profiles as are generally the case for ion-implanted substrates. Examples of the profiles obtained for various shaped impurity distributions are given."
"The one-dimensional Poisson's equation for semiconductors doped with an ion-implanted profile (or any profile) is solved numerically using the mesh method of solution. The original equation is replaced by a set of finite difference equations. Solutions using a uniform mesh distribution together with the Störmer or the Cowell method are described. A variable mesh formulation of both the Störmer and the Cowell method is derived and is shown to give better accuracy for much smaller amounts of computation than the corresponding uniform mesh formulation."
"An avalanche generation model is developed and incorporated into computer circuit analysis programs SLIC and NICAP. A modified form of Miller's empirical expression for generation is found to agree well with measured data for Western Electric and commercial n-p-n transistors. Measurement techniques and parameter determination for the three model coefficients are discussed. Equation constraints appropriate for computer implementation are presented."
"A two-dimensional numerical analysis for the turnoff of a bipolar transistor from high injection level (VBE= 900 mV) is carried out. VBCis being kept constant at 1 V. Distributions of potential, electron, and hole density are interpreted and lead to a subdivision of the total transient time into four time regions, each governed by a single phenomenon. These phenomena are 1) fast discharge of the sidewall transistor, 2) the \"lateral wave\" which has the dominating influence in the total switching time, 3) the vertical discharge, and 4) the emitter discharge. The transient behavior is essentially ruled by two-dimensional lateral effects. Hence one-dimensional models are not adequate for switching a transistor out of saturation."
"Integrated injection-logic (I2L) cells were tested to determine their characteristics after exposure to a total dose gamma-radiation environment. These particular devices were not designed or fabricated with radiation hardness as a goal. The common-base current gain of the lateral p-n-p transistor, the common-emitter current gain of the vertical n-p-n transistor and the forward current-voltage characteristics of the injector-substrate junction were measured over the current range of 100 nA to 300 µA as a function of dose. In addition, the propagation delay time versus power dissipation per gate at various dose levels was determined from frequency of oscillation measurements of a multiple inverter circuit."
"Formulas are presented which show that arbitrarily short-channel length for an insulated-gate field-effect transistor does not lead to arbitrarily large transconductance. Instead, the Boltzmann limit is indicated."
"The authors attempt to characterize second breakdown as heating phenomena which can occur in one of two places, either at the p-n interface at low current or at the n-n+interface at higher current. The transition point between these two states occurs at a current It= qVsatNDS where the n-region field is uniform and at a voltage Vt= εsatWepijust necessary to saturate the drift velocity in Wepi."
"Fabrication of ion-implanted germanium IGFET's is described. The characteristics of the devices are reported and the measured channel mobilities are related to annealing procedures for reducing interface state density. Charged oxide traps and interface states near the band edges scatter minority carriers in the channel and thus are responsible for reduction of the channel mobility."
"Since a traveling high-field domain in a high-resistivity n-GaAs diode is composed of charges by trapped carriers, it does not easily disappear even after the external conditions to generate it are removed. By using this property of the domain, the diode is operated as a memory device."
"Monte Carlo calculations of electron transport in InP and GaAs short-channel field-effect transisters (FET's) show that a significant departure from the equilibrium velocity-field curve occurs in these devices. On the basis of these calculations, InP FET's should have high-frequency performance superior to that of GaAs FET's only for effective channel lengths in excess of 1.5 µ."
"Experimental results show that it is possible to fabricate dual-gate GaAs FET's, with Lg1= 0.6 µm and Lg2= 1.3 µm, using conventional photoprocessing equipment, masks, and alignment tolerances. The initial source mesa establishes both the source and drain edges during the ohmic contact metal deposition. These two edges establish the lengths and positions of the two gates in the channel, during the two subsequent evaporations. Initial experimental devices gave reasonably good small-signal microwave performance: 8-dB packaged net gain with less than 6-dB simultaneous noise figure, at 6 GHz."
"An EBS (electron bombarded semiconductor) pulse amplifier which generates high-current fast-risetime variable-width pulses into low impedance loads is described. Current pulses of 100 A into a 1-Ω load have been obtained with a risetime of 2.2 ns. A di/dt of 40 000 A/µs and a dV/dt of 71 000 V/µs have been obtained. Pulse lengths to 1 µs at 0.1-percent duty have been achieved. The risetime and peak current capabilities are presently limited by internal circuit parasitics. Without parasistics, the theoretical peak output capabilities for this EBS are 340 A with a di/dt of 6 × 105A/µs."
"Optimum transit angles for maximum output power in the millimeter-wave IMPATT diodes are calculated analytically by considering the carrier diffusion process through the space-charge region. It is found that the optimum transit angle decreases, as the space-charge layer width reduces. The theoretical results show satisfactory agreement with the previously published experimental results for Si p+-n-n+abrupt junction diodes."
"Experimental evidence is presented which shows that IGFET transconductance/current ratios can approach bipolar values."

 "A brief review is given of approaches to lithography for microdevice fabrication. Exposure systems in common use, as well as those in development, are described and assessed. These include contact and proximity printing, stationary and scanning projection printing, step-and-repeat reduction printing, scanning electron beam systems, electron imaging systems, and X-ray systems."
"An electron beam machine is described, in which the ¼-µm diameter beam is computer controlled to define integrated circuit and other fine patterns at their final size in response to a coordinate data input. Electron sensitive resist is exposed on metallized quartz or glass substrates. Resist development followed by metal etching enables masks to be made, either for subsequent photolithography or, more usually, for use in the electron image projector developed by J. P. Scott. The mask drawing process is entirely automatic and the emphasis is on the rapid generation of complex patterns with high precision. A two-stage deflection system enables rectangular pattern elements to be drawn at a 10-MHz stepping rate and accurately positioned throughout a 2-mm square main deflection field. Patterns are automatically positioned, to an accuracy of ±1/8 µm, relative to an array of markers predeposited on the substrate. The beam is also refocused automatically at the markers. A mechanical stage for the substrate enables 50 × 50-mm arrays of patterns to be built up. A complete mask containing detail as small as 1 µm takes 1-3 h to draw. Finer patterns can be drawn, although more slowly."
"An electron beam exposure system (EBES) has proven to be practical and economic for generating high-quality fine-featured integrated circuit masks. It is also capable of exposing patterns directly on resist-coated silicon wafers and, when so used, is an effective tool with which to develop new semiconductor devices. EBES combines continuous translation of the mask or wafer substrate with periodic deflection of the electron beam in a raster-scan mode of exposure. Substrate position is monitored by means of laser interferometers. The strategy permits both the electronic and mechanical subsystems to work well within their limits of capability and contributes to system reliability. It also permits the system to be stepped up to higher resolution and faster exposure as brighter electron sources, more sensitive resist, and faster data processing techniques are developed."
"Successful application of high-speed scanning electron lithography machines such as the electron beam exposure system (EBES) requires the development of suitable materials and processes. We describe how electron resists with improved sensitivity have been used to make high-quality photolithographic master masks in which 1-µm lines and spaces are resolved and also to make MOS integrated circuits with improved packing density and performance."
"Methods are presented for using two-dimensional (axially symmetric) aperture lenses of both the single- and multiaperture (fly's-eye) kind and one-dimensional (planar-symmetric) aperture lenses in image-projection systems for electron lithography. The basic electron-optical properties of such aperture lenses are derived. The ancillary film technology is discussed, including pre-exposure and postexposure resist processes in use and the techniques developed for fabricating electron-transmission object masks that can withstand the requisite electron bombardment during image projection. The image-projection systems developed for use in fabricating arrays of thin-film field emitters, electron-beam-addressed memory planes, optical waveguides, and interdigital transducers (unapodized and apodized) for surface-acoustic-wave devices are described, and representative examples of each device produced are shown."
"An electron image projector for silicon device processing is described which uses an air-cored solenoid and a caesium iodide photocathode. The alignment method is based on the X-rays which are generated when high-voltage electrons strike matter. Phase sensitive detection is used to convert the off balance to a linear signal which is then fed back into analog electronics. Results are presented showing a marker pattern automatically aligned to an accuracy of 0.1 µm."
"One of the most promising techniques for large-area submicron electron-beam lithography is the Cathode Projection Microfabrication System. According to published reports, these systems suffer from excessive image distortion. This distortion is partly caused by nonflat photocathodes and silicon wafer anodes. In this paper, a universal curve is obtained which quantitatively predicts and explains the image distortions which result from surface topography. Apparently, the practicality of multilayer submicron lithography in such systems is presently threatened by a requirement that nonreproducible wafer surface waviness be less than 2-3 microns."
"A series of polymers derived from vinylether-maleic anhydride copolymers were prepared and their electron sensitivities measured. One of the most sensitive polymers prepared was the allyl half-ester of an octadecylvinylether maleic anhydride copolymer (VL-100). This material was stable, formed excellent films, and was insensitive to UV and visible light with λ > 2000 Å. The sensitivity to electron irradiation was found to be 4 × 10-8C/cm2at 9 keV compared to 5 × 10-7for KTFR under identical conditions. The evaluation of this material as an electron resist as well as sensitivity data for numerous derivatives is reported."
"This paper reports on the high-yield fabrication of silicon MOS transistors using X-ray lithography, measurements and annealing of fast surface states and oxide charges created by X-ray irradiation, and design considerations for submicrometer linewidth X-ray lithography on 7.5-cm diameter silicon wafers."
"To achieve the high throughput necessary for a practical X-ray lithographic system, we have devised a new overall approach to X-ray lithography based on the use of X-rays with wavelengths of 4-6 Å rather than the 8.34-Å wavelength used in previous work. The principal advantage of the shorter wavelengths is that they allow a system to have X-ray windows so that large area patterns can be replicated under ambient conditions. In addition, the shorter wavelengths simplify the selection of mask substrate materials; thus we have developed a new X-ray mask structure using an optically transparent Mylar substrate. This permits realignment to be done by optical means. We also report results obtained with a new negative resist with high sensitivity to the shorter wavelength X-rays. We have achieved the replication of submicron size features using a 4.6-Å rhodium X-ray source, a Mylar mask with 7000-Å thick gold patterns, and the new resist, and have demonstrated the practicality of this system by the fabrication of propagating magnetic bubble structures with small features."
"An X-ray lithography system is analyzed in terms of maximizing the absorbed energy density in the resist. The individual factors, such as X-ray quantum efficiency, electron-beam energy, wavelength, power dissipated in the anode, and the possible use of an X-ray window are discussed. It is shown that K-line radiation from an Al or Si source is the most efficient for mask membranes of either Si or a thin polymer film without an X-ray window and for a thin Be window. For thick Be windows, L-line radiation sources become more efficient. Fabrication procedures have been developed in our Laboratories for polymer film X-ray masks using both photo and electron-beam lithography. The advantages and disadvantages of such masks are discussed. Etched SiO2patterns made using polymer film masks show excellent replication of the mask patterns."
"This is the first in a series of papers describing a theoretical process model for positive photoresist. This model, based upon a set of measurable parameters, can be used to calculate the response of photoresist to exposure and development in terms of image surface profiles. The model and its parameters are useful in many ways, from measuring quantitative differences between different resist materials to establishment of process sensitivities and optimization of the resist process within a manufacturing system. In this paper, the concepts of photoresist modeling are introduced by following the exposure and development of a photoresist film on silicon exposed by a uniform monochromatic light flux. This very simple example provides insight into the complex nature of the photoresist process for reflective substrates. The accompanying paper, \"Characterization of Positive Photoresists,\" gives detail about measurement of the new photoresist parameters. It is supported by \"In-Situ Measurement of Dielectric Thickness During Etching or Developing Processes\" which discusses automated experimental techniques needed to establish photoresist development rates. These resist parameters provide a complete quantitative specification of the exposure and development properties of the resist. They also allow quantitative comparisons: lot to lot, material to material, and processing condition to processing condition. The fourth paper, \"Modeling Projection Printing of Positive Photoresists,\" applies the process model to one technique of photoresist exposure. This paper contains the detailed mathematics of the model. The model is then used to calculate line-edge profiles For developed resist images."
"This paper presents techniques for measuring a new set of parameters used to describe the image forming properties of positive photoresist [1]. Exposure is described by three optical parameters, A, B, and C, through which the process is modelled. Development is described in terms of a rate relationship R(M) between the rate of removal of photoresist in the developer and the degree of exposure of the photoresist. This set of functional parameters provides a complete description of positive photoresist exposure and development, and is the basis for the theoretical process models discussed in the accompanying papers."
"A system has been developed which permits the measurement of dielectric film thicknesses in-situ during development or etching processes. This can be extended to growth or deposition processes. Two examples of its uses are presented: the determination of the thickness of phosphosilicate glass layers on silicon dioxide coated silicon wafers by making use of the etch rate differences, and the monitoring of photoresist thickness during development to characterize the photoresist development process."
"The accompanying papers \"Optical Lithography\" and \"Characterization of Positive Photoresist\" introduce the concepts of modeling using destruction of the photoactive inhibitor compound to describe exposure and a surface-limited removal rate to describe development together with the optical exposure parameters A, B, and C and a rate relationship, R(M), which characterize the photoresist for modeling purposes. This paper applies the model to, the projection exposure environment: exposure and development of photoresist are treated with a simulation model that allows computation of image surface profiles for positive photoresist exposed with a diffraction limited real image."
"A process is described for reducing the residual effects of standing waves upon exposed and developed lines in positive photoresist films."
"Photoresist thickness nonuniformities in the vicinity of profile steps on substrate surfaces lead to linewidth variations of AZ 1350 photoresist geometries. The effect increases with increasing reflectivity of the substrate, decreasing photoresist layer thickness, and decreasing contrast transfer of the exposure system. It is shown that the photoresist linewidth is maximum when the resist thickness is a multiple of half the exposure wavelength in the resist."
"A simple model for the image formation process in photoresist is proposed based on Fresnel diffraction from the edge of a mask feature. It is shown theoretically and verified experimentally that the dimensional difference between a clear mask feature and its image in photoresist is given by aL½[ ln (Ei) - ln (ET) + ln (K) ] where a and K are constants peculiar to the exposure optics, L is the separation between mask and silicon wafer, Eiis the exposure energy, and ETis the effective exposure energy threshold of the photoresist. The model is used to show the existence of \"optimum\" exposure ratios Ei/ETwhich minimize image variability in hard-, soft-, and near-contact printing. Control of this exposure ratio is found to be the key to successful use of off-contact printing. Based on this model, a photolithographic process control system is outlined in which exposure tool operation and photoresist processing parameters are characterized and monitored with a single silicon wafer. The system is equally applicable to photomask fabrication."
"For a study of the profiles and linewidths of developed photoresist images, photolithographic images in a positive photoresist were obtained by projection printing methods. Also, profiles of the developed images were simulated with an algorithm that computes the optical image intensity distribution appropriate to the projection system, the dynamic exposure response of the resist to the imagery, and the development response of the resist to the developer. Comparisons of experimental profiles and linewidths with simulated ones show good agreement. Thus we deduce that the physics of the model of the overall system contained in the algorithm is a valid description of the system."
"The theoretical model of a surface contour evolution under ion bombardment is applied to the study of the behavior of a mask during ion etching. Two new parameters are defined. The first gives an upper limit of the etching time when distortion-free patterns are needed. The second gives the lateral shift of the pattern if the previous limit is exceeded. Values of mask parameters were measured for various thin metal films under the following conditions: 1) Argon ion energy = 1 keV, 2) ion current density = 0.6 mA/cm2, and 3) oxygen pressure in the sputtering chamber = 10-4torr. It is shown that the introduction of oxygen improves the mask parameters."
"Photolithographic masks used in the fabrication of silicon integrated circuits must be inspected for defects. If the density of defects on a given mask is excessive, the mask is discarded. This paper describes an automated mask inspection system (AMIS) used for inspection of step-and-repeat masks. The limitations of human inspectors are outlined, and the considerations that led to the development of the present system are indicated. Detailed discussions are given of the optical, mechanical, and electronic subsystems, along with a description of the software, including control systems and data processing. AMIS is routinely used to inspect both masters and copies for defects as small as 2 µm, and is capable of measuring individual feature linewidths to less than M 0.1 µm. The long-term stability of AMIS and the absence of human fatigue assure consistently accurate measurement of 1) mask defect density, and 2) the fraction of chip sites which are free of defects of size greater than 2 µm."
"A vacuum frame and a multiple mask alignment system for conformable photomask lithography are described. These instruments greatly improve the convenience and adaptability of conformable photomask lithography and may permit the advantages of improved resolution, dimensional control, photoresist profile control, and reduced mask damage to be realized in routine photolithographic production."

"GaAs IMPATT devices are currently being developed for use as high-power microwave oscillators. Since low thermal impedance is required for dissipation of high input powers, this device is usually fabricated by thermal compression bonding to a diamond heat sink or a multimesa plated heat sink. This paper discusses the development of 4-mesa beam-leaded plated heat sink (BLPHS) C- and X-band GaAs IMPATT diodes. A description of the fabrication procedures is given, whereby the beam-lead interconnects are formed as part of the wafer fabrication procedure. Diodes tested at 5 GHz give up to 7.3 W of output power at 13.5- percent efficiency at a junction temperature of approximately 210°C. X-band diodes, although the data is more limited, show efficiencies up to 16.5 percent (2.2 W) for fiat profile diodes, and up to 20.8 percent for lo-hi-lo profile diodes. BLPHS diodes, therefore, are limited in their efficiency by the epitaxial material's doping profile. Accelerated stress aging data taken to date on BLPHS units show them to have an estimated mean time to failure greater than 2 × 106h at 200°C, which is comparable to thermal compression bonded to diamond units."
"The main computational scheme for the determination of the device-circuit interaction and the internal dynamics of the solid-state device are described. Certain important details are separately discussed in Appendixes. A unique feature in the simulation is the boundary condition at the electrode, characterized here by an energy barrier. Formulated in this way, successful simulations of the Gunn diode, injection-controlled amplifier, IMPATT diode, TRAPATT condition, controlled-avalanche transit-time (CATT) triode, as well as other phenomena reported in the literature, have been demonstrated."
"The paper presents a novel modeling approach to LSI MOST circuits performed at the gate level. A macromodel is analytically derived and provides a direct relationship between the input function and output response of the gate. This approach or macromodeling has been implemented for over 10 000 devices in LSI with only 32K of computer core and very fast computing time. The method employed relates directly the performance parameters (e.g., turn-on voltage, rise, and fall times, etc.) to the device parameters. An insight into the propagation delay of LSI structures is gained by statistically studying the transient performance of the system using Monte-Carlo techniques. Experimental results give ample evidence of good agreement with the computed results, for which various values of x0, oxide thickness, are used."
"During deposition of silicon nitride, the low-current hFEof silicon planar transistors decreases. When the nitride layer completely seals the oxide from the ambient, the initial value of hFEcannot be restored by annealing at 500°C in forming gas. To eliminate this difficulty, hydrogen ions have been implanted at an energy of 70 keV and at doses varying from 1.1013to 1.1016cm-2through the nitride into the oxide. Optimum hFErecovery has been obtained with implantation at a dose of 3.1015cm-2followed by a radiation damage annealing at 400-500°C in dry nitrogen."
"An experimental program was undertaken with the goal of realizing a fast, inexpensive millimeter wave glow discharge video detector. The work performed led to the realization of an economical commercial glow tube that, when biased properly, exhibits a sensitivity quite comparable to that of the crystal diode detector. As a result of this work, an anomalous mode plus a new mode of detection utilizing a sensing electrode external to the glow tube, with considerable improvement in NEP, were observed. In this paper, Part I describes the detection mechanism and physical characteristics of a glow discharge found to be important in the detection of millimeter waves and Part II the results of experiments concerning effects of biasing and gas type and pressure upon sensitivity."
"Experimental efficiencies of up to 35.5 percent have been reported for Read-type GaAs diodes, whereas theoretical calculations have predicted an upper limit of approximately 30 percent for the conversion efficiency of IMPATT diodes. The concept of a premature collection mode is shown to resolve this discrepancy by predicting maximum efficiencies close to 40 percent. Premature collection refers to large-signal conditions where the modulation of the drift width is sufficiently large to result in collection of the avalanche current pulse at drift angles smaller than the small-signal angle. It is shown that a discontinuous transition between the IMPATT and the premature collection modes takes place when the drift angle in the small-signal limit is greater than π. Designing the diode for close to punchthrough conditions in small-signal operation extends the practical frequency range for inducing premature collection by avoiding long drift angles and corresponding rapid conductance saturation in the IMPATT mode. The onset of premature collection is accompanied by a substantial increase in power output because of a more favorable drift angle, and in high noise because of the high RF levels involved. The jump in transit angle causes a discontinuous increase in negative conductance. The hysteresis in the tuning characteristic resulting from this discontinuity has been observed experimentally. Noise measures in the range 60-70 dB have been measured and calculated for the premature collection mode compared to 40-50 dB under large-signal conditions for the IMPATT mode. Therefore, the high efficiencies available with the premature collection mode are expected to be usable only in applications where high noise levels can be tolerated."
"Direct comparison of noise behaviors between GaAs Schottky-barrier junction and Si diffused p+-n junction diodes operating in the 50-GHz range is reported by using the same circuitry. In the oscillator operation, the GaAs diode exhibits excess \"1/fm\" noise near carrier, whereas the Si diode shows flat spectrum. Far from the carrier, and AM-DSB-NSR of -133 dB in a 100-Hz bandwidth and an FM noise measure of 27.1 dB are observed for GaAs diodes. Corresponding values obtained for Si diodes are -125 and 36.2 dB, respectively. As a reflection amplifier, minimum noise figures of 27.5 and 38 dB are achieved for the GaAs and Si devices, respectively. These results indicate that the GaAs IMPATT is superior in noise behavior to the Si diode also in the 50-GHz frequency range by about 10 dB. It is emphasized that the noise induced in the bias circuit of the IMPATT oscillator is a replica of the sideband noise of the output power and can be used as an indicator to obtain a low-noise tuning condition of the oscillator."
"The impurity profile for the second oxidation, used in MOST fabrication, has been obtained by Margalit et al. [1]. The disadvantage of this technique is that the accuracy of their solution is directly dependent on the computer time. In this article, an analytical solution is presented using the approximation of linearizing the second oxidation procedure."
"The capacitive probe used in the past to study the behavior of high-field dipole domains in GaAs is analyzed in detail in order to assess the amount of signal distortion it produces when recording a moving surface potential variation. The results obtained are used to interpret dipole domain measurements in InP. A velocity-field curve for InP between 60 and 160 kV/cm is derived together with information on the variation of the domain shape, domain velocity, peak field, and depletion ratio for different excess domain voltages."
"Charge transfer phenomena in CCD (charge-coupled devices) are analyzed using the newly proposed nonlinear lumped model. In this model, carriers are lumped to the center of the potential well and assumed to be transferred unidirectionally from the lump to the adjacent deep Well. The simple equivalent circuit with a nonlinear driftance, which is defined in this paper, is obtained for one stage transfer. Transfer characteristics are in good agreement with results of numerical analysis. Experimentally observed waveforms of CCD output stage could be explained with this nonlinear lumped model."
"A 2-dimensional diffusion model of rectagular single-and dual-axis, lateral photodiodes is analyzed and the different underlying lateral effects are discussed for the small-signal (unbiased) and fully reverse-biased modes, with either infinite terminating impedances at midlateral point contacts or zero loading impedances at extended lateral contacts. For the single-axis detector with two opposite extended contacts, previous results of the 1-dimensional model appear to remain valid, and the output current difference to sum ratio in the fully reverse-biased mode is a linear function of the position of a narrow incident light beam. For the dual-axis detector with extended contacts at all four sides--except for small gaps at the vertices--an approximately linear relation has been found between the light spot position along an axis and the log ratio of the corresponding output currents. The transient responses of these configurations are discussed, and the utility of operation in the small-signal mode is illustrated with some typical parameter values."
"A modified depletion-layer generation-recombination (g-r) noise theory is given for defects with energy levels away from the middle of the band gap. Measurements are presented on JFET's irradiated with neutrons. The g-r noise spectra of these indicate that five distinct defects are introduced; the results are explained with the modified theory."
"The build-up of thermally generated carriers in a charge-coupled device shift register is characterized by constructing a model for the generation inside a single shift-register bit. Using the model, theoretical response curves are constructed for two practical modes of operation where the contribution from the generation of carriers can be substantial. Experiments are presented which confirm all aspects of the theoretical response curves, including the presence of an initial period of reduced generation in one of the two modes. Procedures for determining generation parameters directly from observed CCD characteristics are presented and implemented. One generation parameter, the minority carrier lifetime τ, is determined by employing the CCD connected in a gate-controlled diode configuration; two others, the depleted surface generation velocity s0, and the general shape of the depletion layer, are determined utilizing a curve fitting procedure. The spatial variation in generation rates is also investigated and found to possess a distribution which is skewed positively and not Gaussian."
"The classical first-approximation high-injection theory in narrow uniform p-n junctions is based on two restrictive assumptions: negligible majority carrier current in the less-doped region (the theory applies to one-sided junctions only) and quasi-neutrality outside the space-charge layer. It has been shown in the literature that, in order to remove both assumptions, numerical integration methods are required. A second-approximation model is proposed in this paper, in which only the first of the two assumptions is removed. This model approaches the accuracy of the exact numerical solution, while still retaining all the advantages of the classical theory, i.e., the availability of analytical solutions and a better physical understanding of the high-injection phenomenon. Furthermore, the proposed model is not restricted to one-sided junctions only."
"We report experiments with single-heterojunction (SH) distributed-feedback (DFB) GaAs diode lasers. Narrow-linewidth (< 0.15 Å), single-mode operation has been observed. Highly collimated beams of 0.6 × 10-2rad divergence radiated perpendicular to the p-n junction have also been produced. These beams are virtually 100 percent polarized with the E-vector parallel to the corrugation grating."
"A new type of GaAs JFET having a heterojunction gate is proposed. The structure involves epitaxially grown layers of n-GaAs for the channel and of p-GaAlAs for the gate which can be easily delineated by the self-alignment technology using an overgrown p-GaAs. The potential advantages of the heterojunction structure for GaAs FET's over the conventional Schottky barrier are in the fewer masks for fabrication and the short channels expected. Some preliminary experimental results on fabrication technologies and dc characteristics of the new devices are described."
"Measurements are presented of noise in JFET's at low temperatures (80-200 K) for devices having a low pinch-off voltage. The noise spectra show the presence of several types of generation-recombination g-r processes. Two processes are attributed to traps in the channel. Further, at the lowest temperatures a long plateau, associated with donor transitions, is observed."
"A new derivation is given for the noise in JFET's stemming from generation-recombination or trapping processes in the channel. For the case of a delta function carrier covariance, the result is the same as that of van der Ziel. However, the present derivation is more direct and can be easily extended to more general cases."
"The possibility of triggering avalanche transistors by optical signals and the resulting electrical characteristics are presented. These avalanche phototransistor (APT) detectors are capable of generating nanosecond output pulses at high current levels. A series connection of an APT and injection laser is shown to operate as a simple PCM-regenerator circuit in optical communication systems."
"The effect of ionizing radiation on n-channel MOSFET's with channel lengths ranging from 1.0 to 9.3 µm and gate oxides 200 Å thick was investigated. Irradiation to 106rads(Si) resulted in an increased shift of the threshold voltage as the channel length was shortened with those devices having channel lengths 2 µm continuing to operate in the enhancement mode."

 "Voltage-selection waveforms of the conventional type, 2:1 or 3:1, are used in the vast majority of refreshed, matrix-addressed displays. This paper questions this rationale and shows the derivation of alternative selection waveforms matched to the display device electrooptical characteristic. The derivation is based on the concept that the time-averaged luminance values of selected and unselected elements is more important than their instantaneous values, we find that the amplitude of the strobe and data signals can be chosen to produce either a larger number of scanned lines than is possible with 2:1 or 3:1 selection, or to reduce the drive power for a display of specified size and contrast."
"DC storage panels that pass a steady current during the display period after information has been entered normally require a resistor in series with each cell. If graphite is used as the cathode material, however, these resistors can be eliminated. The construction and characteristics of an experimental 128-character panel, designed to test the feasibility of operating many cells in parallel without limiting resistors, is described."
"An experimental color-TV picture display is presented on a dc gas-discharge panel which is based on the Burroughs' \"self-scan\" panel. An array of 127 × 160 dots of three color phosphors were formed on the inner surface of the front glass plate to reproduce color pictures. A thinner center sheet of soda glass with a thickness of 0.25 mm was used so that the phosphors might be excited effectively by the UV radiation generated from the negative glow of the discharge. Based on our vacuum-spectroscopic measurements on various phosphors, Y2SiO5:Ce (blue), Zn2SiO4:Mn (green), and Y2O3:Eu (red) were selected. An excellent color picture was reproduced with a contrast ratio of greater than 30:1 with continuous gray scale."
"A flat 8-in diagonal gas-discharge color-TV has been fabricated and operated at 5 fL in white with a luminous efficiency of 0.05 lm/W. The contrast ratio was measured at better than 300:1, owing to the special configuration of the discharge cell, and also the careful adjustment of gas loading conditions. The CIE chromaticity coordinates for red, green, and blue (R,G,B) exhibited in the panel were, respectively, (0.56,0.31), (0.22,0.68), and (0,17,0.14)-- reasonably good values considering those of NTSC. The electrical and optical properties of the panel as well as the techniques for real-time TV picture display are discussed."
"Enhanced drive schemes to increase the flexibility of parallel self-shift plasma display/memory panels are presented. The panel is divided electrically into strips that can be shifted independently. Writing is done with pulsewidth modulation, requiring simple circuitry and no extra power supply. The performance of these extensions is evaluated, and possible system configurations are discussed."
"Two addressing techniques which utilize the discharge-logic principle are described. Basic operating principles are discussed along with specific waveforms and drive circuitry for the two methods. Operating characteristics are also considered."
"A plasma display panel with auxiliary discharge cells to control the display cells has been developed. The panel can be directly controlled by low-voltage MOS-LSI switching circuits."
"Keep-alive border cells are used to prime addressed cells of a plasma panel to improve the write margin. Currently, the time relationship between the drive waveform for the keep-alive border and the write waveform is kept fixed or static. The effectiveness of the static keep-alive arrangement is very limited: e.g., an experiment is described showing that across a 2.4-in span (between keep-alive border and address cell), this breakdown voltage increases by 14 percent and the ionization time almost doubles. These spatial variations greatly reduce the operating margins. A dynamic keep-alive scheme has been designed to provide spatial uniformity of breakdown voltage and ionization time, and thus to improve the write margins. It can be implemented by simply using the most-significant bits of an address to control the firing of a single keep-alive driver. Experimental results show that for a 5 × 5-in panel, the dynamic keep-alive scheme provides about 50-percent improvement in write margin over the static keep-alive arrangement. Some of this write margin can be traded to provide increased sustain margins."
"The results of recent luminous efficiency measurements on Digivue® display/memory panels are presented. It is found that luminous efficiency increases with decreasing minority gas concentration and increases with increasing dielectric thickness. Spectroscopic measurements are reported on the emission spectra from various Xe-based gas mixtures. Luminous efficiencies reported here take into account all the light emitted into 4π sterads. A maximum luminous efficiency of 1.8 lm/W was obtained using a panel containing P-1 phosphor and a xenon-argon mixture."
"Excellent life performance is being achieved for ac plasma display panels through understanding of the causes of voltage changes, surface overcoat material research, and adjustment of the manufacturing process to eliminate contaminants. It has been found that surface aging phenomena are dominant in many practical cases. Because of prefereutial operation patterns (i.e., alpha numerics), a differential aging pattern may evolve. The differential pattern is the result of voltage changes which are different for heavily operated and lightly or nonoperated cells. It is shown that the nature and extent of surface changes are dependent on overcoat material selection and the presence (or absence) of contaminants introduced during manufacture. With the use of thin overcoat layers in contact with the gas, it is necessary to be aware of the possibility of surface film removal by sputtering. The effects of significant variables: gas pressure and composition surface material, and operating voltage are discussed."
"The state of the art, including advances reported at the Specialist Conference on the technology of visible electroluminescent diodes, is reviewed."
"An ac or dc GaP LED array has been designed and fabricated which has potential as a direct replacement for several tungsten filament lamps and as an illuminator for new design considerations. In designing such an LED for high-voltage application, series light emitting junctions rather than series resistors are used as a voltage divider to maximize the light output/power input ratio. A figure of merit is modeled and calculated which provides a measure of total light output for a given applied current and voltage as a function of the number of series diodes. The optimum number of series diode for a given ac voltage is Vrms/1.94. Thermal calculations based upon chip size, power dissipation, and thermal contact resistance predict a peak temperature rise of 30°C for the bonded die approach. n- and p-type liquid phase epitaxial layers were grown on semi-insulating substrates, p-n junctions on the same chip were electrically isolated utilizing either proton bombardment or chemically etched trenches. An Au metallization scheme provides the series-parallel interconnection required for ac or dc operation while maintaining junction isolation. The light emitting junction areas are mesas, with edges shaped to redirect internally generated light out to the viewer. The near field radiation pattern demonstrates the optical effectiveness of the shaped-mesa emitters."
"A complete material characterization of electroluminescent diodes necessarily requires a high spatial resolution because of the micron-sized thickness of the different epitaxial layers. A modified arrangement of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) has proven to be an extremely useful tool for obtaining information on the various parameters of each of these layers. It will be shown that the analysis of the electron beam induced voltages (EBIV) and currents (EBIC) allows not only the location of the junction itself, but also the detection of all other built-in barriers. Measurements of the EBIC permit separation of barriers less than 1 µm apart; even barriers in a direction oposite to that of the junction are detected in this manner. The peak value of EBIC is largely independent of the barrier height, but it is sensitive to variations in the concentration of the components of the lattice. Because of the exponential decrease of EBIC with the distance between primary electron beam and barrier, the minority carrier diffusion length can be obtained for all different barriers. The height of barriers, 2.5 µm separated and with the same direction as the p-n junction, can be determined quantitatively by the maximum of EBIV. By measurement of the cathodoluminescence (CL) signal regions of different recombination probabilities for radiative transitions (and therefore different luminescence yields) can be distinguished. Thus inhomogeneities of the structure can be detected. By spectral CL analysis the spatial variation of the width of the bandgap will be shown."
"As a means of promoting radiative recombination in GaAs1-xPx, nitrogen doping by ion implantation has been evaluated. When the sample is impanted at room temperature, poor results are obtained. However, when the sample is heated up to 350°C during implantation, and annealed at 800°C for 1 h, photoluminescence spectra are obtained similar to those of GaAs1-xPxwith N incorporated during growth. For indirect-bandgap GaAs1-xPx(x = 0.52), the integrated intensity at 77 K of the implanted sample is more than 1000 times larger than that of an unimplanted sample. This shows that under appropriate conditions implanted N atoms are substituted for P atoms and become isoelectronic traps. This trap, under the proper annealing conditions, can enhance radiative recombination significantly."
"A series of experiments have been done in which the properties of GaP grown by liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) have been varied by providing an additional source of phosphorus via the vapor phase. The quality of the crystals, as judged from gross defect features observed in etched cross sections, is a function of the amount of phosphorus added to the vapor phase."
"Blue electroluminescence has been obtained in GaN with the energy supplied to each electron lower than the energy of the emitted photons. This antistokes emission increased with the cube of the current. An external power efficiency of 3 × 10-4was obtained. A tentative model of impact excitation by two hot electrons is proposed as the excitation mechanism. The prospects of practical applications of this phenomenon are discussed."
"A numeric liquid-crystal display using the dynamic scattering mode has been developed for calculators by adopting a total system design through the integrated development of material, device, and system. A mixed Schiff-base nematic liquid crystal with the dopants of l-hexadecylpyridinum bromide and p-aminophenol has been developed for the 1:2 selection multiplexing drive over a wide temperature range (0-40°C). A reliable package has been achieved with new technology. A 1-chip CMOS driving circuit with a 42-lead package has been developed for 8-digit 7-segment numeric readout displays in order to eliminate the dc component of the applied voltage, to minimize variations in the drive voltage, and to reduce power consumption. The devices have passed severe reliability tests. Our displays have lasted 15 000 h under normal test conditions. Using the dichroic mirror approach, it has become possible to design color displays of yellow, green, blue, or any color which have high readability and wide viewing angle under severe ambient light conditions."
"In nematic liquid-crystal layers with a π/2 twist, reverse twist disclination lines occur which can be pinned by surface features and moved by electric fields. We consider these effects as the basis of a bistable matrix display. The optical transmission through twisted regions of opposite chirality is analyzed using a Poincaré sphere construction."
"A thin-film-transistor (TFT) switching array suitable as a module for matrix addressing of a wide variety of display media in flat-panel form has been designed and fabricated. The switching matrix and the display medium are on separate substrates. Solder bumps or other suitable contacts are used to connect each switch to the corresponding resolution element of the display. The matrix is a 20-line-per-inch 32 × 32-element array on a 1.6-in-square active area. A 5 × 7-dot character matrix is employed, and a single module will produce four lines of five characters each. The application of this array to an electroluminescent (EL) film display is described."
"Over the last two years, we have been working on a solution of the solid-state display addressing problem which consists of building the addressing circuits (and eventually, also scanning or decoding circuits) directly on the panel, and fully integrated with the particular display medium. The technique utilized for this approach is that of a vacuum-deposited thin-film transistor matrix. In this paper, we report on the design, construction, and performance of a 12 000 element EL panel, suitable for alphanumeric, vectorgraphic, and monochrome TV image presentation. The basic circuit, repeated at every picture element, consists of an X-Y-addressed logic transistor, a power transistor, and a storage capacitor. The entire circuit was fabricated through multiple evaporations in a multisource system using one pumpdown cycle. The finished thin-film circuit is covered with a sprayed EL-phosphor. An evaporated Au/PbO layer forms the continuous top electrode. The entire display panel is finally sealed with a glass cover plate. Reproducible fabrication of good-quality displays was achieved, with >99 percent of the elements operational. Excellent alphanumeric displays with very few defects were demonstrated. Contrast ratios >50:1 (ON:OFF under dark ambient) were obtained. Power consumption under typical alphanumeric display conditions was below 1 W, with a peak brightness of 40 fL."
"Several different types of electrochromic display devices are discussed. Their electrooptical properties and device characteristics are investigated and compared. Performance parameters for these devices are discussed in terms of their applicability to information display. It is concluded that electrochromism is best suited for direct-addressed displays."
"A new type of flat-panel ambient-illuminated display is described. Images in this display are formed by magnetically controlling the orientations of small spherical multicolored magnetic particles. A demonstration model is shown and the possibility for application to television is studied. It is estimated that for a 9 × 12-cm black-and-white screen with built-in magnetic memory and 500 × 500 sequential matrix addressing the display panel can be driven at TV rates with an average current of 0.27 A and dissipation of 0.26 W. Contrast ratios up to 40:1 seem achievable with continuously variable grays. The display also features a nonvolatile memory which can be very desirable for some applications. Methods for fabricating this display are also discussed."
"A completely sealed-off electron beam-addressed light valve offering high reliability, low thermal impedance, and low-voltage operation is described. It is suitable for projection displays and is capable of producing bright high-contrast images with full gray-scale range and long-term storage. The light valve is contained as the faceplate in an otherwise standard, sealed-off 1½-in diameter vidicon tube and utilizes conventional focusing and deflection components. The target, which is fabricated of refractory materials using high-yield semiconductor-processing techniques, is composed of a dense matrix (500 elements/in) of aluminized silicon-dioxide membranes (~ 3000-Å thickness) which are supported centrally on small silicon posts (4-5 µm high) above a transparent sapphire faceplate. These flat, stress-free oxide membranes can be deflected electrostatically (up to 4°) when addressed with the electron beam. Thus an intensity-modulated display of the deposited charge pattern on the \"mirror matrix\" is produced when this type of light valve is used in conjunction with reflective schlieren optical arrangement, Mechanical and optical considerations have led to a special 4-leaf geometry of the mirror elements, enabling operation at low-voltage levels (175 V) and a high optical gating efficiency (~ 50 percent) to be achieved. Large-screen (2½-by 3½-ft) displays with up to 35-fL highlight brightness ( ×5 screen gain), 15:1 contrast ratio, and 400 TV lines resolution have been demonstrated. In addition, single-frame displays (1/30-s writetime) with full gray scale storage (of many hours) have been achieved. Preliminary studies using higher density mirror matrices (1000 elements/in) show that the display resolution can be extended to 600 TV lines/picture height."
"Aphotoactivated liquid-crystal projection display device that is based upon the field-effect mode of the liquid crystal has been built and tested. The device displays high-resolution dynamic color symbology by means of the optical birefringence of the liquid crystal. The colors that can be displayed simultaneously are white (with gray scale), blue, green, yellow, and magenta on a dark field. The imaging light power required to excite the device varies from 30-900 µW/cm2at 525 nm and the resolution obtained at an MTF of 50 percent is 40 lines/mm. The basic construction of the device is similar to the dynamic scattering photoactivated liquid-crystal light valve."
"A new method of projection-type composite holography for displaying three-dimensional (3-D) color information has been developed. The basic concept and the results of the experiments are described. A model 3-D color display system for storing several kinds of colored cinematic information is presented as a practical application of the method. This method constructs the 3-D color image by synthesizing the reconstructed images which are projected on the unilaterally direction-selective screen from several holograms. The 3-D color information is recorded as 3N holograms on a roll film arranged in an arc, the center of which is located on the screen. To reconstruct the 3-D color information three kinds of laser beams (red, green, and blue) illuminate these 3N holograms under the same condition. All the reconstructed images from these 3N holograms are projected and synthesized on the unilaterally direction-selective screen. The direction-selective axis of the screen is set parallel to the direction of the film. Consequently the color components of the reconstructed images are diffusely reflected and the angular components are reflected back in the original direction. The human eye can recognize a 3-D color image in the viewing zone enlarged through the vertical diffusing effect of the screen."
"Cathodochromic materials have the property that they change color upon excitation by an electron beam. While a portion of the coloration may be erased optically the remaining coloration can be removecl only by heating the material. Cathode ray tubes (CRT's) employing these materials as image screens offer long image storage, high resolution, high contrast, and gray scale. The construction of these devices is determined by the erase technique employed. Most previous device designs have the image screen deposited on a thin substrate which is suspended within the CRT envelope. Erasure is accomplished by raising the temperature of the target structure by either resistive, radiative, or electron-beam heating. A new cathodochromic cathode ray tube has been developed which employs a single electron gun for both writing and completely erasing a faceplate-deposited bromine-sodalite image screen. The device construction and erase technique are discussed. This device offers rugged and inexpensive construction, selective erase, and a \"black-on-white\" display."
"A simple, reliable, and accurate method of obtaining modulation transfer function (MTF) data from cathode ray tubes (CRT's) has been developed. This method directly generates a tube's MTF independent of drive electronics by electrically, optically, and mechanically obtaining the modulus of the Fourier transform of the CRT's line-spread function. Data have been obtained from commercially available and recently developed prototype miniature CRT's. These tubes have nominal faceplate diameters of one inch and are encapsulated assemblies containing CRT, deflection yoke, and shield. Military applications include helmet-mounted displays and tank-commander and gunner sights requiring the display of high-quality thermal and low-light-level TV imagery. The most widely used miniature CRT exhibits a severe degradation in MTF when the brightness (screen current) is increased. A reduction of this degradation has been demonstrated for a recently developed prototype employing a laminar-flow electron gun. At 20 C/mm and 10 µA of screen current, the MTF values for these two types were 20 and 44 percent, respectively. Off-axis measurements reveal that some CRT's with lower center MTF than these two types have higher off-axis responses. Such performance can be attributed to better deflection-yoke selection and electron-optic design, which optimize performance over an area rather than at the center of the faceplate."
"A light-pen detection System for a plasma panel, with the supporting panel-drive system, is described, The system disturbs the time of light emission of the cell, making it detectable. The disturb pulse is similar to one previously reported, but does offer an advantage because it does not affect the panel sustain margin."
"Double heterostructure light emitting diodes of GaAs- (Ga, Al)As have been developed for use as high radiance sources. The light is collected through a small window parallel to the emitting junction plane using a selective diffusion method for local contact. The external power efficiency is about 1 percent and the rise and fall time of the diodes is about 10 ns. Relatively constant optical output at current densities of 1800 A/cm2have so far been obtained for several thousand hours."
"Matrix driving of a liquid-crystal transmissive display panel in a dynamic deformation mode is described. In this mode, a very thin homeotropic layer of negative dielectric anisotropy liquid crystal is placed between crossed polarizers. In addition, suitable selection electric-field pulses and modulation waveforms are applied to the liquid crystal in such a way that the alignment is deformed by and let relax between the pulses at a rate high enough to avoid flickering. A 24-digit display making use of a liquid-crystal layer of 3 µm ±10- percent thickness was built and operated in multiplex mode using a single 7-segrnent decoder and 24 digit-selection drivers. Quickly changing images together with good viewing angle, contrast, and efficiency have been obtained."
"A shortening of the response time of a field-effect device in which liquid Crystals with a positive dielectric anisotropy were used and operated in the tunable birefringence mode has been achieved. This technique has been applied to a 40 × 40 matrix display operated in a 3:1 selection scheme; a real time display with buildup and decay lags of 5 and 20 ms, respectively, and with contrast ratios of 5:1-30:1 has been realized."
"A liquid crystal becomes opaque at a higher temperature and transparent at a lower temperature by simultaneous application of heat and an audio-frequency voltage. By this contrast, a termally addressed display is demonstrated for dynamic figures."

"Expressions are obtained for the noise figure of the photoelectric image intensifier type of tube using a microchannel plate in the linear gain mode, including effects of dark current and ionic or optical feedback in the MCP, and of the same device using the MCP in an electron-counting mode. Comparison shows that the latter should be a preferable mode of operation, if practical problems can be overcome."
"High-speed microwave modulation is obtained by exploiting the intervalley electron transfer time in certain ternary III-V compounds. Saturation of the net carrier drift velocity due to intervalley electron transfer at threshold fields below 3 kV/cm is reported in GaA1-xPxand AlxGa1-xAs for x = 0.315 ± 0.01 and 0.38 ± 0.02, respectively. The equivalent circuit of a bulk device fabricated from such material is derived and verified through small-signal RF measurements which, in addition, directly yield the high-field differential mobility and electron diffusion coefficient of the material. Operated as a microwave switch, isolation levels in excess of 20 dB with 4-dB insertion loss are reported at X-band with GaAS1-xPxdevices. It is shown that contact resistance can present serious limitations, although refinements in contacting technology should result in improved performance, making devices useable through millimeter-wave frequencies. Switching speed, the measurement of which is limited by laboratory pulse generation and detection capabilities, is estimated to be well under 200 ps and a theoretical limit of 20 ps has been predicted. The importance of this work lies in the fact that these switching speeds can be obtained with no sacrifice of incident RF power-handling capability, since there is no minority-carrier charge storage in these majority-carrier devices. In addition, the devices are stable at their transit-time frequency due to the absence of negative differential mobility in the material."
"A one-dimensional small-signal noise model of p+nvp+and metal (M) nvp+BARITT diodes has been developed. Included in the model is a detailed description of the physical mechanisms which are present near the injecting contact of either type of diode. The equations resulting from the model have been solved to give the small-signal diode noise measure and admittance as functions of diode parameters and operating conditions. A comparison of the noise performance of p+nvp+diodes with that of metal nvp+diodes, shows that the latter possess inherently larger noise measures. A detailed examination of p+nvp+diode small-signal noise measures above X-band frequencies, shows that minimum noise measures of order 10 dB can be maintained up to at least 20 GHz."
"A simple computer model of the dc electrical-thermal behavior of a Schottky-barrier GaAs IMPATT diode has been modified to include the effects of temperature-dependent thermal resistance. This has made possible the computation of dc V-I characteristics for various IMPATT diode designs and parameters. Computed terminal V-I characteristics, as well as E-J characteristics for points within the depletion layer invariably have shown successive regions of increasing, then decreasing, positive differential resistance, culminating in a region of negative differential resistance. According to an analysis of differential negative resistance appearing in the literature [5], it is a natural consequence of operation in a negative resistance region for high-current filaments to form. Furthermore, a phenomenological argument is cited to justify high-current filamentation in a region of decreasing positive resistance. Experimental evidence is advanced to support the contention that IMPATT shortouts are the natural consequence of diode operation beyond a differential resistance maximum, where the resistance, although positive, is decreasing and the formation of destructive high-current filaments is inevitable."
"Theory and experimental results using COS/MOS devices are presented for using ion-implanted surface guard layers to replace guard bands in LSI COS/MOS circuits. The function of a guardband is to reduce leakage between neighboring devices; surface guard layers accomplish the same end with the addition of a considerable reduction in the space required for a given COS/MOS memory cell. The price paid for the elimination of the guardbands is a tradeoff between the onset of leakage and the onset of avalanche breakdown between drain and substrate. A systematic method is presented for optimizing these two limiting voltages for a given value of field oxide thickness and for defined limits of the Qsoxide charge."
"For the detection of either stationary or moving objects in a LLLTV (low light level TV) environment with a charge coupled device (CCD), two techniques have been demonstrated which will result in improved detection. These are 1) use of an EBS (electron bombarded silicon) or EBIC Mode CCD which provides gain by accelerating photogenerated electrons and 2) use of a motion compensation mode where charge packets are shifted in unison with a (constant velocity) target."
"Adapted formulas describing the current-voltage relationship of MOS transistors with nonuniform substrate doping are presented. Only the case Where, at zero background polarization, the depletion layer is larger than the implanted impurity depth, is considered. Attention is given to the experimental determination of the effective mobility, the space-charge-layer depth and, if the impurity profile is inown, of the surface potential, the flatband voltage, and the maximum allowable dose for low bulk effect. Experiments are in good agreement with the calculations. Deviations between theory and experiment for small gate voltages are observed in the intermediate region between weak and strong inversion."
"Starting from Pierce's small-signal TWT equations, a two-wave theory for complicated TWT's and BWO's is developed. Explicit gain expressions for TWT's with severs and velocity tapers are given. A detailed treatment is given of a BWA structure with a single-step velocity taper in the center. The BWO start oscillation current is calculated as a function of the taper strength. The effciency of a step velocity taper as a remedy for backward-wave oscillations in the higher passbands of a TWT is then analyzed. It is shown that a suitable taper can increase the start oscillation current by more than a factor of 10 without adverse effects on the TWT performance if the backward waye coupling impedance is low. A tube with a weak linear taper is analyzed by a perturbation technique and it is found that there is no significant difference between the start oscillation currents for tubes with weak linear or abrupt tapers of comparable strengths."
"A method of calculation of coupled-cavity TWT performance which is programmable for fast and economical calculation on a time-sharing computer is presented. The tube is modeled as a sequence of interaction gaps and tunnels, with cavities associated with each gap. The fields are expanded in terms of a sequence of stationary waves anchored on each gap, instead of a set of traveling waves. Space-charge forces are calculated by a fast potential-gradient method instead of from a Green's function. These methods allow flexibility in the model as well as speed. The method is applied to three simple examples, to show the behavior of components of a TWT, and then to two actual designs."
"The nonlinear phase distortion in traveling-wave tubes is calculated in order to obtain its dependence on design and working parameters by using a large-signal theory. The relation between the nonlinear phase distortion and the output power due to the reduction of the average electron velocity is also studied. AM-PM conversion coefficients are directly measured along a tube with no local attenuator and found to be in fairly good agreement with the theoretical values. A vector diagram representation and equations of simple form are developed, and their adaptability for the physical description of the nonlinear phase distortion are demonstrated."
"The benefits inherent in the tetrode structure and the potential of GaAs are combined to realized a dual-gate FET with low noise and a wide dynamic range at microwave frequencies. A design theory of the dual-gate FET is constructed on the basis of the Lehovec-Zuleeg model for single-gate FET's. The theory has led to a new device structure having a second gate with a deeper pinchoff voltage than the first which shows improved gain and noise performance. Also derived is the importance of minimizing parasitic feedthrough due, for example, to packages. Samples were fabricated using n-type epitaxial GaAs. The first and second gates were Schottky barriers, 1.2 and 2.5 µm long. The improved channel structure was accomplished by reducing the thickness of the epitaxial layer under the first gate. Samples were mounted and characterized in specially designed small-size ceramic packages with a feedthrough capacitance of only 0.004 pF. The possibility of gain control by means of second gate bias over a wide bandwidth is demonstrated."
"The IRicon is an IR-sensitive photoconductive TV camera tube. Recently declassified, it was developed for the military to whom many tubes were supplied in direct-readout or return-beam form with magnetic or electrostatic focus and deflection. Passive imaging of low-temperature objects such as humans or vehicles was observed with a normal TV speed of response. Resolution varied from about 100 TV lines at very low radiation levels to about 500 at higher levels. Scene temperatures denoting less than 1° C from ambient have been detected using f/1.2 optics."
"Avalanche multiplication calculations are performed in high-voltage planar p-n junctions to determine breakdown voltage limitations imposed by curvature effects. The issue of choice of ionization coefficient for avalanche multiplication is discussed. From the calculations, a series of design curves and equations are generated which relate the breakdown voltage and peak electric field to those of an ideal junction of the same doping profile, the critical parameters being the substrate doping concentration, the diffusion profile, and the ratio of the radius of curvature to the substrate depletion width for the ideal one-dimensional case. With appropriate distance normalization, these curves and equations can be reduced to a single curve and a single equation. The agreement between theory and experiment is consistently good provided the correct ionization coefficients are used in the theory."
"The operation of a new type of infrared photon detector is described. This device is a gold-doped n-channel MOSFET that employs impurity photoionization to modulate its drain-to-source conductance. A simple mathematical model is developed whereby the infrared-sensing MOSFET (IRFET) can be analyzed, and experimental results that verify the model are provided. The near-infrared, i.e., wavelengths from 1.38 to 3.54 µm, response of gold impurity centers in the space-charge region behind the strong surface inversion layer of a MOSFET is shown to correspond to the characteristics observed previously by other authors for the gold centers in bulk silicon. A static read-only memory capability and high responsivity, typically 4 mW/µJ, are the most significant IRFET characteristics. Applications in large-scale-integrated imaging arrays are anticipated."
"A new method for the evaluation of steady-state space-charge distributions in electron-beam devices is presented, for use in numerical-analysis computer programs. Its features include simplicity of implementation and improved accuracy. These characteristics are illustrated by various electron-flow systems. The difficulty of convergence to the steady-state solution for systems incorporating strong magnetic fields is demonstrated and a method of overcoming it is suggested."
"A double-ended scan converter tube has recently been developed which uses a silicon diode array for the storage target. The purpose of the device is to capture high-speed single transients or low-repetition-rate signals and to retain the information until it can be read out at speeds slow enough for handling by conventional processing and display circuits. Improvements in wide-bandwidth deflection and the resolution of both writing and reading guns, combined with a charge gain of 2000 in the target, enables data to be stored at unprecedented rates. Information writing speeds of 2 × 1012tracewidths/s are possible with the device, sufficient for displaying a full-screen 2-GHz Sine wave. To reliably digitize the readout for signal processing, a signal-to-noise ratio of about 20:1 is required which the device, will provide at speeds up to 5 × 1011tracewidths/s. Resolution at a 50-percent modulation level is 400 TV lines per horizontal scan (15.7 cycles/mm at the target)."
"A MOS digital capacitor capable of operation at VHF and UHF frequencies is described. This new device is made up of a parallel combination of MOS capacitors each of which can be individually switched between two distinct capacitance values; a maximum binary state being the high-frequency MOS inversion capacity and the minimum being that of a deep-depletion MOS device, Switching is accomplished by on chip MOSFET's. Isolation of the RF terminals is accomplished by the high intervening channel impedances of the switching MOS gates. The basic structure and the principles of operation will be discussed, and operational performance figures for RF tuning range, linearity, dynamic range, and figure of merit Q will be presented."
"It is shown that metal-insulatior-semiconductor (MIS) and Schottky-barrier microstrip structures having substrate resistivities within a certain range propagate slow waves with phase velocities that are dependent upon the instantaneous voltage at each point along the line. This and other useful properties of these microstrips can be used advantageously in a number of microwave devices. Loss measurements for the MIS microstrip structure confirm the predictred frequency dependence of the attenuation constant. While the levels of measured attenuation presently achieved are fairly high (4.5 dB/cm at 1 GHz), several methods for reducing the attenuation are proposed. A number of devices are discussed, including an electronically variable phase shifter for which attenuation and phase-shift measurements are presented."
"Some new methods to define design rules for integrated-circuits by evaluating a large quantity of results measured from test structures are described. To define the minimum area of a contact hole, more detailed methods are discussed than simple yield analysis: for example, the analysis of the resistances measured or of the local distribution of defects. Using a special test structure of misaligned contact holes, important data for the design rules, such as the alignment tolerance and the mask tolerance, can be defined experimentally."
"The efficiency of the yield of second harmonics in nonpolar nondegenerate semiconductors is estimated using an improved hyperbolic relation to describe the nonlinear velocity-electric-field relation from the ohmic region up to the saturation region at room temperature. For n-Ge and n-Si, an efficiency of about 4 percent is obtained for the optimum dc bias field, about V0/µ0(i.e. the ratio of the saturation velocity to the low-field mobility)."
"A p-channel MOS transistor in InSb single crystal, operating at 77 K, is described. The source and drain are defined by etching a mesa structure in a cadmium diffused p layer into a tellurium-doped InSb substrate. The gate is formed by evaporation of chromium gold on top of a layer of SiO2, deposited at 215°C. The MOS transistor is characterized by a threshold voltage of -3 V and an effective hole mobility of 330 cm2. V-1.s-1."
 "Popcorn (burst) noise continues to deteriorate the operation of linear IC devices. Reduction of popcorn noise by a few simple modifications in the manufacturing process is reported in this paper. Annealing in an HC1 atmosphere to getter metal impurities and slow pulling after emitter deposition to diminish stress-induced junction defects appear to reduce the popcorn noise significantly."
"Mueller's mechanism for obtaining enhanced shot noise in p-n diodes due to thermal feedback is evaluated for a small diode represented by a lumped circuit thermal model. The excess noise is negligible at low-power dissipation but very significant if the device can operate near thermal instability. For devices represented by a distributed thermal circuit, the device can show excess noise with a spectrum 1/fαwhere α is close to unity, over a limited frequency range."
"Switching properties of Nb-Nb2O5-Nb devices with doped Nb2O5amorphous films were studied as a function of applied voltage and temperature. A continuous recording of the switching process made possible the determination of switching parameters as a function of small voltage increments. Using this technique, it is found that switching occurs within 2.5 mV with a delay time > 1 ms. A switching device of this type can support an input power of ∼1 W."

"Previous calculations of noise in bucket-brigade devices (BBD's) have ignored subthreshold leakage current even though BBD's operate in the subthreshold region over most of their useful frequency range. In this work, subthreshold leakage is included in the calculation, but surprisingly, it makes little difference in the end result. The noise spectrum in p-channel BBD's is measured and agrees well with the calculated noise spectrum which includes the effects of correlation between noise packets, imperfect charge transfer efficiency, and output circuitry."
"A new five-parameter model for the behavior of field-effect transistors with high drain voltage has been developed. The resulting single expression is shown to predict the drain-current-gate-voltage characteristics of a variety of devices with an accuracy of ±0.002 V over many decades of drain current. Several methods for the evaluation of model parameters are discussed. The effect of temperature is successfully included in the model in one case. Cross-modulation characteristics can be calculated which are in qualitative agreement with measurements."
"Analytical equations are presented that rigorously establish the electrostatic potential and electric field at the metallurgical transition point of an abrupt p-n semiconductor junction. From these equations, the classical depletion-layer approximation is shown to be rigorously correct only when (NA= ND), although this solution remains adequate for engineering purposes if 1.0 ≤ NA/ ND≤ 10.0, approximately. It is also shown that mechanisms of operation take place within an asymmetrical abrupt junction (NA≥ ND) that cannot be deduced from the depletion-layer aproximation. For example, the asymmetrical junction is shown to contain an electrostatic potential and an electric field at its metallurgical transition point that are essentially constant throughout a wide range of reverse biasing voltage. These characteristics imply that the total electrostatic charge within its p-type and n-type space charge layers remain essentially constant, and that its p-type space-charge layer is of constant width, despite the application of a reverse biasing voltage. These heretofore unreported mechanisms of operation arise from a layer of mobile charge carriers residing at the low-doped side of the metallurgical transition between n-type and p-type semiconductor material."
"A dc model is-presented for the ion-implemented silicon-gate depletion-mode IGFET from which the device terminal behavior can be determined. The device equations are derived based on the concept of a finite semiconductor capacitance in the channel region whereby the depth of the implanted channel is taken into account. The model parameter is shown to be easily measurable experimentally. The validity of the resulting model is demonstrated by showing good agreement between calculated and measured results obtained from fabricated devices, It is believed that this model lends itself well to the circuit design problem using depletion mode IGFET's."
"A novel voltage tuneable spectrometer-detector has been demonstrated whose principles are associated with the electric subbands existent at the interface between silicon and silicon dioxide. The photoresistive response of n-channel MOSFET structures to radiation resonant with energy levels in the inversion layer has been characterized and compared with existent theory. Operating at 4.2 K, typical devices have continuous tuneability from 8 MeV (∼150 µm) to 30 MeV (∼40 µm), a bandwidth of approximately 1 MeV, a response time of 2.5 × 10-4s, and a noise equivalent power (NEP) of approximately 2.5 × 10-10W/(Hz)1/2limited by the available amplifiers."
"The development of high-energy electric-discharge lasers has created the requirement for high-voltage large-area uniform-current-density electron beams. This paper describes the characteristics for a class of filamentary electron guns of novel electrode configuration that satisfies these requirements. Expressions are derived for the gun potentials, electric fields, and space-charge-limited current densities. A comparison is made between theoretical and experimental results for a low-voltage model gun. The operating characteristics for large-area high-voltage guns are also discussed."
"The specific current-voltage characteristics of epitaxial silicon films on insulator (ESFI®) SOS MOS transistors are shown, discussed in comparison to bulk silicon MOST's, and explained by the differences in geometrical considerations, charge distribution, and operation mode, The ESFI MOST's are produced on silicon islands, in most applications, the electrical substrate is at floating potential. This results in two effects. At first a threshold voltage change occurs with increasing drain voltage, producing a kink in the current curve; if the drain voltage further increases, a parasitic bipolar transistor begins to work and effects another kink or bend in the curve. On the other hand, the finite vo|ume effects a strong dependence of the base width of the parasitic bipolar transistor on the drain voltage and causes a rise of the current amplification with the drain voltage. The finite volume below the gate oxide also limits the bulk-charge magnitudes with subsequent increase in mobile carrier charge, thereby increasing the transconductance. All these effects are also described theoretically; the ID-VDcharacteristics could be simulated by computer model based on the physical effects."
"MESFET's with gates 1 µm long were fabricated in LPE layers of InP on Cr-doped InP substrates. The quality of the LPE material is characterized by an electron concentration of 4 × 1015cm-3with a mobility of 2.6 × 104cm2V-1s-1at 77 K for growths from undoped melts. The devices have current gain cutoff frequencies of 20 GHZ or somewhat larger. This value is greater than that of the best analogous GaAs MESFET bya factor of 1.5. A factor of 1.3 is predicted on the basis of a simple theory. The highest power gain cutoff frequency, fmax, for the InP device is 33 GHz which is somewhat smaller than that of the best analogous GaAs device. The lowest minimum noise figure at 10 GHz for these first InP devices is 3.9 dB with an associated gain of 4.8 dB. The best result for the GaAs counterpart is 3.2 dB with an associated gain of 7.8 dB. The power gain of the InP device suffers compared to the GaAs device because of degenerative feedback resulting from a large gate-to-drain capacitance and because of a small output resistance. If the magnitudes of these two equivalent circuit elements were the same for MESFET's in the two materials, fmaxfor the InP device would be more than double its present value."
"A simple model has been used to calculate the fTand hfefalloff in bipolar transistors operating under high-level injection conditions in the collector. The calculated values are in close agreement with the experimental data. Conventional calculations of fTfalloff ignore the effect of the collector capacitance charging time in the calculation of the total emitter-collector delay time [3]. However, it has been shown that, in Kirk's base-widening model [1], the collector capacitance increases significantly in the quasi-saturation region due to a large increase in the stored charge in the collector [4], [11]. It will be shown here that earlier calculations of the fTbehavior have been inadequate and that an accurate prediction of the fTfalloff is possible by calculating the delay time (τ) associated with the total stored charge (Q) in the base and the collector regions using τ = dQ/dIc. It will be shown that the Kirk effect is indeed the dominant physical mechanism in the quasi-saturation region in our devices. This conclusion is consistent with Bowler and Lindholms analysis [5] and with the study of the collector capacitance behavior [4], [11]."
"The relationship between the threshold voltage shift of the n-channel Si-gate MOSFET and the implant dose of boron ions has been examined theoretically and experimentally when these ions are implanted with an energy of 60 keV through a gate oxide of 1200 Å into a p-type silicon substrate of the acceptor concentration of 7 × 1014/cm3. The effect of high-temperature treatment after ion implantation on the threshold voltage shift has been considered. The good agreement between the theory and the experiment verifies that the model used is reasonable. The threshold voltage shift with the dose is expressed by about 5 × 10-12V.cm2below a dose of 5 × 1011ions/cm2. Above this value, the increase of the threshold voltage shift becomes slow and the slope takes the value of about 2 × 10-12V.cm2due to the maximum surface depletion layer."
"Previous analysis shows the IGFET to be dynamically equivalent to a bipolar transistor operating with a base series capacitance equal to the IGFET gate capacitance. This equivalence illuminates the physical reasons for disadvantageous power-delay energy characteristics compared to bipolar devices, devices which operate with Boltzmann barrier principles and thus seem to most closely approach the fundamental power-delay thermal limit. Means for reducing IGFET disadvantages are discussed."
"The drift velocity of electrons and holes in silicon has been measured in a large range of the electric fields (from 3 . 102to 6 . 104V/cm) at temperatures up to 430 K. The experimental data have been fitted with a simple formula for the temperatures of interest. The mean square deviation was in all cases less than 3.8 percent. A more general formula has also been derived which allows to obtain by extrapolation drift velocity data at any temperature and electric field."
"Triode-like operation of junction gate FET's is analyzed by two-dimensional computer simulation. Triode-like characteristics are shown to appear with the channel normally off and the depletion layer reaching the drain electrode. Triode-like current arises from carrier injection from the source electrode into the depleted region. Triode-like operation is achieved without intrinsic material."
"An explicit expression has been derived for the subthreshold slope of an insulated gate field-effect transistor. This expression is used to explore the influence of surface band-bending, gate insulator thickness, substrate doping, substrate bias, and temperature."
"A modified linear sweep technique is described which allows one to rapidly determine the carrier generation rate versus semiconductor depletion width dependence exhibited by deeply depleted MOS-C structures. Although requiring more sophisticated instrumentation, the modified procedure is more flexible, more accurate, and less time-consuming than the original technique."
"Direct-current characteristics of microwave bipolar transistors with emitter-collector spikes are examined. Measured data from a large sample of spiked transistors are evaluated and related to the FET model of a spike. A suitable test for spiking is developed for use in a dc autoprobe program. Typical results from a wafer are presented."

"Ohmic contacts of superior quality are produced by treating the normal alloying process as an epitaxy process, where Ga and As are supplied separately by evaporation together with the normal contact metals and by overpressure, respectively. New device fabrication methods based on this new scheme are the production of shallow p-n junctions, shallow heterojunctions, thin ternary semiconductor layers with different bandgaps from that of the bulk, and multiple structures. By using photoresist, complete regrowth patterns as used for IC's should be possible. The types of devices where these developments should be of interest are solar cells, light-emitting IC patterns, even with different light colors on one chip, Gunn devices, BARITT's, MESFET's, Schottky CCD's, heterojunction bipolar transistors, etc."
"The short-circuit current of a CdTe drift-field photodetector is calculated for lifetimes from 5 × 10-10to 10-7s. It is shown that the optimal drift-field region thicknesses for visible and near-infrared light are between 0.4 and 5 µm. A method for producing such structure is proposed."
"A closed-form solution to Poisson's equation applied to the base-collector region of an integrated bipolar device is developed. The solution comprises an extension to simplified analyses published elsewhere, and it leads to a process-oriented definition of base pushout phenomena, Moreover, the analytical results evolve into practical suggestions for effecting a high-injection simulation of gain and gain-bandwidth product characteristics."
"A small-signal analytical model is developed for a bulk silicon device subjected to avalanche multiplication induced by space-charge effects. Results show that transit-time negative resistance may exist, provided the solid is biased near the onset of the dc negative resistance or above it; this ac negative resistance is into the microwave range for practical devices. The main features of this phenomenon and the differences with respect to IMPATT diodes are pointed out by using suitable approximate expressions which can help in finding the overall frequency behavior. A check of the preceding analysis by a computer solution of the small-signal impedance has also been performed."
"The bias dependent characteristics of the base input flicker noise or 1/f noise current generator in bipolar transistors is examined. A simple technique is presented for the determination of the flicker noise magnitude at selected low frequencies with varying collector bias current. The results indicate that the bias dependence of the flicker noise is intimately rated to that of the input conductance parameter gπin the common-emitter configuration. Practical methods are given for the determination of the bias-independent noise parameter ρ0, which, in conjunction with the small-signal network parameters, fully characterize the device noise performance at low frequencies, ρ0, is an equivalent noise resistance representing the open-circuit flicker noise voltage at the base terminal at 1 Hz. Results of noise figure measurements on several representative commercially available devices are compared with those calculated with a knowledge of ρ0."
"A high-speed bias circuit modulation process which occurs in Gunn oscillators by virtue of their equivalent circuit is shown to also occur in IMPATT oscillators."
"Verification demonstrating operation of the indium-doped silicon infrared-sensing MOSFET (IRFET) is provided. This is a new type of detector for the 3-5-µm infrared wavelength regions, and the detector has been found to operate according to the original design proposal and criteria."

"Silicon has been used for most solar cell applications in the past, owing to the availability of the necessary technology. But from a fundamental materials standpoint, Si is a poor choice. It has a lower-than-optimum bandgap for highest efficiency, a low optical absorption coefficient requiring long lifetime material which is sensitive to radiation damage, and no material with which it forms a high quality heterojunction. III-V semiconductors have properties which avoid these problems and permit greatly improved solar cell performance. High quality heterojunctions have been demonstrated in several III-V systems including In1-xGaxAS1-yPy(1) and Al1-xGaxAs1-yPy(2). Direct bangap materials with hlgh optical absorption coefficients are available with bandgaps from 0.4 to 2.1 eV. These advantages have long been known, but the AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction cell was the first to demonstrate them experimentally."
"Theoretical and experimental analyses show that the higher energy spectral response of an n/p AlxGa1-xAs-GaAs graded band-gap solar cell is substantially greater than that of a similar n/p AlxGa1-xAs-GaAs heteroface cell, particularly for wavelengths below 0.5 µm. The theoretical analysis includes all practical energy loss mechanisms such as photon reflection; surface, bulk, and junction recombination currents; and series resistance. It predicts air mass zero (AMO) efficiencies of 16.7% for standard transport parameters and a surface recombination velocity (S) of1 \\times 10^{6}cm/sec and 17.7% for S =1 \\times 10^{5}cm/sec. Small, preliminary n/p graded band-gap structures have been fabricated using a new LPE, melt mixing growth technique to obtain the graded composition AlxGa1-xAs layer approximately 0.5 µm thick. Comparison of the measured spectral responses of the graded band-gap cell with similar n/p heteroface structures (x = 0.85) demonstrates substantial improvement provided by the graded cell for wavelengths between 0.60 µm and 0.35 µm . Preliminary electrical measurements performed in a calibrated AMO solar simulator on structures with a Si3N4anti-reflection film indicate maximum power conversion efficiency of 13.6% (for zero contact area). This efficiency corresponds to measured short-circuit current density, JSC, of 27.7 ma/cm2, open-circuit voltage, VOC, of 0.88 volts, and fill factor, FF, of 0.76. Individual values of JSCVOC, and FF as high as 28.2 ma/cm2, 0.95 volts, and 0.78 have been measured, each for a separate cell."
"Graded-bandgap pGa1-xAlxAs-pGaAs-nGaAs solar cell structures are analyzed. Such cells allow conversion efficiencies higher than conventional GaAs cells due to the reduction of the surface recombination effect. It is advantageous to use pGaAs layers of 1 µm thickness, since the diffusion length for electrons is 3 to 5 times larger than that for holes. The theoretical conversion efficiency is calculated for AMO(6000K) blackbody radiation and typical parameters assumed. The efficiency strongly depends on the drift field E in the graded-bandgap layer, and the maximum efficiency approaches 20%."
"P(AlxGa1-xAs:Ge)-p(GaAs:Ge)-n+(GaAs:Te) solar cells have been fabricated using multiple layer liquid phase epitaxial (LPE) growth techniques. Germanium was used as the p-type dopant to eliminate impurity diffusion and to maximize minority carrier diffusion lengths. These procedures provide precise control of the thickness and carrier concentration of each individual layer."
"The p-InP/n-CdS solar cell, made of inexpensive raw materials and chemically stable components, is a candidate for large scale applications. Cells with initial efficiencies between 8 and 12.5% (the previously reported maximum) are improved to 14% by a 15 minute anneal in 15% H2+ 85% N2at 550 to 600°C. The main effect of this anneal is to increase the open circuit voltage, VOC, to 0.72 V. We find that the cell characteristics do not change during 15 minute anneals in air up to 400°C. At higher temperatures VOCgoes up as in the forming gas anneals, but the conductivity of the CdS drops. Starting with these observations we have begun a lifetime study."
"A new technique is described for the deposition of SnO2films based upon the pyrolysis of tetramethyltin (TMT) in oxygen at relatively low temperatures (\\simeq 450\\degc). As a source, TMT has the advantages of being stable in air and moisture, and of being a liquid with a relatively high vapor pressure at room temperature. Thus, a simple bubbler system is used to transport its vapors to the reaction chamber. The deposition technique is characterized by (1) high and controllable growth rates (more than 300 Å/min), (2) high conductivity layers (more than 30 Ω cm-1undoped), and (3) highly transparent layers in the visible range more than 95% transmission for 1500 Å layers). In addition, the films can be doped to achieve conductivities as high as 200 cm-1without loss in transmission. Finally, fast, effective low temperature anneals with forming gas in an open tube system can be used to result in a two-fold increase in conductivity."
"A laser scanner is described which can nondestructively explore electrical characteristics of semiconductor devices on a point-by-point basis. The results of applying the scanner to electronically map temperature distributions and hot spots in a power transistor are given. The results of mapping localized nonlinearities in electrical operation and 0.5 GHz response are also presented. Pictures show the progress of logic in a MOS shift register and demonstrate the ability to change at will the logical state of an embedded active cell with the laser."
"An experimental set up combined with a commercial SEM is introduced, which enables the recording of stroboscopical, linearized and contrast isolated quantitative voltage contrast micrographs for frequencies up to 60MHz. This system allows the investigation of integrated circuits with a simultaneous voltage resolution of less than 100mV and a spatial resolution of 0.5 um for a maximum illuminated area of 2mm × 2mm at primary beam energies between 2-30keV."
"Stroboscopic electron beam blanking of a conventional SEM was employed to analyze high speed dynamic RAM operations. In the system described a time resolution of 20 nanoseconds was used to produce voltage contrast (V.C.) images of single events. Also the SEM was operated as a sampling oscilloscope to display timing waveforms from individual circuit nodes. Several types of 4K RAM (MCM6605) operations were analyzed to evaluate this technique in debugging MOS LSI circuits. The operations analyzed were memory cell timing waveforms, data-node storage, and node bootstrapping. The interaction of the SEM with the MCM6605 operation was also analyzed."
"Various attempts have been made to analyze the yield of IC's as a function of active circuit area, using as models different probability distribution functions of spot defects. The purpose of this paper is to show that most of the proposed models form a family of functions which correspond to a parametric family of power transformations from yield to yield to the power λ, the parameter λ defining a particular transformation. A comparison between the power transformation approach to earlier modeling techniques will be discussed. After developing the necessary statistical theory, a simple procedure for the model building process will be presented."
"Practical problems associated with the depth profiling of impurity distributions in silicon and silicon dioxide are illustrated for several widely used surface analysis techniques as applied at a number of laboratories. The methods used for depth profiling were Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The profiles measured for zinc-implanted silicon displayed good overall agreement when presented on a normalized scale, but when presented on an absolute basis displayed large discrepancies attributed to matrix effects and instrumental artifacts. An examination of some typical analysis craters by optical interferometry, stylus profilometry, and scanning electron microscopy revealed severe redeposition of the sputtered material, asymmetrical cavities with concave or convex bottoms, and severe undercutting at material interfaces."
"This paper describes a very high power pulsed coupled-cavity TWT designed specifically for the SOSI radar being built by the Lincoln Laboratory of M.I.T. The tube delivers over 100kW of peak power at duty cycles of UP to 50%, with pulse lengths of 50 milliseconds. The tube is pulsed by use of a modulating anode and operates at a beam voltage of 42kV with a beam current of 10 amps. The measured efficiency at band center is 26% without collector depression. The tube is designed to operate over a 1000MHz bandwidth centered at 10GHz, with a saturated gain of 50dB. The electrical and mechanical design of the tube will be discussed. Measured data of gain amplitude and phase versus frequency will be shown as well as measured data of DC stability."
"The paper describes the design and compares the performance of a hybrid tube and a travelling wave tube. The tubes have identical output sections composed of centipede slow wave structure cavities."
"An existing, PPM-focused high-power traveling wave tube of the coupled-cavity type was mated to a dual-mode gun, capable of providing a perveance (pulse-up) ratio of 6 dB or higher. RF tests were performed at a beam voltage of 31 kilovolts and perveance of approximately 0.15 and 0.65 µpervs. With full RF drive, the beam transmission for the two modes was 0.98 and 0.92 respectively. At the midband frequency (f=9.5 GHz), the output power in the two modes was 2.2 kilowatts and 15.1 kilowatts, the saturated gain 15.5 dB and 30.3 dB, the basic tube efficiency 6.7% and 13% respectively. With a 50% collector depression, these efficiencies could be roughly doubled. By overdriving the high power mode amd slightly underdriving the low power modes, a power output ratio of 10 dB with constant RF can be achieved."
"The development of a 10 dB pulse-up periodic permanent magnet focused high efficiency traveling-wave tube is described and experimental data is presented, Peak power levels of 4600 Watts were attained in the high power pulse mode of operator. Continuous wave power levels of 600 Watts have been demonstrated. Efficiencies up to 47 percent in the pulse mode and 38 percent in the CW mode were achieved. The objective was to obtain both a high average power capability and high efficiency at differing output power levels. A dual mode electron gun was designed and evaluated. Favorable beam characteristics were demonstrated at different perveance levels. Experimental test results shown excellent beam transmission. Shield loading techniques were used to reduce phase velocity dispersion. A helix phase velocity taper was used to improve basic interaction efficiencies. A three-stage, double depressed, collector was added to further improve overall conversion efficiency. Experimental data taken in C-band are presented. The performance of the device represents an advance in the state of the art of high efficiency, high average power, 10 dB pulse up, dual mode traveling-wave tubes."
"The paper describes how strapped anode pulse magnetrons have been made which can be tuned by the application of a voltage to an electrode, which controls the magnitude of a multipactor discharge in a cavity coupled to the magnetron anode."
"A 2-kilowatt average power receiver protector with a 5,000-hour operating life has been developed. The design is of the gas plasma diode hybrid type which heretofore could provide only one-tenth the power handling for equivalent operating life. Predicted life is based on experimentally obtained molecular sorption coefficients performed at 2-kW average power in X-band. The device has been developed for use as a receiver protector in a high-resolution radar to be used at Lincoln Laboratory. This radar will transmit 200 kW average power at X-band and consequently requires a high average power receiver protector."
"During the last decade, an extensive amount of device development work has been done in low signal high frequency microwave transistors, and now these devices are commercially available from several manufacturers. However, high power microwave transistors have only recently been reported (1-4). This paper presents a high voltage microwave power transistor, which has been developed for instrument application at Tektronix, Inc. Some of the design considerations and performance data are reported. Contributing factors for the performance are indicated."
"A power MOSFET is developed which exhibits 20A current, 3000mΩ transconductance and 85V breakdown voltage in a 5×5mm2chip. The features of the device structure are a vertical drain electrode which enables to use most of the surface area for the source electrode and a mesh gate structure which makes able to increase the channel width per unit area, thereby drain current of the device can be increased. The P-channel device with an offset gate structure was fabricated from an N on P+epitaxial wafer by using the polysilicon gate and the ion implantation processes. The device can be operated stably at ambient temperatures up to 180°C."
"This paper describes a new high power, diffused gate, vertical channel, triode-like JFET, fabricated utilizing self-aligned, heavily doped polycrystalline silicon source contacts. These techniques make it possible to realize a high source gate breakdown voltage device. Since the voltage amplification factor of this JFET is determined by the channel space charge region profile, device design requires only gate impurity diffusion depth control, which is very easy. Output I-V characteristics attained for a 4 × 4 mm chip with 5520 channels designed for audio use are; a voltage amplification factor of 5, Idssof 5A at Vds= 10V, a 60V source-gate breakdown voltage and a 200V drain-gate breakdown voltage. The device is operated as a push-pull amplifier which delivers a 50W signal to an 8Ω load."
"The npn and pnp high-voltage transistors showing high reliabilities have been developed by using semi-insulating polycrystalline-silicon (SIPOS) films for the surface passivation. SIPOS films are chemically vapor-deposited polycrystalline-silicon doped with oxygen or nitrogen atoms. SIPOS films employed for the surface passivation of high-voltage transistors are composed of triple layers, which are oxygen-doped films of 0.5 µm thickness to stabilize the silicon interface, nitrogen-doped films of 0.15 µm thickness to prevent water or sodium ions from reaching the silicon surface and silicon dioxide films to prevent dielectric breakdown. The npn and pnp SIPOS transistors rated at 800 V and 2500 V have been produced in planar-like structures with field-limiting rings. Furthermore, 10 kV SIPOS transistors with multiple rings have been fabricated and found that operation is stable."
"It is shown that high avalanche breakdown voltage in both plane and planar p-n junctions can be achieved by extending the heavily doped side of the junction beyond the contact and partially etching into it. The technique, when properly applied, is capable of giving virtually ideal breakdown voltages for both plane and planar type p-n junctions and uses only a fraction of the area required for a typical negative bevel. The actual breakdown voltage depends on how carefully the etch is controlled. For planar junctions the breakdown voltages that can now be achieved are better than any previously reported. Moreover, since the technique is based on etching, mechanical contouring is avoided. This. in itself, is beneficial. The new method is illustrated both by exact calculations and by several experiments. Included in the calculations are a comparison of the new method to the 6° negative bevel for applications involving plane junctions and a comparison of the new method (for planar junctions) with the single floating field limiting ring approach."
"In this paper the mechanisms of bandgap narrowing, Shockly-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination, Auger recombination, and carrier-carrier and carrier-lattice scattering are included in an exact one-dimensional model of a bipolar transistor. The transistor is used as a vehicle for studying the relative importance of each of these phenomena in determining emitter efficiency in devices with emitter junction depths of 1µm to 8µm. It is shown that band gap narrowing is the dominant influence for devices with shallow emitters of 2µm or less and that SRH recombination dominates for emitter depths greater than 4µm. Calculations are also presented showing the effects of the emitter surface concentration and high level injection on the current gain for devices with emitter junction depths of 1 µm to 8µm. It is shown that there is an optimum surface concentration of5\\times10^{19}cm-3for the 1µm emitter depth but no optimum under 1021cm-3for devices with emitter depths greater than 4µm."
"The diffusion of Pt into Si at temperatures between 800 and 1000°C has been found to provide room-temperature minority-carrier lifetimes between 1 µsec and 10 nsec. Evaluation of the dependence of lifetime on ambient temperature and on majority carrier doping as well as the measurement of thermally stimulated currents indicate the presence of two recombination centers: an acceptor located 0.26 eV below the conduction band edge for n-type Si and a donor located 0.32 eV above the valence band edge for p-type Si."
"Red light emitting diodes (6610 Å at 300°K) have been fabricated in GaAS1-xPx(x\\sim38%) by implanting Be at multiple energies chosen to produce a uniform Be profile with a junction depth of about 1 µm. Low temperature photoluminescence and sheet resistivity measurements indicate that annealing the Be implanted GaAs0.62P0.38for 1 hour at 900°C with Si3N4encapsulation reorders the lattice and activates the implanted Be. The Be related luminescence is not observed after about 1.3 µm is removed from the surface, suggesting that there is no significant diffusion of the implanted Be during anneal. From electroluminescence and photoluminescence data the Be acceptor level is estimated to be 20.2 ± 2 meV above the valence band. The red LED's exhibit an external quantum efficiency of1.07 \\times 10^{-2}."
"High energy electron bombardment produces high resistivity layers in n-type GaAsP. The resistivity of the specimen varied from\\sim 0.2 \\Omega-cm to\\sim 10^{6} \\Omega-cm by the irradiation of\\sim 1.2 \\times 10^{16}electrons./ cm2at 7MeV. The light-emitting diodes (LED's) irradiated in this condition did not exhibit the any optical radiation. It will be shown that this new technique is useful for isolating GaAsP junction devices."
"The purpose of this work was to fabricate large junction-isolated monolithic XY addressable LED arrays in GaAsP for use in continuous matrix displays. This work represents a significant advance over the current state of the art. Monolithic junction-isolated arrays0.5\" \\times 0.5\"have been fabricated incorporating two-level metal interconnections to form an XY addressable LED array. Each0.5\" \\times 0.5\"monolithic chip contains a 30 × 36 array (1080 LEDs), The LEDs are 0.005\" square and are placed on 0.014\" centers. Four of these monolithic array chips have been assembled side by side to form a0.5\" \\times 2.0\", 30 \\times 144continuous matrix display (4320 LEDs). This display has been used to display 32 α-N characters, 2 rows of 16 characters, using a 7 × 9 format in a 9 × 15 field which permits upper and lower case characters as well as some graphic information."
"The optical principles for stretching the segments of displays using specular reflector/diffuse reflector/light guide are compared. A new technique to form light guides by injection molding has been developed. The polycarbonate material used in this process has an index of refraction n = 1.6 and hence a better angle of total reflection compared to the commonly used epoxy material. This allows a higher light transmission from the LED pellet to the bar and hence a good brightness and brightness distribution of the bar in the \"on status\". In this design the light guides are formed upon a specular reflecting lead frame with the attached seven LED-pellets and finally masked by a properly shaped cover. The reflectivity of the cover and of the bar in the \"off status\" has been measured under various ambient light levels and optimized for best readability. Whereas most displays have a \"black\" cover the new design rule calls for a \"gray value\" of the cover equal to the \"gray value\" of the bars. The improved contrast and readability at high ambient light levels for this design and others will be shown. This design is fully compatible with the commonly used color filters for contrast enhancement and allows further design flexibility not only for red but also for yellow and green displays."
"In this paper we report the extension of the resolution to 30 lpi so that the 6 x 6 inch plate now consists of ~28,000 individually addressable elements. In addition, a significantly increased lit area per element is reported as well as major improvements in device performance."
"Thin film transistor (TFT) arrays have significant potential for parallel optical processing applications. The design fabrication and operation of 128×128, 1 sqins, TFT-photoconductor-electroluminescent array is described. It performs the logical \"NOT\" function at every picture point and also provides amplification."
"Metal-insulator-semiconductor solar cells have been studied on silicon. The emphasis in this report is on M-I-S cells fabricated on n-type silicon. Results for M-S cells on this material have been poor to-date with efficiencies of only about 2% having been achieved at open circuit voltages of 0.250 volts. Using M-I-S cells on n-type silicon efficiencies of almost 9% have been obtained at open circuit voltages of better than 0.4 volts. Increase in the short circuit current has also been seen."
"The efficiency of p-n junction solar cells is limited by the high sheet resistivity of the semiconductor. Schottky barrier solar cells, while not limited by this resistivity problem, suffer from low output voltage. The output voltage of Schottky barrier cells is proportional to the logarithm of the ratio of the light current to the dark current. The dark current is, in turn, proportional to the exponential of the barrier height. Thus, high barrier height means high open circuit voltage. Barrier height can be controlled through the surface states and through the use of thin insulating layers between the metal gate and the semiconductor. In this paper, the results of theoretical and experimental studies on barrier height control are presented. Data on the effect of barrier height on open circuit voltage are presented. Particular attention is paid to the role of oxide thickness and minority carriers in the semiconductor space charge region in determining barrier height. It is shown both theoretically and experimentally that MIS solar cells can approach the performance of a commerical p-n junction solar cell."
"Individual processing steps have been varied to determine the effect on Schottky barrier solar cell (SBSC) performance. A Si. wafer produces a better fill factor and current than does Si. Silicon resistivity of 0.4 or 2 Ω-cm results in comparable cells. Sputter deposition of the metal causes the metal atoms to penetrate the silicon which produces a lower voltage as a result of a reduced barrier height. I-V data suggest the presence of a tunneling component in the current. This is verified by an activation energy plot. A better understanding of these current mechanisms should lead to improved solar cell efficiency."
"Photoemission spectroscopy techniques for measuring occupied and unoccupied semiconductor surface states will be described, including a new yield spectroscopy technique for measuring empty surface states both on clean surfaces and in the presence of a thin metal overlayer (i.e. metal-semiconductor interface). Recent results will be discussed which show that, in general, intrinsic semiconductor surface states (whose energy positions are not simply related to band gap energies) play an important role in determining schottky barrier energies on cleaved (110) 111-V semiconductors. In several cases, these intrinsic semiconductor surface states appear to be largely unaffected by metal overlayers, while in other cases metal-surface state interactions are observed. "
"To make a significant impact on the total National energy supply by any form of solar energy utilization, two basic conditions will have to be met: 1). The systems will have to be installed over an adequately large area, and 2). The systems will have to be sold at an adequately low price to permit such large scale instalation without upsetting the economic system. The second statement means, that complete photovoltaic systems, which will be in competition with other methods of generating electric power such as coal fired or nuclear plants will have to be sold in the range of 20 to 100 $/m2of receiver area based on current values. The annual production rate required to achieve significant impact within 20 years is around 500km2, a million times the current production rate."
"A recently developed induced junction solar cell (1) has been electrically characterized to determine its performance and how it may be improved through process optimization. Prototype cells are described in terms of their structure, fabrication and advantages over diffused junction cells. Several devices were subjected to ionizing radiation in the form of low energy electrons and x-rays. The novel methods used for electron irradiation and measuring its effect on the cells are described. While large variations in oxide charge and flatband voltage were observed, only minimal effects on the cells photovoltaic behaviour resulted. The radiation induced changes were found to be annealable."
"Solar cells consisting of heterojunctions between p-silicon wafers and transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) have been fabricated and characterized. The motivation for such cells was to investigate inexpensive, low temperature processing techniques not involving diffusion. The new advances are: (1) the successful use of a solar cell front layer of nearly transparent, but highly conductive ITO and (2) the incorporation of ion-beam sputtering in the fabrication process. The cells are fabricated by placing oxidized silicon wafers in a 4-inch ion beam. The silicon dioxide is sputter etched and 2000 Å of ITO are deposited during the same pumpdown. This technique yields as-sputtered films of2 \\times 10^{-4}r-cm resistivity and light transmissivity above 80 percent over the visible spectrum. The finished cells have an open circuit voltage of 0.45 volts and a short circuit current of 12.5 ma/cm2. The curve fill factor is 0.6. This yields a maximum output of 3.4 mw/cm2and an efficiency of 3.3%."
"The operating frequency of RCA's power GaAs MESFET amplifiers has been extended to 18 GHz. We have achieved 225 mW CW output power with 4.5 dB gain at 18 GHz from a 1200 µm source periphery device. At 15 GHz the same device yielded 451 mW output power with 5.2 dB gain with a power added efficiency of 12.5%. Under class B operating conditions we have achieved power added efficiencies as high as 68% at 4 GHz with a power output of 261 mW and a gain of 9.6 dB. The drain efficiency at this point was 77%. At 8 GHz, the highest power added efficiency achieved was 41.5% with 302 mW output power and 6.9 dB gain. A theoretical model has been formulated for the MESFET class B amplifiers. The calculated results are in good agreement with experimental data."
"Sulphur implantation into semi-insulating GaAs has been used to fabricate 1,5µ-gate-MESFETs showing microwave gain equivalent to epitaxial FETs (MAG = 10 dB at 10 GHz) but higher noise. Room temperature implantation of S at an energy of 30 keV and a dose of 5.1012cm-2sputtered SiO2and Si3N4as encapsulants and heat treatments from 820 to 900°C have been used. Electrical activation was found to, depend critically on the substrate material. Si3N4-encapsulation gave slightly higher electrical activation than SiO2."
"The results of a short study into the reliability and failure modes of GaAs FETs are presented. Two failure modes have been observed during this study, and improved fabrication techniques that reduce their occurrence have been examined. The results obtained indicate that extremely reliable devices can be manufactured with a predicted mean time to failure in excess of 107hours at junction temperatures of 70°C. Room temperature life tests in excess of ½ million device hours lend support to these predictions."
"Failure modes have been studied experimentally on a low-noise one-micron aluminum gate GaAs FET. Several life tests, including high temperature storage, power burn-in, and gate biasing at elevated temperature, were carried out on more than 200 samples. It has been revealed that gradual degradation of source and drain contact resistance is the major life-determining failure mode. MTTF was estimated to be about 109hours for channel temperature of 80°C. Surge tests were also carried out. In some specimens, reversible drift of electrical parameters was observed. This instability seems to be related with deep level trapping centers in the GaAs epitaxial layer substrate interface."
"A dynamic one-dimensional analysis of electron transport from source to drain in GaAs and InP short-channel FETs is used to determine the effects of device cooling and channel length on both gain-bandwidth product and optimum noise figure of these devices. The analysis models intervalley scattering using a Monte Carlo calculation method. It is shown that both GaAs and InP FETs should exhibit excellent noise performance, virtually limited only by the values of such parasitic elements as source and drain resistances and feedback capacitances. InP is shown to be marginally superior to GaAs in terms of independence of optimum noise figure on channel field."
"This paper describes the principles of a method for the solution of electron optics problems which has led to significant design improvements in traveling wave tubes over the past few years. In contrast to Conventional procedures which solve Poisson's equation on square meshes, the space within the problem boundaries is filled with a network of irregular triangles resembling a stretched fishnet laid out by the computer itself. The technique has found its greatest use in the design of high-performance electron guns. The high accuracy and resolution of this method has enabled numerous better guns. The approach has also been used to analyze beam focussing arrangements, multistage depressed collectors, CRT guns and lenses, and problems obeying Laplace's equation. The procedure can be used for calculation of ion beam optics as well."
"This paper is a progress report on the continuing effort toward more efficient and more precise design and analysis of helix-type TWTs through the use of time-sharing computers. The use of computer programs for the design of helix-type TWTs is not new. The TWT theoretical models on which such computer programs are based were developed years ago and are adequately described in the published literature. What is relatively new to the design engineer is his access to large-scale digital computers made available by many time-sharing computer services."
"Two effective selective loss coupling schemes for oscillation prevention in high power travelling-wave tubes (TWTs) have been described. Experimental TWTs are being constructed to test both of these methods and some results are expected prior to the conference. The authors believe that these basic techniques can be modified and adapted to other important applications, such as the design of the PPM focused dual mode or high peak power helix TWTs."
"In a joint USAF-NASA Program, Lewis Research Center is carrying out an efficiency improvement program on TWTs for use in ECMs by applying multistage depressed collector (MDC) and spent beam refocusing techniques developed at Lewis. In the analytic part of the effort, 3-D electron trajectories are used throughout the 10-18% (electronic) efficient, 4.8-9.6GHz bandwidth, 400-600 W CW TWT, the spent beam re-focuser and the depressed collector. Collector efficiency, collector losses and overall efficiency are identified and computed. On the experimental side, tube performance is evaluated first without the MDC, then the spent beam is analyzed for symmetry, circularity and the velocity spread. Finally, the MDC is attached and its performance optimized and evaluated. Theory predicts a MDC-efficiency of 84% for a 4 stage,3\"\\times2\"size MDC which can be achieved with symmetric and circular beams."
"Materially improved color television picture resolution performance results from the use of a new type of electron lens. Contemporary picture tube electron guns utilize lenses which originated with the inception of the science of electron optics. They exhibit rapid growth in electron beam spot size at high current levels. This has precluded the attainment of full NTS system performance - frequently limiting highlight resolution to less than 100 lines. A new five-element lens is described. The length and potential of its elements are selected in a manner which minimizes lens aberrations. Electron guns employing the new lens structure produce more than twice the highlight resolution of comparable guns using ordinary lenses and offer reduced sensitivity to mechanical construction imperfections."
"It is argued that the future for the engineer in the solar technologies is bright as the US Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) is coming to grips with the challenges offered to assure the US' energy supplies and about the role of the engineering profession in accomplishing that task. ERDA's role of \"option generator\" is described. In that role ERDA will play a significant part not just for the next few years; ERDA is charged with short, medium, and long-term responsibilities lasting beyond the year 2000."
"Integrated injection logic devices based on vertical NPN transistors and lateral PNP injectors, and fabricated using ion-implant doping exclusively are described. Two basic processes are outlined. One uses an implanted low-energy boron pre-deposited layer, thermally driven in, to form the NPN base and p+injectors. The other process uses high-energy implanted boron to form the active base region of the NPN device below the silicon surface. Both techniques use ion-implanted phosphorus for the n+collectors and collars. Results of speed-power measurements for a 7-stage ring oscillator and a 50-stage inverter string are described. The high-energy implanted boron process can be used together with Schottky-barrier collectors to further reduce the power-delay product."
"Present I2L devices are limited in usable speed and current gain by the low performance of the inverse NPN transistor made with conventional bipolar processes. This report discusses new I2L structure variations that overcome these limitations. In addition, a new process is described where the intended isolation regions are anodized to form a conduction barrier. This new I2L II Process has already yielded NPN transistors with hFE= 250 and fT= 250MHz and is expected to extend I2L further into the high end of the speed power curve with fT> 500MHz and propagation delays of 5ns."
"Aluminum-silicon junctions, such as those used in Schottky T2L and I2L technologies are shown to be sensitive to the heat treatments (HT) encountered in the I.C. processing. The barrier height of Al- nSi clamping diodes φbnincreases with the heat treatment while that of Al- p Si (ohmic) contacts φbpdecreases. The magnitudes of the barrier height changes are dependent upon the HT temperature, Al thickness and cooling rate and can be several tenths of an eV. In-depth Auger analysis of the HT contacts reveals the formation of anoAl-rich (p+) surface layer (of\\simeq 100-200Å) which is responsible for the barrier height changes."
"A general purpose p-channel Si-Gate MOS technology has been developed and characterized. The technology uses local oxidation and contains: (a) a -1.0 volt enhancement mode MOSFET, (b) a process-variable threshold voltage depletion mode MOSFET, and (c) an n/p/n process-variable gain bipolar output device. Application of the technology to beam leaded high voltage RAM circuits has created a family of special memory products for use within the Bell System. Additionally, by making use of the depletion mode MOSFET and the bipolar output device, high speed, low voltage (5 volt) TTL compatible logic circuits are realized."
"A newly developed n-channel Si-gate technology, \"Gate Oxidation Method\" (G.O.M.), uses high resistivity substrates (20Ω.cm) and only one boron ion implantation process. The E-mode transistor threshold voltage is controlled by the lost boron ions into the growing gate oxide."
"A high speed, LSI, n-channel Si-Gate technology has been developed and characterized for the manufacture of integrated circuits. Utilizing the advantages of local oxidation and ion implantation, a technology is achieved which is: (a) fabricated on high resistivity Si substrates; (b) quasi-planar in topological structure; (c) completely adjustable in gate threshold voltage (enhancement and depletion modes) and field threshold voltage; and (d) highly reproducible in electrical parameter control. Additionally, by employing a thin gate insulator structure (SiO2, 750Å) a factor of 4 increase in gain is realized with respect to standard p-channel MOSFETs. 4,096 bit dynamic RAM circuits have been designed and fabricated in this technology. Typical access times of ∼ 50 nanoseconds with high circuit yields are realized."
"BEAMOS, for Beam Addressed Metal Oxide Semiconductor, is a new technology for auxiliary memories based on an electron beam which reads and writes data on a simple unstructured MOS chip. Its performance features include large bit capacity (>30 \\times 10^{6}bits/module), rapid access time (<30 microseconds), high data transfer rates, nonvolatile storage and low cost in comparison with memories of comparable performance. The memory component is rugged, all electronic, and relatively insensitive to temperature and vibration, making it especially attractive for military applications. Its fast access time should provide considerable performance improvement in both commercial and military computer systems."
"A 16,384-bit charge-coupled device (CCD) memory has been developed for mass storage memory system application where moderate latency, high data rate and low system cost are required. The chip measures only 136 × 169 mil2to fit a standard 16-pin package and is organized as four separate shift registers of 4096 bits. A condensed serial-parallel-serial (CSPS) structure was found to provide the highest packing density. Only two external clocks are required driving capacitances of 60pf each at one-half the data transfer rate. Operation at data rates of 100KHz to 10MHz have been demonstrated experimentally, the on-chip power dissipation at 10MHz being less than 20µW/bit."
"It is clearly better to use the highly conductive molybdenum (Mo) film than polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) film as a floating gate from the consideration of the image force effect. We propose a new mode of operation for floating gate type electrically reprogrammable nonvolatile memory. The proposed memory has the P-channel MNOS structure with the floating molybdenum gate. This floating gate is charged positively (\"WRITE\") by means of nonavalanche mechanism (the Schottky emission from floating gate to the Si substrate), and charged negatively (\"ERASE\") by the avalanche breakdown at the source and/or drain junction. The advantage of this type of memory is that it can be operated with only negative voltages. The unit cell consists of a MNMoOS and a MNOS transistor. The method of the bit selection in the cases of \"WRITE\" and \"ERASE\" operations is explained in detail, and the fully decoded 256-bit memory array is produced with 200 Å SiO2and 800 Å Si3N4gate structures. The typical value of the writing and that of the erasing voltage of this device are respectively -30 V and -20 V for 1 ms pulse duration."
"In this paper, the practical circuit configuration of the dynamic shift register utilizing the Gunn domain is proposed and in order to demonstrate its utility, two stage shift register with the clock rate of 1.6 GHz was fabricated as a monolithically integrated circuit on an epitaxial GaAs. The improved fabrication technique was used to obtain the experimental circuit. The successful operation was confirmed under DC biased condition."
"A charge coupled F.E.T. array is described which gives an amplified, non-destructive measure of the size of the charge packet under each electrode of a CCD line. The basic concept uses the fact that the surface potential and consequently the depth of the depletion layer under any electrode of a CCD line is sensitive to the size of the Charge packet under that electrode. As a result, an integral array of F.E.T's can be formed simply by changing the electrode structure of one of the phases. Results from a four bit surface channel device in an n-type layer on a p-type substrate are used to illustrate the basic properties of the device."
"A memory cell capable of storing multilevel or analog information and providing random-access operation with nondestructive readout has been studied. It used a single junction field-effect transistor as the storage cell. Experimental and analytical studies suggest that eight or sixteen level operation should be feasible with refresh operations every 0.1 to 1 second; cell area can be under 2 mil2."
"In quest of higher efficiency, major progress has occurred in solar cell technology during the last five years. In this period cell efficiency has climbed about 50 percent. Technical approaches leading to increased output include back surface fields (n+-p-p+structures), shallow junctions, improved antireflection coatings, surface texturizing, and fine grid patterns on the cell surface. The status of current solar cell technology and its incorporation into cell production is discussed. Research and develomnent leading to improved performance and reduced cost are also described."
"Epitaxial silicon solar cell structures have been grown on both single crystal, as well as polycrystalline EFG \"ribbon\" substrates. Using EFG substrates, a comparison is made of the material, and electrical characteristics of solar cells fabricated from grown epitaxial junctions and those formed by direct diffusion into the ribbon. Efficiencies of 10% (AM-1) have been achieved with the epitaxial structures, which are substantially higher than achieved by diffusion. The improvement is shown to result mainly from the lower saturation current density of the epitaxial junctions. Epitaxial single crystal P+/P/N/N+solar cell structures containing intentionally graded N-base regions were also studied. Near ideal I-V characteristics were obtained with an open circuit voltage of 636 mv, fill factor of 0.79 and AM-1 efficiency of 12.6%."
"A proven semiconductor device analysis computer code has been used to numerically simulate back-surface-field silicon solar cells. The insight afforded by the one-dimensional solutions of ca~rrier transport in these cells has enabled the identification of pertinent physics describing the operation of these devices. With this analytical knowledge, discussions concerning the essential properties of an effective BSF solar cell were presented. The practicality of using silicon BSF cells for terrestrial applications, specifically in high-temperature, multiple-sun environments, was examined through the use of the device analysis code. The results of this study are encouraging and suggest that the highest-efficiency, most economical solar cells of the future may well be high-resistivity back-surface-field silicon cells."
"Ribbons characterized in this study were grown from two R.F. induction heated stations. Growth atmosphere was argon with hydrogen. The hydrogen was used to suppress arcing in the furnace. Graphite dies used in the growth were thoroughly cleaned and baked in an HC1 atmosphere to remove the heavy metal impurities. The silicon melt was phosphorous and boron doped to obtain 1 Ω-cm, n- and p-type ribbons respectively. Single crystal seeds fabricated from Cz wafers and previously grown ribbons were used as seeds. Typical growth rates were 0.75 to 0.80 inches per minute. The crystallographic orientation and structure of the ribbons was measured along the length, at given intervals, and across the width. The smallest ribbon was twenty feet in length, while the longest ribbon was eighty feet long. Structural studies were performed using the X-ray back reflection h u e technique and preferential chemical etching followed by optical microscopy."
"Solar cell structures have been prepared by the successive deposition of p-type and n+-type silicon layers on p+- type metallurgical-grade silicon substrates using the thermal reduction of trichlorosilane containing appropriate dopants. When metallurgical-grade silicon plates prepared by the solidification technique were used as substrates, the effects of grain boundaries on the dark current-voltage characteristics and conversion efficiency of solar cells were found to be reduced by increasing the dopant concentration in the p-layer. Using zone-refined metallurgical-grade silicon as the substrate, conversion efficiencies up to 8% have been obtained."
"The use of solar concentrators can significantly reduce the cost of solar energy conversion, provided that the photovoltaic cells can be operated at high efficiencies under high illumination conditions. This paper describes the design, fabrication, and results of testing a cell with interdigitated p+and n+fingers on the unilluminated side of the solar cell. This design significantly reduces the problems of series resistance, contact grid shadowing, and voltage saturation which limit the performance of conventionally designed solar cells at high illumination intensities. The performance of such a cell at illumination intensities up to 22 watts/cm2is also presented."
"A new class of silicon solar cell has been developed. The theory of this cell is described. The cell was fabricated by the epitaxial growth of npnpnp six layers on n+-type silicon subtrate and the p+diffusion layer formed onto the top epitaxial n-layer. An oxygen-doped polycrystalline-silicon(SIPOS) layer which has the refractive index of 2 was deposited onto the cell as an antireflection film. The size of the cell was 0.8 × 0.8 cm2and about 20 % of the surface area was covered by a contact metal grid. The series resistance of this cell was measured to be 0.012Ω. In direct sunlight of 80 mW/cm2at AM 1, the output power of the cell was 5.5 mW at 35 °C, which corresponded to 10.8 % in efficiency. By the effective concentration of 623 suns, the output power of the cell was 3.52 W at 56°C, corresponding to 11.1% in efficiency."
"A two-dimensional computer model has been developed for the experimental investigation of the correct turn-on in various types of amplifying gate thyristors, i.e, of the reliable firing at the auxiliary emitter prior to the main one. The accuracy of the computations was proved by the features of several groups of standard and fast turn-off thyristors with amplifying gate. The results of investigation, performed in this paper for dual ring gate thyristors, lead to the improvement of the turn-on reliability in thyristors, having essentially the same very high di/dt capability in any possible turn-on conditions."
"A one-dimensional solution for the distribution of carriers and potential within a planar thyristor will be given. The analysis uses dimensions and physical data obtained from actual device structures. The simulation includes SRH- and Auger recombination mechanisms and Avalanche multiplication as well as mobility saturation effects. The relations between the various internal mechanisms and the different regions of the transfer characteristic are identified. This correlation is required for technological optimization of device performance."
"A new super power RSR known as the T60 has been evolved from the successful, lower power T40 RSR. It is intended for application as the switch element in high power pulsers and modulators. The device is capable of switching 5000 Amps at 1200 volts and is well suited for stacking to higher voltages. Like its predecessor, the T40, the T60 is a two-terminal, four layer PNPN device closely related to the SCR or Thyristor. Unlike the SCR, however, it has no gate and is triggered by a rate of increase in anode-cathode voltage (dv/dt triggered). Dv/dt triggering results in a very large initial conduction area so that the device is capable of very high rate of current rise at turn-on. Current rise in excess of 2500 A/µsec to 5000 A are typical. Device characteristics, test procedures, test results, and applications are discussed. The device development was sponsored by the Air Force Weapons Lab, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico."
"Light activated power thyristors require relatively high optical trigger power, which can be supplied by expended GaAs light emitters only. The dv/dt sensitivity is an essential limitation for the reduction of minimum trigger power. Optimizing of the emitter shunts and p-base sheet resistivity results in an already acceptable compromise. Better results are obtained by a gate structure which avoids dv/dt-triggering by internal compensation."
"Plasma in the turn-on pnpn-structur could be contracted into a narrow filament by the turn-off base current, and this filament could be moved over the area of pnpn-structure. This effect was used for moving the plasma filament along a linear structure consisting of a number of pnpn-elements with a common emitter and a thick base. In the structure-\"pulse distributor\"-the turn-off base current pulses applied between the common base-common emitter contacts permit the plasma filament to be moved from element to element."
"The Field Controlled Thyristor is a new medium power (650V, 20A) switching element. In the on condition the FCT operates as a p-i-n rectifier with a correspondingly low forward voltage drop. Conductivity modulation of the FCT's base region allows it to handle higher current densities than a power transistor with a comparable voltage rating. The device owes its uniqueness to its planar grid structure which gives it both current interrupt and forward blocking capability. The FCT is not a regenerative device and is not \"fired\" into the on state. This results in both higher dv/dt and di/dt ratings than a conventional thyristor."
"A technique for obtaining gray scale in ac plasma display panels is described which uses only one discharge site per resolution element, does not require extensive electronic memory and provides a continuous, broad intensity range. A maintain voltage is applied to all elements of the display panel whose magnitude is somewhat less than the lower limit of the bistable region in which ac plasma panels are normally operated. The application of a trigger voltage initiates a sequence of discharges of diminishing intensity which continues for a substantial number of cycles before dying out. The number of cycles that the discharge sequence persists depends on the magnitude and duration of the addressing trigger voltage. If the panel is operated in a refresh mode, the average brightness of the light emitted may be controlled by varying the magnitude of the trigger pulse voltage. The gray scale method may be used to address a matrix display panel with video information using line-at-a-time addressing."
"Electrochromic devices for use as alphanumeric displays have been the subject of recent interest. Their optical absorption is changed when current passes through them or if exposed to uv light. Electrochromic materials are generally transition metal compounds such as WO3and MoO3. Some people have suggested coloration occurs by electrochemical redox. Others have proposed that coloration results from electron filling of deep traps incorporated during film deposition. We studied electrical and (uv) photo-coloration of MoO3and found that both electrical and photo-coloration are accompanied by a chemical phase change. Based on this, together with electrical charging/discharging characteristics, the conclusion is reached that both photo-and electro-chromism in such materials is chemical in nature. The significance of this, regarding electrochromic devices is discussed."
"The development of a solid state electro-chromic device for display applications is reported in this paper. The electro-chromic structure consists of a multilayer thin film system and therefore, successful fabrication of it requires optimization of each constituent layer with respect to various deposition parameters. We discuss the physical principle, the fabrication methods and operational characteristics of a typical system. Some of the other systems involving \"super-ionic conductors\" and impurity doped systems are also considered."
"We describe a modified Triode Optical Gate (TOG) liquid crystal device that exhibits a very effective electrically driven erase or turn-off operation. The modified device retains the gating, modulation, and enhancement characteristics of the original. These operations, along with the new erase mode, depend on rotation of the direction of the electric field applied to the liquid crystal by a three terminal electrode structure. The paper will also present an analyses of TOG operation in terms of the spacial distribution of the fields, and give experimental results on a one-dimensional array of devices operating in a time-scanned mode."
"Liquid-crystal electrothermo-optic effects are studied with changing temperature of the liquid-crystal cell subjected to an applied field. A liquid crystal becomes opaque in a higher temperature region and transparent in a lower temperature region below the transition temperature from the mesophase to the isotropic phase. By this contrast, a thermally addressed display is demonstrated for dynamic figures. IT is also demonstrated that the display can be changeably used for dynamic or static figures."
"In multi-carrier operation, TWTs exhibit an intermodulation distortion power of typically 10 to 12 dB below the carrier at saturation. The distortion is commonly reduced by operating the tube below saturation, but at the expense of tube efficiency. A study was conducted on optimizing the design of G-band TWTs capable of amplifying between 4 and 16 equal-amplitude signals with a carrier-to-IM distortion power ratio of at least 20 dB, and demonstrating an overall efficiency of 25 percent minimum. The approach was to operate the tubes backed off from saturation for low distortion, and utilize a four-stage depressed collector to achieve the efficiency. Detailed designs satisfying the IM requirements were derived for a 1 kW PPM-focused tube and a 10 kW solenoid-focused tube operating in the band 4.4 to 5.0 GHz. The coupled-cavity circuits were operated closer to beam-RF wave synchronism than in standard designs. The analysis consisted of deriving the TWT transfer functions (output power and phase versus input power), computing the multi-carrier IM levels from the transfer characteristics, and establishing the collector design and performance from trajectory calculations and spent beam energy distributions."
"Large signal studies on octave bandwidth traveling-wave tubes show that significant improvements in tube linearity can be achieved with harmonic injection, in addition to efficiency enhancements and suppression of parasitic harmonic signals. In multisignal operation considerable reduction of the intermodulation distortion can be expected with this scheme. This requires that the injected harmonic signals be optimized in amplitude and phase with respect to the fundamental signals. In practice the harmonic signals can be generated with an octave bandwidth driver tube, and a harmonic conditioner can be designed to optimize the injection conditions. With two and four simultaneous signals improvements in intermodulation distortion by about 6 dB have been demonstrated at saturation with intermodulation levels of approximately 18 dB below the signals."
"A two-level 600/1200 watt CW, X-band, coupled cavity traveling-wave tube featuring low distortion characteristics and air cooling enhanced by the use of heat pipes is described in this paper. This lightweight tube was developed for military communication ground terminals, under the sponsorship of the U.S. Army Electronics Command, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. The tube is PPM focused and incorporates heat pipes on the RF circuit to uniformly distribute the relatively high thermal loads and ensure reliable air cooling. The tube provides either 600 or 1200 watts of saturated CW output power over the frequency band 7.9 to 8.4 GHz. Two levels of saturation are achieved by varying the voltage on an isolated anode, which increases the effective perveance of the electron gun. Gain variations of less than 1. 2 dB have been achieved across the 500 MHz band."
"The authors describe the particular development of a low-power (5 watts at ~36 GHz) helix travelling-wave tube (TWT) for satellite use. In this respect, the TWT design was configured for typical space communication specifications such as low distortion characteristics, maximum efficiency, and high reliability. The main thrust of this paper, however, is related to the technological aspects which have made possible the fabrication and performanocfe this Ka-band TWT"
"Techniques consistent with high efficiency over a wide dynamic power range were utilized in the design of this multi-mode traveling-wave tube. Design objectives included the achievement of high efficiency at all three RF output power levels. A modulation-anode type electron gun is utilized. Mode control is afforded by changing a single anode potential. The gun generates electron beams which are capable of supporting suitable beam-circuit wave interaction in all three power modes. The tube was designed for use on the MARISAT program which is aimed at providing UHF communication for the Navy along with L-band maritime communication for commercial shipping."
"Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) has matured over the past three years to a point where useful microwave devices have been demonstrated and with some improvement there is potential for active optical devices. The GaAs hyperabrupt varactor, IMPATT diode, FET, mixer diode, and injection laser have been prepared with MBE. While GaAs layers can be prepared by MBE with electrical and optical properties comparable to those grown by liquid phase epitaxy (LPE), MBE also can be used to fabricate various structures that may be difficult by other growth methods."
"Since knowledge of the hardness dependence upon processing and design parameters is essential in producing hardened integrated circuits, we have undertaken a comprehensive investigation of the effects of both process and design optimization on radiation-hardened CMOS integrated circuits. The goals of our study are to define and establish a radiation-hardened processing sequence for CMOS integrated circuits and to formulate quantitative relationships between process and design parameters and the radiation hardness. Using these equations, the basic CMOS design can then be optimized for radiation hardness and some understanding of the basic physics responsible for the radiation damage can be gained. Studying radiation effects in MOS devices increases our basic understanding of MOS device physics and the findings can lead to the improvement of conventional CMOS design as well as the achievement of radiation-hardened designs."
"A new process utilizing simultaneous diffusion of Boron and Arsenic (Borsenic) from doped oxide, to fabricate high performance bipolar transistors has been developed. The doped oxide is deposited at low temperature by oxidation of SiH4, B2H6and AsH3. Since As diffuses much slower than B in Si, by heating the doped oxide at high temperatures n+-p-n structures have been obtained. By varying the time and temperature of diffusion or by varying As or B content in the oxide, we have fabricated from extremely shallow (e.g.X_{EB} \\simeq 0.3 \\micro, W_{BASE} = 0.15\\micro) to fairly deep (e.gX_{EB} \\simeq 2\\micro, W_{BASE} = 0.4\\micro) bipolar transistors. Details of the fabrication process and properties of the transistors are presented here."
"Numerous attempts have been made in recent years to improve the reliability of electronic components by taking corrective action at an early stage in the production cycle, and especially by controlling key fabrication processes. These efforts aim to correlate finished product parameters with manufacturing process steps. This paper describes some examples of high frequency Si devices whose parameter stability - one aspect of device processes. Complete diode structures and separate highly doped Si single crystal substrates with different epitaxial-, oxide-, diffusion-or ion implanted layers on them have been investigated by electron-probe and neutron-activation analysis, and by electrical tests. It has been shown that: • the precipitation of impurities, which is significantly enhanced by a code position mechanism in the presence of OH-, Cl-and S-radicals, influences the stability of breakdown voltage in epitaxial planar varactor structures; • a pronounced difference exists between the electron-beam induced currents in reliable Si diodes and those with defective high-frequency performance, and this indicates the presence of microplasma sites; • ion drift in the oxide film is a further possible cause of parameter instability. Treatments which can be applied to eliminate these unwanted instabilities are briefly mentioned."
"The application of a pulsed YAG laser beam to coding high-speed bipolar silicon integrated circuit read-only memories is discussed. Coding is accomplished by the selective vaporization of Ti-Pt links connecting the contact pads of each memory cell to Ti-Pt-Au bit lines. Vaporized link resistances of >109ohms can be consistently obtained, with no melting of the adjacent gold patterns. Parameters that have been found to be relevant to the link vaporization process are described including the number of laser pulses per link, beam spot size, thickness of the gold metallization, and pulse energy."
"A number of processing defects may produce emitter-to-collector shorts in double-diffused bipolar transistors. Photolithography errors may cause lateral shorting of adjacent emitter and collector regions; or a localized masking during base diffusion can result in the absence of a base region between emitter and collector (in a vertical direction). Surface inversion of the base region may also give rise to an electrical path between emitter and collector, although this would certainly be a rare phenomenon with the relatively high surface concentration of dopants in bipolar devices and with modern processing methods to control surface charge. Particulate contamination, especially if it contains phosphorus, can also result in localized emitter-collector shorts by overdoping the p-type base region (1). However, by far the most interesting, and the most troublesome, incidence of emitter-collector shorts is that due to \"pipes.\""
"Due to high doping effects, bipolar transistors generally show emitter efficiencies for below theoretical values. Additionally emitter base leakage currents can be high especially for double implant. ed transistors with arsenic emitter. In this paper integrated high frequency transistors (fT> 3 GHz) with improved characteristics are investigated. Discussed are emitter efficiency, current-carrying capability and emitter base characteristics, achieved by applying the polysil emitter technique and ion implantation."
"Implanted-diffused As layers in Si have been well-characterized, and have been used in fabricating low-voltage n-p junctions. It is shown that these As layers form linearly-graded junctions with a uniform B-doped background (p \\simeq .006\\Omega- cm). Further, the grade constant of the As profile at the junction is known sufficiently well as a function of As dose, diffusion time and temperature to allow quantitative use of existing tunneling and avalanche theories for the calculation of the reverse I-V curves. Calculated curves are presented which correlate As implant dose and diffusion with junction breakdown voltage, breakdown impedance and temperature coefficient of reverse voltage."
"The theory of MNOS transistors is developed in an attempt to further understand changes produced by processing variables and endurance stress tests. Since space charge within the oxide and nitride can have considerable effect on the electric fields, a space charge model is presented. Emphasis is on high field direct tunneling from an initial saturated state. The pulse write response is given in terms of observable parameters. Two new parameters are introduced: the center of charge VTCand the tunneling threshold VTT."
"Transistors were fabricated using a sputtered barium titanate dielectric for the gate insulator. The insulator shows two polarization states. It is possible to have normal field effect transistor characteristics in one state and the transistor turned off in the other state. These transistors may be useful in memory applications."
"A charge storage transistor is described which has several advantages as a non-volatile memory element over the MNOS (metal-silicon nitride-silicon dioxide-silicon) transistor. This device uses tantalum dioxide to replace silicon nitride as the second dielectric, resulting in an MTOS (metal-tantalum oxide-silicon dioxide-silicon) transistor. The obvious advantages of tantalum oxide are that its dielectric constant is larger than that of silicon nitride and that it has been widely used in the production of thin film capacitors, thereby making available a substantial amount of materials technology. The important characteristics of tantalum oxide and MTOS structures have been studied as they relate to the storage of interface charge, and results which will be presented show the potential advantages of MTOS transistors in applications as memory elements."
"An improved 1/f noise model of an MOS transistor is developed which verifies previously observed dependencies on geometry and the density of surface states (NSS) but predicts an explicit bias dependence in addition to the dependence brought out by the change of NSSwith bias. The model is an extension of the tunneling mechanism proposed by McWhorter in which carriers in the channel tunnel into and out of traps distributed in the oxide. The essential difference between this work and previous work is in the assumed transformation between the fluctuation in the number of trapped carriers and the resulting fluctuation in the drain current. The improved noise model results in the experimentally verified prediction that noise gradually decreases as the drain bias increases until saturation is reached. In addition, the improved noise model predicts a definite gate bias dependence of 1/f noise, increasing as the gate voltage decreases to threshold and below and increasing as the gate voltage increases well above threshold."
"This paper reviews reliability aspects of CW laser diodes and high radiance LED's. The most advanced of these devices are AlGaAs heterojunction structures designed for emission in the 8200- 8600 Å spectral range where most of the available fibers have the lowest transmission loss (5-10 dB/ km). In CW lasers emitted power levels to about 100 mW (from one side) have been achieved. More modest power levels are obtained from LED's (1-5 mW). Excellent progress has been made in identifying and eliminating the major failure mechanisms which plagued early devices. A major failure mode is known to be caused by certain metallurgical defects in the vicinity of the p-n junction. In addition, CW laser diodes can degrade as a result of facet damage. Both of the basic failure modes have been brought under substantial control, and stable device operation for many thousands of hours is being achieved."
"The use of light emitting diodes (LED's) in optical communications systems is critically dependent on the availability of high power single fiber compatible devices capable of sustained operation, for times in excess of 105hours. In this paper, the design and evaluation of double heterojunction Burrus(1)type GaAlAs LED's optimized for coupling to large core multimode glass fibers is described."
"Distortion measurements on a series of Burrus type germanium-doped GaAlAs double-heterostructure LED's indicate that in the investigated doping range the overall shape of the total harmonic distortion (THD) versus dc bias curve is relatively insensitive to the amount of dopant present either in the active or second confining layers. The THD figures measured at 1 KHz with 100 mA dc bias and 36 mA peak-to-peak modulation currents were in the range of 42 to 44 dB down on the fundamental. The results of temperature measurements show that with increasing temperature the THD increases; at 100mA dc bias, the increase is linear with a slope of approximately 0.06 dB/°C."
"This paper describes the characteristics of double-heterojunction GaAs/(AlGa)As laser diodes with the lowest room temperature threshold current density (475 A/cm2) yet reported and a very small temperature sensitivity. The CW output from such lasers is only halved between 22 and 80°C at constant current."
"A new type of internally striped planar (ISP) DH lasers is developed with using a new Sulfur selective diffusion technique. The increase of the threshold ratio with the narrowing of the stripe width is more gentle for stripe width range near 10 µm in the laser than in both Zn-diffused planar and proton-bombardment stripe-geometry lasers. Single transverse mode operation with nearly constant width is confirmed up to 100 °C and up to three times of a threshold. Room-temperature CW lasers stably operate over more than 3000 hours. Any deterioration of laser characteristics caused by S atom and its diffusion process is not observed. Sulfur selective diffusion is one of most promising technique for long life lasers and other devices."
"The author provides a thumbnail sketch of the historical development of infrared detectors and related technology. IR detectors are characterized by the shape of their spectral response, their speed of response and the detectivity at a particular wavelength, usually at the spectral peak. In addition, such data as temperature of operation, magnitude and frequency dependance of detector noise, detector impedance, angular field of view and detector area may distinguish one type of detector from another and even detectors of the same type. Detectors may be placed into two categories with vastly different properties: Thermal and Photon detectors. Thermal detectors have been in use since the early 1800's. "
"Use of CCD and CID technology at or near the focal plane for multiplexing and signal processing will make practical IR focal planes with thousands of detectors. Two approaches to series-parallel scan appear interesting: a sandwich like structure which uses direct injection from the IR detectors into a CCD TDI register and the use of an IR CID for premultiplexing in a series-parallel scan mode."
"Data on lifetime, responsivity, noise and detectivity has been obtained on discrete Si:Ga infrared detectors as a function of temperature (5K - 35K), background photon flux density (\\phi_{B}- 10^{13}-10^{17}photons/cm2-sec) and bias field (E = 200-1200 v/cm). Several detectors with differing boron impurities and compensation were evaluated. The effects of compensation on the amplitude of the photoconductive lifetime, responsivity and noise is demonstrated with experimental data. From the data, the quantum efficiency of the detectors is shown to vary from 0. 25 to 0.4. A theoretical model has been developed to explain the observed behavior of the lifetime, signal, noise and detectivity. The model is based on solving the rate equations for the excess carriers for a three impurity level model (i. e. , phosphorus, boron and gallium levels). The theory is compared with the experimental data obtained on the detectors showing correlation. Impulse response data on the Si:Ga detectors was obtained using a PbSnTe laser."
"We undertook a study of resistivity inhomogeneity in semiconductors containing deep impurities to determine (i) its influence in techniques used to characterize such materials, and (ii) what sample preparation and operating conditions minimize inhomogeneity and/or its effect. Zinc-compensated silicon was used as a specific example in both the calculations and the measurements. Several important results are presented which not only demonstrate the pitfalls of neglecting inhomogeneity in materials research, but also propose methods of coping with it."
"Experimental results are presented on the operation of gold-, indium-, and gallium-doped silicon MOSFET's as infrared photon detectors (IRFET's) [1]. Photoionization of these impurity centers in the surface space charge depletion region of the MOSFET causes a modulation in the threshold voltage and the conductivity of the MOSFET. Previous results on gold-doped devices [2,3] have been extended to indium-doped devices [4] and preliminary results obtained on gallium-doped devices. The IRFET exhibits large gains and responsivities of 1.0 milliamp/microwatt (10 milliwatts/microjoule) are easily achieved with indium-doped devices. It is shown that shot noise or background limited rather than 1/f noise limited operation can be achieved. By the use of these three dopants, the near, middle, and far infrared wavelength regions can be covered."
"A closed-form solution to the heat conduction equation was derived which treats all pertinent details of detector construction. This solution is used to calculate the recovery of the detector voltage following the laser pulse using measured values of the detector resistance as a function of temperature. The thermal conductances of the two bonding layers can be determined empirically by fitting the model to the experimental thermal recovery data."
"Strong electron emission is reported from patterned thin films of tin-indium oxide and preliminary studies of this phenomenon are presented. The pattern, etched in the sputtered films using standard photolithographic techniques, is an \"H\" or \"dumbbell\" shape with a narrow crossbar. With crossbars 0.1 mm wide, in excess of 1.5 mA of emission current is typically seen with a current of 15 mA through the sample and 300 V on a collector 2 cm from the sample. The emitters are physically rugged and are not damaged by operation in a vacuum as poor as 10-5Torr."
"Oxidation and reduction experiments have been done on oxide coated cathodes, using a number of gases commonly occurring in vacuum devices, notably CH4, H2, H2O, CO, CO2, and O2. The results are interpreted in terms of a chemical model of the cathode, which results in reaction probabilities; for the oxidizing gases, these are normalized to the reaction probability of Mg from the core. It is shown that this probability is near unity when the coating is subjected to external oxidizing influences. The reaction probabilities found in this way are O2:1 , CO2:O216 H2O: 0,009. For the reducing gases the reaction probabilities are, in principle, absolute; H2O 5.10-6, CO:2.10-6, CH4=3, 6.10-6With CH4two stages can be discerned: first, cracking at the cathode surface with the probability mentioned; second, reaction of the resulting carbon with the coating with a maximum rate of about 1.1013atoms cm-2. s-1. This interpretation is backed by an experiment in which the cathode was bombarded with argon and methane ions."
"Auger spectroscopy, work function measurements, and residual gas analysis are the techniques used in this study of an active cathode operated at nominal values of emission and temperature. The surface properties of conventional impregnated cathodes are investigated by the use of Auger spectroscopy and work function measurements, and these are compared with a synthesized barium or barium oxide coated tungsten surface. The latter surface is prepared by evaporating barium from a KIC barium getter in an ultra high vacuum system on to a tungsten surface which can be heated to elevated temperatures. Multilayer or monolayer coverages can be investigated using this technique. The results of these measurements show the surface of an impregnated tungsten cathode is identical to that observed for a synthesized monolayer of barium on tungsten, using the criteria of identical Auger patterns and work functions."
"Geometrical enlargement radiography for observing the fine details of an object for diagnosis requires an extremely small X-ray source. Such an X-ray source in an X-ray tube must make use of a very narrow electron beam. Conventional X-ray tubes have coiled filaments for electron emitter and electro-static focusing electrodes, all of which are at the same potential. It is difficult to focus the electron beam compared with other electron guns like TWT. We have not had X-ray tubes with a focused electron beam less than 0.2 mm. We have developed the 50 µm micro-focus X-ray tube utilizing computer aided design technique to obtain electron beam trajectries. The space charge effect was taken advantage of in the design. The diameter of the coiled filament for the electron emitter is 0.56 mm and the width of the focused electron beam is approximately 50 µm."
"This paper reports life test data on the highest CW power EBS device demonstrated to date. A silicon EBS diode of 60 mm2active area, but with only 10 mm2under electron bombardment, mounted on a water-cooled heatsink, was operated at 200 to 250 W dissipation for 5000 hours. During this period, reverse leakage characteristics were stable but current gain declined in the first 1000 hours. From 5000 to 8000 hours, dissipation was raised to 300 W with a junction temperature which ultimately proved to be over 200°C. Leakage current increased substantially during this period. Cathode deterioration forced a reduction of power to 250 W after 8000 hours. The diode was short-circuited after 9360 hours by the growth of a crystalline projection outside the area of bombardment. Prior to the beginning of the life test, the diode temperature was measured in EBS operation by an infrared pyrometer technique. A theoretical prediction of CW performance for EBS amplifiers is also given."
"The development of a wideband deflection modulated EBS amplifier is described. The device uses an electron beam of rectangular cross section which is modulated by a traveling wave deflector and bombards a pair of reverse biased, silicon diodes to provide a balanced, class A, push-pull output. A linear transfer characteristic is obtained by adjustment of the beam current density profile. With a 100 ohm load per side the device has a signal voltage gain of 40 and gives a linear output of 8 V with a risetime of 220 ps (1.6 GHz bandwidth)."
"Through the application of diffused MOS (DMOS) transistors to the design of complementary MOS circuits, a CMOS process that is simpler and denser than that presently used has been designed and demonstrated. Test circuits using 1 ohm. cm n-type"
"Depletion-mode load devices can be integrated with DMOS transistors without any extra diffusions or ion implantation processing steps by judicious choice of the substrate crystal orientation and resistivity. For low voltage operation, (1,1,1) crystal orientation also yields a higher transconductance for the DMOS transistor than the (1, 0, 0) orientation. The geometry of the load device and the DMOS transistor can be made ratioless to conserve area. Self-aligned gates, hitherto considered incompatible with DMOS transistors, has been incorporated in the structure. The experimental DMOS inverters, using a conservative design, have achieved 4 ns propagation delay, 1.3V operation and 2 pJ propagation delay-power dissipation product."
"A one-dimensional model has been developed to study the breakdown voltage behavior of an n-channel IGFET in a conventional CMOS integrated circuit. Two parasitic npn bipolar transistors intrinsic to the circuit which shunt the IGFET are found to limit the breakdown voltage below the intrinsic value of the drain/p-tub junction. Turn-on of the parasitics occurs as a result of hole avalanche current flowing in the p-tub at low-level multiplication. Semiquantitative agreement with experimental results is obtained using one adjustable parameter. The model has been used to show how lowering the resistance between the p-tub contact and the n-channel drain reduces the effect of the vertical parasitic. Reduction of the breakdown voltage with reduced channel length has been calculated, as well as the way in which lowered p-tub doping can be used to increase the operating voltage."
"A novel structure, Vertical Injection Logic (VIL) is proposed for getting a superior power-delay product. VIL has a device structure in which PNP transistor is arranged vertically below NPN transistor to obtain the narrow base width by two diffusion steps. The current gain of the PNP device described increases to almost 0.9 in comparison with 0.4 of the usual one. The experimental results show a minimum stage delay of 8.8 ns and a power-delay product of 0.07 pJ compared to 37 ns and 0.3 pJ for the usual I2L device."
"Gold diffusion transistor logic (GTL) has been defined and fabricated as it will be useful for both high speed and low power bipolar LSI logic circuits. GTL is composed of nearly intrinsic high resistor and n-p-n transistors with conventional gold diffusion. Each component of GTL is self isolated with the foregoing gold diffusion without any special isolation. Speed-power products of 1.5 pJ per gate have been measured in 4-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and packing densities of 150 gates/mm2have been achieved. A performance comparison with integrated injection logic (IIL) will be presented."
"A simple model of non-volatile MOS memory (NVM) devices with dual dielectric layers is presented. Conduction through the dielectric layers is described by a dielectric resistivity ρ. Empirical relations for ρ are approximated by simple exponential dependences on electric field, E, for the dielectric materials of interest (SiO2, Si3N4, Al2O3) This procedure leads to further simplifications for threshold voltage shifts during write/erase operations, without introducing any adjustable parameters. Agreement with experimental data is favorable. A wide variety of NVM structures can be modelled, simply by varying two technology parameters, β1and β2. This model is well-suited to facilitate computer-aided-design (CAD) of NVM devices and circuits."
"A three-dimensional mathematical model is described which approximates the nonlinear lateral thermal feedback mechanisms producing hot spot formation in power transistors. The model satisfactorily predicts many features of the hot spot phenomenon which are observed experimentally. Providing a capability for assessing the merits of various emitter stripe configurations, as well as two forms of emitter ballasting, it represents a first step toward the achievement of a computer-aided engineering tool for power transistor design."
"The IDS-VGScharacteristics of a narrow width MOS device-fabricated with self-aligned field implanted technology is markedly different from that predicted by the conventional theory. It has been observed that the threshold voltage and electrical channel width are functions of both gate bias and geometrical width. An explanation of this observation is given. The concepts of the effective threshold voltage and the effective channel width for a non-uniformly doped device are introduced, and a simple model developed which enables the determination of the doping profile along the channel width from a known IDS-VGSrelationship. In addition, a technique is described which enables an automatic plot of doping profile along the channel width, a technique which should prove invaluable for process control."
"This paper presents a theoretical and experimental study on the isolation junction characteristics of bipolar transistors fabricated with combined oxide and diffused isolation structures. Using a quasi two-dimensional approach, the junction capacitance and junction breakdown voltage are computed as functions of device design parameters such as impurity concentration profiles and spacing between the diffusion window edges. Threshold voltage of surface inversion is also computed by taking into account the non-uniformity of the boron profiles and the boron depletion effect. Advantages and disadvantages of forming an N channel stop by reach-up and reach-down boron diffusions are compared. Experimental results are included to substantiate the theoretical results."
"When implanted boron is used as a replacement for a chemically predeposited base on silicon and driven-in in an oxidizing ambient, the gain (hFE) of the transistor is lower for a given base charge, Qb, and the emitter-base junction is leaky. A simple process which results in excellent junctions and transistor gain has been developed, featuring implantation into bare Si and a one-step anneal-diffusion drive-in in a\\lsim 0.1% O2ambient. A comparative study of transistor properties was made for different processing: implanting into bare silicon and through oxides, and doing drive-in diffusions in various ambients from \"no oxygen\" (N2) to 100% O2. The reduced gain for the high percentage O2ambient is interpreted in terms of enhanced recombination near stacking fault-like defects in the emitter-base space charge region. For the low-percentage O2ambient the median standard deviation of the base sheet resistance improved from 7% (diffused) to 2% (implanted) and the median standard deviation of the hFEimproved from 19% to 15%."
"The production of high quality n-type ion implanted layers suitable for GaAs MESFET device fabrication has been accomplished. The layers produced by implantation into low doped LPE layers are superior to those produced by implantation into semi-insulating substrates. The doping efficiency of the implanted and annealed layers increases with sample temperature during the implants reaching 85% for moderate dose implants of S at 500°C for layers annealed at 900°C. Annealing the implanted layers at 900°C for 15 minutes with a CVD Si3N4protective layer produces n-type layers with Hall mobilities of 4500 cm2V-1s-1for Te and 5000 cm2V-1s-1for S implants at peak concentrations of 1017cm-3."
"Measurements are described on a complete 1.06µ optical receiver which gives subnanosecond light pulse response and has a sensitivity, even without avalanche gain, of 375 photons/pulse (for a peak signal to rms noise ratio of unity; this figure is proportionately improved with avalanche gain). This receiver utilizes a new inverted homo-heterostructure GaAs1-xSbxavalanche photodiode which has a 1.06µ quantum efficiency of 96% and junction capacitance of about 0.1pf, hybrid-integrated with a special feedback-mode (transimpedance-type) GAASFET preamp with an input capacitance of 0.28pf and a feedback resistance of 5000Ω. The receiver is capable of modelocked pulse data reception up to a 1.4 Gb/s data rate (before intersymbol interference becomes excessive)."
"This paper describes a new type of reach through silicon avalanche photodiode having a special impurity profile in the multiplying region. A low-high-low structure is proposed in which generation and multiplication regions are separated. So, a finite avalanche width where the electric field is nearly constant is obtained by a buried P type layer. This new structure allows high multiplication factor with lower avalanche field than in N+P π P+diodes."
"Applications of integrated optical devices to optical communications or signal processing often involve light beam deflection or spatial Fourier transformation performed by optical waveguide lenses. In each of these processes information carried by the light beam can be converted to an electrical signal through use of a detector array. By integrating a detector array into an optical waveguide structure, optical scattering which would occur in coupling light out of the waveguide and into a detector array is eliminated so that the primary limitation on information capacity is the detector array resolution. We consider herein such an integrated optical waveguide detector array which uses silicon as the substrate. The use of silicon allows fabrication of CCD array scanning structures or other array addressing circuitry, signal enhancement circuitry, and signal processing circuitry on the same substrate as the optical waveguide. A silicon substrate is also advantageous for optical waveguide formation in that the thermallygrown Si02 layer which supports the thin-film optical waveguide has a low refractive index and a very smooth surface for waveguide deposition. Also, Si is well-suited for the formation of three-dimensional channel waveguides by preferential etching."
"Preferentially etched waveguides in Si grooves have a surface smoothness associated with the crystalline planes. The surface scattering loss can be minimized. The low index of refraction of the Si02 buffering layer permits an easier choice of waveguide materials. The input/output coupling surfaces simplify the coupling problems. The density of channel waveguides is limited both by photolithographic techniques and by throughput requirements. Waveguides with a 12.5 μm width and spacing can be fabricated with reasonable throughput. This gives more than 1000 channel waveguides in an inch."
"Cd-diffused Pb1-xSnxTe diode lasers have been fabricated with cw output powers of 1.25 mW (single-mode) and 2.4 mW (total) at 10.6 µm. These power levels are attributed to: the low-temperature Cd-diffusion, a new method of growing low dislocation density crystals and to contact resistance as low as3\\times10^{-5}-cm2. For the first time in Pb1-xSnxTe homojunction lasers the onset of lasing was observed in diode I-V measurements. Multi-mode emission spectra are common for cw operation, but reducing the cavity width encourages single-mode emission, indicating the filamentary nature of modes in these devices."
"A single longitudinal and transverse mode Nd:YAG laser is described. The unique feature of this laser is the rapid build up time of the output pulse which appears 125 nsec after application of either an optical or electronic trigger pulse, with a jitter of ± 10 nsec. The output is further shuttered to a rectangular pulse of from 1 to 10 nsec duration. Single mode operation is obtained with a two element resonant reflector and a birefringent Lyot filter of calcite. To further aid in frequency selection, the cavity Q is not completely spoiled to allow buildup of quasi-monochromatic radiation before the cavity is switched to high Q. Problems of frequency selection and cavity stability are discussed."
"The description of a method of generating optical-frequency-sensitive signals in single mode lasers is presented in this paper. The technique involves the coupling of energy from the mode having gain to the other, non-oscillating modes. The theory which applies to this work was obtained starting from the coupled mode equations of Harris and McDuff. The experiments were performed using a multimode HeNe laser by applying phase modulation at a frequency which coupled longitudinal cavity modes greater than one doppler linewidth apart. The results were found to compare favorably with the theory."
"The use of the acousto-optical interaction between guided optical waves and surface acoustic waves to make an efficient high resolution light deflector is discussed. Details of a device with a 150MHz bandwidth and 125 experimentally observed spots and using a novel acoustic transducer, are given."
"This work demonstrates that useful signal processing devices can be obtained by combining the process of thin film piezoelectric transducer fabrication with large scale MOS integrated circuit technology. Increased amounts of signal processing capability should be obtainable on single chip structures by making greater use of LSI IC (integrated circuit) technology, and resultant cost savings and reliability improvements should be realizable over functionally comparable hybrid devices."
"Enhancement mode GaAs junction field-effect transistors have been explored in their application to digital and linear integrated circuit design. A 3-input NAND-gate and a one stage differential amplifier have been fabricated in integrated form on a 30 × 30 mil2chip. The electrical performance characteristics will be described. With a 4 micron gate length the monolithically integrated 3- input NAND-gate has a propagation delay time of 1 ns with a power dissipation of 2mW per gate, i.e., speed-power product of 2 pJ. The differential amplifier has a response time of 2 ns and flat frequency response to about 150 MHz. GaAs enhancement (normally-off) JFET integrated circuits offer better speed-power products than CMOS or Schottky-clamped bipolar ones at operating frequencies of 1 MHz and above. Optimized devices are capable of operating with a speed-power product of 1-2 pJ in the subnano-second switching range. The temperature range from 2°K to 650°K (or 380°C) for GaAs JFET's encompasses applications which are not possible with silicon devices GaAs JFET's and IC's are superior to Si devices and IC's in gamma and neutron environments and offer a potential design in radiation hardened integrated electronics."
"The objective of this investigation was to fabricate various types of enhancement mode GaAs junction field-effect transistors (JFET) utilising ion implantation and to explore their electrical characteristics. A promising application of enhancement mode GaAs JFET's to high speed, low power, radiation hardened integrated circuits has been established (1). Although the present ion implanted devices are not optimised with respect to electrical performance, it is demonstrated that ion implantation can replace epitaxy and diffusion of the standard fabrication technique. Inherent to ion implantation is precise control of impurity concentration, depth and profile, thus leading to integrated circuit fabrication with improved yield figures over large wafer areas."
"This paper describes the design, fabrication and characteristics of a new device capable of switching large microwave power at extremely low drive power levels. The new device is a novel resistor-insulator-semiconductor (RIS) structure which switches a microwave signal between two terminals by the application of a D.C. bias on a third, or control, terminal. The device embodies several unique features including the use of resistive titanium dioxide as a gate electrode and the use of an insulating TiO2/ SiO2composite dielectric as the gate insulator. The device has exhibited a diode OFF/ON ratio in excess of 1500, an insertion loss of 1.2 dB and has switched 100 watts of Rf power at a control level of less than 1µwatt in a 3.5 GHz 4-bit phase shifter."
"It is shown that hydrogen in the ambient atmosphere changes the flatband voltage of palladium gate MOS-structures. The physical mechanisms behind this phenomenon are discussed. Experimental results on the detection of hydrogen in air, argon and nitrogen are given. It is shown that the rate constants of chemical reactions on the Pd-surface are obtained from such experiments. The detection of hydrogen in hydrogen compounds like ammonia and of hydrogen in smoke is also demonstrated. Internal photoemission experiments, which support the results on the flatband voltage changes of MOS-structures, are briefly discussed."
"The model equations for the response of MOSFET, Schottky barrier and heterojunction diodes to chemical stimuli are derived. It is shown that diode structures have intrinsic advantages over MOSFET's because of the form of the response relations."

The new device is analogous to the self mode-locked microwave oscillator described by Cutler in 1955 and the mode-locked lasersintroduced by Hargrove, et al. in 1964 and by DeMaria, et al. in 1967. In operation, the multiple modes of oscillation, spaced by the reciprocal of the decay time and usually deemed undesirable, are synchronized by inserting a nonlinear element, a signal e~ander, into the feedback loop. The synchronized spectral lines, whose number are governed by the bandwidth of the SAW transducers, combine to form a precise train of short rf pulses~with a repetition rate equal to the reciprocal of the delay time. Furthermore, the rf frequency is a precise harmonic of the pulse repetition rate. The precision, highly synchronized, comb spectrum is a feature which could prove important for frequency synthesis in programmable frequency hopping systems. Experiments with mode-locked oscillators operating near 100 MHz with 50 ns pulse widths, 0.56 MHz repetition rates and comb spectrums spanning more than 20 MHz are described."

     "Both diffraction and dispersion degrade the signal processing fidelity of acoustic surface wave (ASW) convolvers. It is shown that both effects can be simulated on a model convolver by means of linear passive pre or post-distortion filters. In practice, a degree of compensation can be achieved by using inverse networks. Emphasis is placed on deriving design formulas that allow distortion levels to be estimated without extensive computation. Distortion network characteristics required are related to convolver layout. A number of typical design examples are considered."

"A two dimensional solution for the vector potential and eddy current loss in a plurality of conducting regions due to a plurality of current sources is presented. The solution is applicable to those problems with boundaries which may be aligned with the coordinate surfaces of an orthogonal system of separable coordinates. The vector potential solution and current sources are represented by a series of eigenfunctions and the boundary conditions for the fields are applied such that numerical techniques can be used in solving for the coefficients of the series solution and then the eddy current losses. The method is applied to the problem of currents parallel to conducting plates in rectangular coordinates and the results are compared to those of previous investigations."
"Design details and performance testing of a high speed linear induction motor and test facility are described. The motor is double sided and of sector shape with radial slots. It has 4 poles, is 3 feet in length and is loaded by reaction with an 80 inch diameter rotating disc facility. Performance testing including efficiency, power factor, thrust, and normal force and moment are reported for operation over a speed range up to 300 MPH. A breakdown of losses, including end effects, and measurements of air gap flux density over the length of the motor are also reported. A description of instrumentation, the data Acquisition system and the load loop is given. The results are expected to be used to increase the understanding of LIM behavior and design and to provide a data base for the verification of new designs and new theoretical models."
"This paper presents a generalized analysis for an n-m phase salient-pole electrical machine. The mathematical models of this machine are formulated in the symmetrical components, the two-phase, and the d-q reference frame. Regardless of the number of phases, it is found that the analysis of such a machine is remarkably simplified through its replacement by an equivalent two-phase commutator machine. The paper also presents a sound per-unit system suitable for the transformations used. In addition, the case of a 6- phase salient-pole synchronous generator is considered as a specific practical application of this generalized analysis."
"Standard Reliability analysis techniques have demonstrated the capability to evaluate system vulnerability to random component failures. Recently, in the nuclear power industry, interest has been developing in methods to consider systematic, nonrandom, so-called \"Common-mode\" failures which are not tractable in quantitative terms using the usual fault tree or reliability block diagram approaches. This paper summarizes the state of the art as reliability engineers seek to extend the techniques to include multiple failures from a common cause (or in a common mode). Qualitative extensions of both the fault tree and the reliability block diagrams have been used to evaluate the adequacy of reactor protection circuitry for commercial power reactors."
"A technique is presented for calculating the approximate total sound power level (PWL) of large steam turbine-generators as well as the PWL of individual turbine-generator components. A near field approximation is used which is similar in structure to the new IEEE test code 85. Modifications are introduced in the test code procedure to reduce the effect of component flanking noise, and noise contributed by extraneous sources. The overall turbine room PWL is also calculated by a reverberant field technique and compared to PWL as calculated by free field methods. Measurements were made around ten large steam turbine generator units ranging in name plate rating from 390 to 1050 MVA. PWL's of turbine-generators were found to increase by approximately 3.5db for each doubling of unit rated MVA. PWL's calculated from indoor near field approximation show a 3 dbA increase over PWL's of outdoor units of equivalent rating. This difference is an indication of the need for further development of methods for determining sound power level."
"Upon the successful development and laboratory testing of the EHV current transducer as described in a companion paper, the design was deemed satisfactory and ready for extensive field evaluation.

"In the Dossenwald test station, near Mannheim, an insulator testfield for more than 30 test objects was constructed, fed by a stiff d.c. voltage source and controlled by an automatic test program installation. The tested types, 7 post insulators (porcelain) and 3 suspension insulators (porcelain, glass, silicone rubber), two specimen of each type in parallel, were continuously under 400 kV d.c. voltage, positive polarity, for more than 8000 h. Flashovers during that time were analysed."
"Cable pairs entering power stations may be subjected to ground potential rise (GPR) and/or induction of several thousand volts during power system faults. A cable protection system designed to give a high degree of reliability is described, and the results of staged fault and laboratory tests are discussed. An analysis of neutralizing transformer transient performance shows how the transformer's behavior during fault conditions is determined by its volt-time capability."

A guide to evaluate the importance of different variables influencing insulation strength and their impact on line insulation design is reviewed, and curves showing the line flashover rate for different insulation characteristics are presented."
"This paper deals with system testing of dielectrics and their relation to power-factor-correction capacitors. The interaction of the various components in an electrical system are complex and extremely difficult to evaluate using ordinary analytical techniques. The major problems associated with analytical methods are overcome by using the systems approach. Evaluations which have been conducted with systems have yielded design information, processing data, and reliability characteristics which have previously been unobtainable even with large capacitors."
"Calculations of electrodynamic forces of conducting sheet suspensions for preliminary design studies of magnetically levitated high speed guided ground transport have usually considered sheets of infinite width. Economic considerations necessitate a limited sheet width, and to the designer a knowledge of the effect of finite width on suspension forces becomes important. Edge effects of sheet guideways are studied here by boundary matching of the three-dimensional magnetic fields to the guideway current modes and to the current excitations in the flat rectangular superconducting coils. The double Fourier series approach is used. Theoretical predictions correlate with experimental measurements simulating the high speed limit of the suspension. Design guidelines are given."
 "An experimental analysis of a fast electromagnetic circuit breaker driving mechanism has been performed. The device utilizes the repulsion force produced on a metal disc subjected to a transient magnetic field The spatial distribution, in the disc, of the driving field was determined using magnetic probes located at the surface of the disc or imbedded within. The acceleration of the disc was also measured using a piezo-electric aceelerometer. A pulsed power supply circuit with or without crow-bar energizes the magnet coil. The experimental results are found to agree very well with a more refined theoretical analysis presented in this paper. Some recommendations are made with regard to the optimization of both the geometry of the driving mechanism and the characteristics of the power supply used to energize this driving mechanism."
"The activities of nuclear power plant designers are monitored by government and industry to an unprecendented degree. This involves not only rigid design and quality assurance criteria, but extensive documentation and reporting. The failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) is a technique for checking designs and assuring quality. Included in the FMEA is a system of documentation. A simplified example of the reactor protective system (RPS) is used to illustrate the method."
"A very fast method to calculate maximum gradients for the center-phase of a bundle-conductor line in flat arrangement has been given in a previous paper. The present contribution extends this method for the calculation of the maximum gradient of a side phase, again for bundles with any number of subconductors."
"V-t characteristic of impulse and switching surge breakdown in SF6is studied on various gaps. The characteristic is categorized into three patterns depending on the configuration of the gap and gas pressure. The properties of the V-t characteristic in these patterns are generalized as a semi-empirical formula which will be useful in the quantitative evaluation of the insulation coordination and the abnormal voltage protection of SF6gas insulated power equipments. The gap conditions in which those patterns of V-t characteristic are observed are also discussed in the Appendices."
"Since engineers learned, about 50 years ago, that a current transformer has real difficulty with an initially fully offset transient current, they have written many papers about the difficulty without finding a solution for most practical relay problems. This paper offers new data and methods which are intended to lead the relay engineer to solutions to many problems and to give him a better insight toward proper action in cases where there is still no simple solution. The emphasis is on practical problem solving. Some of the assumptions which are made can be defended on the basis that the solution, however much in error, errs on the safe side, and that the solution is a most valuable guide to the relay engineer."
"General modeling criteria are presented for constructing liquid metal analogs for conducting paths in electrical machines. The use of mercury is specifically discussed as a convenient analog for solid copper and aluminum secondaries, and molten metal in electric furnaces. The construction of probes to measure flux and current density is presented, as are applications of the technique to bus bars, linear induction motors, and channel furnaces."
"Single flow-rate-dependent sites of water emission and corona discharge are experimentally investigated with the dual objectives of furthering the understanding of audible noise generation from high-voltage transmission lines in foul weather, and engineering electrically-driven sources of charged droplets for use in particulate pollution control devices. Three distinct modes of behavior are mapped as functions of flow rate and potential gradient for ac and dc excitations of both polarities. Each is characterized in terms of physical appearance, current, visual corona, and nature of audible noise. Detailed treatment is given to the high-flow-rate, high-gradient mode which consists of an electrohydrodynamic jet terminated in a corona discharge followed by a spray of charged droplets. In terms of noise generated, this mode is efficient in removing water from a high-voltage transmission line. It appears also to be practical as a source of charged droplets. The salient features of this mode are given a basic explanation by using an experiment to control the potential distribution around the site in such a way that the electrohydrodynamics of the jet formation, as well as the electrical discharge, can be quantitatively described. For the first time, the corona discharge is identified as a trigger mechanism for breakup of a current-driven jet. Estimates are given of the drop size and charge, and the electrical power requirement for atomization from an array of sites."
"This paper utilizes data from the PEEC 1971-72 Survey and other related information to demonstrate a feasible system of criteria for identifying schools which have developed substantial electric power engineering programs. Recommendations are made for refining and extending the concept to establish an official list of outstanding electric power engineering curricula. A proposal is also made that the Power Engineering Education Committee of the Power Engineering Society should establish a sub-committee to periodically name a limited number of schools which have developed outstanding power programs."
"The long-range plans of the Long Island Lighting Company include the installation of 4600 MW of generation capacity at nuclear sites on eastern Long Island by the 1990's. A single site, Shoreham, was chosen for this study which would require transmission facilities to the Ruland Road substation, 43 miles away. Conventional 345 kV overhead and underground circuits are planned for this service. For the case study three superconducting cable schemes have been investigated which reflect various technical options. The superconducting cables have been designed to meet acceptable normal and contingency load flow conditions and to withstand maximum short circuit faults. A cost analysis has been made of the complete installation, providing a valuable comparison of the estimated cost of this new technology with conventional methods. The most favorable cost comparison is a two-circuit 345 kV superconducting system, which appears to be about one-half the cost of an all underground 345 kV high pressure oil-filled cable system. No reactive compensation will be required for the superconducting system, whereas extensive compensation is required for HPOF cables over the same distance. The cost estimate for the two-circuit superconducting system is about twice that of 345 kV overhead transmission, which would consist of two double circuits and one single circuit, assuming right-of-way could be obtained."

"A systematic approach based on linear graph theory is suggested for linear and non-linear state model formulation of a system comprising of a dual-excited synchronous generator, connected to an infinite bus through a transmission line, and controlled by voltage regulator, angle regulator and a speed governor. Viewing the system as an interconnection of five simple subsystems, each being represented in isolation by a directed terminal graph and a set of terminal equations, leads to the generation of a system graph. A minimal state characterization is easily obtained through selecting a maximal forest, getting constraint equations therefrom, and substituting them in suitably arranged terminal equations. The method is applicable in general for any complex system. Besides presenting some of the computed results from the model thus formulated, for comparison with the experimental data available in the literature, investigations in this paper are further directed towards studies aimed at improving the stability regions to their maximum limit and cutting down the rotor copper losses to a minimum level. The effect of system operation in these modes on the relative choice of the three controller parameters is discussed with the help of various parameter-plane stability-limit loci plots."
"High voltage switching impulses may be generated from cascaded testing transformers by suddenly energizing the transformers for a short period of time. A detailed analysis of this high voltage impulse generation technique was made and its practical feasibility was tested on three transformer units in cascade. A series of generalized curves correlating the basic characteristics of the output impulse with the circuit components was derived for a rapid selection of the optimum operating conditions of any given test circuit."
"Some of the test results measured during short circuit tests on a full size, 19.5 MVA, three phase, three winding, oil filled, power transformer are reported and analyzed in this paper. Included are radial flux measurements to obtain accurate calculated electromagnetic forces, the effects of tap configuration and clamping force on the dynamic forces transmitted to various parts of the transformer structure, comparison of the measured results with computer predicted results, the circumferential force variation at the top of the winding, the forces experienced by the tie plates, and the failure detection results."
"New techniques were applied to the analysis of spontaneous power oscillations that occur in the Mid-Continent Area Power Pool (MAPP). System natural frequencies below one hertz were calculated along with the relative velocity deviations of major generating units at each frequency. Operating data was used to determine which of these low natural frequencies correspond to system oscillations. Simulation of the spontaneous oscillation was obtained using a dynamic stability program by giving each generator an initial velocity deviation proportional to the previously calculated relative velocity deviations for that frequency. The oscillation was also obtained by suddenly dropping load in one area of the dynamic model and picking it up in another area. A number of simulations were carried out to about twenty seconds or approximately three cycles of the natural frequency to investigate dynamic stability limits under various conditions. Quantitative calculations of synchronizing power flow capability between areas were used to evaluate the effects of operating and design changes."
"Chlorinated polyethylene has some unusual properties which have led to its use in specialized cable applications. In one of the more interesting of these, it serves as the base resin for resistive compounds for use as adherent screens to the insulation of \"solid dielectric\" high voltage cables. Specifically, it has led to the adoption of a new class of resistive compound, termed DRT, in which the mechanical characteristics at high temperatures lie intermediate between those of conventional thermoplastic and crosslinked compounds. This paper describes the range of chlorinated polyethylene resins best suited to this application and discusses the influence of various parameters on the characteristics of practical compounds. Reference is made to some experience in the commercial use of these compounds."
"A power system of n generators has n-1 normal modes of oscillation. If any of these modes is poorly damped, persistent or disruptive oscillations may occur. Knowledge of the normal modes and mode shapes of a specific system provides important insight into its dynamic behavior. Calculation of normal modes and mode shapes yields data that permits a systematic approach to dynamic stability Studies. The theoretical basis for normal mode analysis of power systems is presented. Methods for calculating normal modes and mode shapes are described, with illustrations to small systems. Techniques for simulating normal modes for the analysis of mode damping are shown. A companion paper describes the application of modal analysis to a large area in the MAPP system."
"The problem discussed in this paper is the planning of distribution substation locations, sizes, and service boundaries. The technique discussed uses operations research methods to simultaneously optimize substation sizes and service boundaries, given alternative locations for the substations and reliability constraints. The results of the discussed techniques will lead to a configuration of substations that will minimize distribution feeder losses and substation construction costs. Adherence to the results will lower long-range distribution expenses."
"The differential equations describing a frequency transient are solved in the Laplace domain: a numerical inverse transformation method is used in conjunction with an iterative technique to account for system nonlinearities. This method has the advantage of \"filtering out\" synchronizing oscillations between individual machines, thus speeding up the solution process. If a complete numerical integration time-domain solution is needed the S-domain method can be used to 1) assess directly the sensitivity of the solution to changes in the model, thus enabling model reduction. 2) determine regions with common average frequency."
"The paper extends the method of recursive convolutions for the calculation of electro-magnetic transients on transmission lines with ground return to discretely transposed lines and double circuit lines. A review of the recursive convolution method is first given, completed with a starting procedure for the calculation of transients from a known steady state. Effects of transpositions, such as mode reflections and mode conversion, are then discussed. For double circuit lines, it is shown that they can be represented as two equivalent single circuit lines, thus making possible the use of most simple subroutines for line response calculations."
"The authors have developed a computer program which calculates the potential in earth, the resistance and the required potential probe position in field resistance measurements [1], for any complex electrode in a two layer earth structure. The first part of the study describes the theoretical basis of the programs and compares the two analytical methods of potential calculations, the summation and the integration methods. The second part contains essentially a comparison between the theoretical calculations derived in this paper, experimental results obtained in scaled down model [2], and other theoretical calculations currently used in the industry [3]. The final part will discuss the efficiency of different usual electrode configurations and will introduce new configurations."
"In a previous paper [1] the authors have presented the theoretical basis of their computer program which calculates grounding electrode performance. This paper compares experimental results obtained in a scaled down two layer earth model [2] with the analytical results for different forms of usual ground electrodes, it compares also the authors method with the conventional methods used currently in the industry."
"In a previous paper [1] the authors have presented the theoretical basis of their computer program which determines grounding electrodes performance. In this last paper of the series presented, a detailed study of the influence of electrodes and earth parameters on grounding performance is analysed for different types of practical electrodes. A brief analysis and discussion of new electrodes configuration is also included."
"The problem of estimating the admittance parameters of an external equivalent network using internal system operating data is considered. By utilizing information available from monitoring scheduled or forced internal system outages, together with static state estimator data, external network equivalents can be estimated. The algorithm for performing this type of parameter estimation is derived. Its effectiveness and Computer requirements are demonstrated by simulating a representative system. Application for this algorithm is foreseen to be in the off-line estimation and model validity assessment of network equivalent models which are used in several on-line applications."
"The effects of static excitation systems with and without reverse current capability are examined in the context of load rejection conditions on synchronous generators connected to high voltage transmission lines."
"This paper describes the mathematical modelling of a synchronous generator and its controls, applied to the fault-throwing tests carried out at Northfleet Power Station, G.B. The derivation of the parameters of the model is detailed, and the model is then used to predict the behaviour of the generator when it is operated at the limit of its dynamic stability."
"The load flow study has been at the center of studies made for designing and operating power systems for many years. It is well known that forecasted data used in load flow studies contain errors that affect the solution, as can be evidenced by running many cases perturbing the input data. This paper presents a method for calculating the effect of the propagation of data inaccuracies through the load flow calculations, thus obtaining a range of values for each output quantity that, to a high degree of probability, encloses the operating conditions of the system. The method is efficient and can be added to any existing load flow program. Results of cases run on the AEP system are included."
"The application of superconductors in the field windings of large steam-turbine generators appears to offer a number of significant economic and operational advantages. The principal advantage offered by such machines appears to be a potentially large reduction in size, weight, and cost for a given power rating. In addition, superconducting alternators also appear to have a number of unique and potentially advantageous operational characteristics, most of which are a consequence of the relatively low per-unit synchronous reactance that is characteristic of these machines. This paper reviews the reasons for the low synchronous reactance attributable to the use of superconducting field winding, and compares the expected performance characteristics of a superconducting alternator in the 1000 MVA range with those of a conventional power system generator of comparable rating. Among the specific topics discussed are performance with regard to dynamic stability, transient stability, voltage regulation, and excitation control. The principal operational advantages of a superconducting alternator appear to be 1) the absence of a dynamic stability limit within its MVA capability, 2) significantly greater transient stability when operating at leading power factors, 3) superior voltage regulation, and 4) no degradation of dynamic stability due to automatic voltage regulator action. Consequently, superconducting alternators appear to be ideally matched to modern power system applications that require operation of generators at leading power factors."
"A simulation study is performed for the purpose of determining the transient stability characteristics of superconducting alternators. This simulation is compared with an equal area criterion method. It is found that superconducting machines have good transient stability characteristics, that field forcing is not particularly helpful nor necessary. It is also found that the equal area criterion is useful for computing critical clearing times, if voltage behind subtransient reactance is held constant."
"The state estimation problem in electric power systems consists of four basic operations: hypothesize structure; estimate; detect; identify. This paper addresses the last two problems with respect to the bad data and structural error problem. The paper interrelates various detection and identification methods (sum of squared residuals, weighted and normalized residuals, nonquadratic criteria) and presents new results on bad data analysis (probability of detection, effect of bad data). The theoretical results are illustrated by means of a 25 bus network."
"Means are considered whereby the separate subconductors of a bundle-conductor line may be insulated from one another for the purpose of intrabundle communication without detracting from the performance of the line in its primary function of power-frequency transmission. Design criteria are derived for those fittings which would be required to replace conventional ones, and outline designs in suitable materials are suggested for this purpose. Based on the incorporation of such insulated fittings, consideration is given to the effects on the line performance which may be expected from a variety of incidents including mechanical, climatic, power-frequency and surge phenomena, compared to the known performance of a line of conventional construction. It is concluded that no adverse performance would be expected for power transmission and that certain advantages could accrue. Consideration is also given to the effects of the same incidents upon the superimposed communication link, and it is shown that these effects are likely to be of a minor nature and mainly transitory."
"The main properties of power line carrier (p.l.c.) systems, used conventionally for internal communication purposes in electricity supply undertakings, are examined, and an alternative method for use on bundle-conductor lines is proposed. Earlier work, departing from the use of conventional phase-ground or interphase carrier, proposed the electrical separation of the subconductors of a bundle for signal frequencies, but retained the remaining aspects of conventional p.l.c. These include particularly the expensive filter components required to limit the signal, as far as possible, to the desired parts of the power network, together with the frequency and bandwidth limitation imposed on the signal by these filters. The intrabundle communication system proposed uses a simple, inexpensive but highly efficient broadband coupling method which permits signal-isolation between subconductors without inserting additional impedance at power frequency or reducing the power transmission capability of the line. The signal characteristics of the new system are such that interference is reduced by orders of magnitude in comparison to p.l.c., avoiding need for frequency assignment even between adjacent phases. A bandwidth of 1.6 MHz is available. This may be exploited in a variety of ways, including the transmission of data at faster rates, to enhance the reliability and speed of protection signalling, or to provide up to 180 duplex voice channels. Even where one voice channel only is required, the cost of an intrabundle communication system is estimated to be less than that of a p.l.c, system for route lengths of at least 29 km, and allows subsequent increase in the voice channel numbers at low extra cost."
"Recently, a new algorithm for calculating simultaneous power interchange capacity for a power system has appeared in the literature [1]: the method exploits a linearized load flow model appealing to linear programming to maximize the simultaneous power interchange. Realistic constraints in such a calculation must include limitations on available generation via interchanges. The latter is non-deterministic, and it is desirable to use a stochastic model in representing generation margin constraints for interchange studies. In this paper, the linearized load flow model is written in compact matrix notation and generation constraints are considered to be multivariate normal. Under these conditions, the simultaneous interchange capacity becomes a random variable. The statistics of the simultaneous interchange capacity are obtained using information from the Simplex tableau used in the linear programming solution. In a wide variety of cases, virtually no additional calculation is required over the deterministic model in order to obtain these statistics."
 "This paper describes a statistical analysis of impulse breakdown stress of cross-linked polyethylene insulated cable (XLPE cable) with the concept of weak-point distribution in insulation. The dependence of breakdown stress on cable size is presented. Comparing them with failure data, it is found that the breakdown stress depends not on maximum stress at the conductor but on average stress throughout the insulation Weibull distribution location parameter is estimated. The relation between breakdown stress and cable length is presented considering the lowest value. Breakdown characteristics caused by repeated impulse application are also investigated."
"The paper analyzes the wetting process during the testing of artificially contaminated insulators. A calculation method is developed to determine the rate of wetting by condensation and by the collision of water droplets with the insulator surface. Series of tests show that the flashover voltage, the washing effect of fog and the leakage current all depend on the fog conditions. Different fog-generation methods (cold, warm, steam) are compared on the basis of calculations and experimental results. The paper concludes that the pollution test results for an artificially contaminated insulator depend on the fog parameters and the fog generation method. The operation of the fog chamber can be optimized by adjusting the fog parameters to achieve the minimum flashover voltage."
"The three quantities are (1) residual fault current, (2) steady-state recovery voltage, and (3) natural frequency of transient recovery voltage. Loci of constant values of each of these, plotted in rectangular coordinates of degree of zero-sequence shunt compensation versus degree of positive-sequence shunt compensation, are straight lines. The assignment of sets of such constant values gives a family of straight lines. The first family, representing fault current, are parallel and have positive slope. The third family, representing natural frequencies are parallel and have negative slope. The second family, representing recovery voltage, has differing slopes but all lines pass through a common point at coordinates 1,1."
"This paper discusses the application of probability methods to the determination of daily operating reserve objectives for the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection (PJM). The paper summarizes PJM reserve policy and the developments leading to the present operating reserve and generation risk analysis program. Descriptions are offered of the generation and load models, the data reduction techniques, and the statistical analysis procedures for the generator outage data. The paper also contains typical comparative results obtained from applications of the program."
"Model tests are described which have been conducted to investigate the performance of \"weak\" a.c. systems with d.c. injection. It is shown that system frequency can be controlled effectively by h.v.d.c, inverter stations. Switched capacitors may be used for voltage control. It is shown that power injection into a.c. systems by line commutated h.v.d.c, inverters is possible down to short circuit ratios far below 1."
"The traveling-wave response of a 33-kV, flat-spaced three-phase line to symmetrically impressed double-exponential-surge excitation was predicted from Carson's equations. The following modified asymptotic approximation was derived for the propagation functions of the two symmetrical-type natural modes. rAn= s√µ0ε0+ b1√s+η+b2Here η = 2(b2b1)2if b2< 0 (high-loss mode); η = 0 if b2> 0 (low-loss mode). The approximate voltage transform in terms of γAnhas a closed-form inverse. Numerical integration was used to compute a corrective voltage term. Predicted results for distances from 0.8 miles to 7.98 miles from the source compared favorably with earlier oscillograms for voltages below the corona-onset level."
"Five single-phase short-circuit tests were performed on the live 735-kV system. Transient currents and voltages were recorded on magnetic tape. The transmission system under fault conditions was simulated on a digital computer. The measured and simulated transients were superimposed on the same graphs using a computer-controlled plotter. The accuracy of measurements was evaluated and the graphs of the simulated transients were compared with those of the measured ones. This comparative study was then used for an experimental check of the computer simulation and provided reassurance that the system modeling was precise enough for further transient analyses."
"The existing standard for short-circuit withstand capability of transformers is reviewed and areas of inadequacy are identified. For each of these areas, background material is presented to summarize state-of-the-art knowledge which should be considered by the parties involved in revision of the standard. Recommendations are made for revision of some specific sections."
"A multi-machine excitation feedback stabilizer is designed using a model of the interconnected system which is identified from measurements made only on the controlled machines themselves. The concept is tested against a high order sophisticated system simulation with many imbedded unknown elements of load and generation."
"Tests with a rod-plane gap with a rounded termination of the rod show that the delay of the first corona pulse affects the positive switching impulse breakdown probability. The inverted S form or local inconsistencies of the breakdown probability distribution are connected with particular statistical features of the delay of the first corona pulse. The influence of the rod termination or the impulse front on the breakdown probability distribution is explained in terms of the delay of the first corona pulse."
"A new method of cross-linked polyethylene cables, vulcanization in inert gas, was researched and developed. In this paper, the principle of the new method of the gas curing process is explained. And then the electrical and physical properties of the cables cured in inert gas are outlined and are compared with those of the cables cured in steam. It is found that the curing method and condition have heavy influence on the micro-structure of the XLPE (cross-linked polyethylene) insulation and electrical strength. In conclusion, we can cure the polyethylene cables in the flow of the high temperature and high pressure inert gas. A.C and impulse breakdown voltage of the cables cured in inert gas (gas-cured cable) were respectively higher about 50∼70% and 20∼ 70% than those of the cables cured in steam (steam-cured cable). By our new method of the gas curing process perhaps insulation thickness will be reduced to 70∼60% of that of the present steam-cured cables. It will be of great advantage to use this method in manufacturing EHV XL-PE insulated power cables."
"Recent investigations of systems involving vacuum switching have forced a reappraisal of the traditional protection methods necessitating major changes in protection philosophy. The new philosophy has been developed on industrial systems supplying are furnace transformers where the exceedingly large number of switchings makes such systems particularly sensitive. This paper discusses a new transient voltage protection system which has been developed in response to these recent investigations. In support of the development of the new protection system, transient voltage measurements have been made on 14 are furnace systems at various locations within the United States and abroad. This paper also documents the instrumentation used to monitor transients on these systems and describes its application. Typical oscillographic records are presented as indications of the performance of the system with and without the new transient voltage protection system."
"The paper deals with a method for the reliability evaluation of a power generation and transmission system, when considering, together with the constraints on the active power capability of elements, the voltage constraint in network nodes. The approach suggested is an extension of a previous method for the reliability evaluation when considering only the active power capability constraints. The method is based on the approximate evaluation, by means of linear computation methods, of the reactive power flows and of the consequent voltage values in network nodes. This evaluation is performed starting from the approximate evaluation of the active power flow derived with the classic method of d.c. load-flow computation. The system performance, as a consequence of voltage constraints, is quantitatively evaluated by means of two indices: the first being the power disconnected in the nodes as a consequence of unacceptable voltage values or lack of reactive generation, the second being the irregularity of the voltage Service."
"This paper deals with numerical methods for calculation of electrical stresses in HVdc cables. The design of the \"Skagerrak cable\" i.e. the 130 km long dc submarine cable between Norway and Denmark, is described, and various calculations, both under stationary and transient condition of the cable, are given. The numerical methods permit both voltage, current and temperature to be time-dependent. Electrical stress distributions are shown both for service conditions and for recommended tests."
"This paper presents the test data obtained on a 33 kV rood-pole line. Distortion and attenuation of waves above or Below corona are given. The line construction and the different waves applied in different ways render the data particularly suitable for checking theoretical and computational results. A new phenomenon is observed on the effect of corona."
"This paper presents the results of an investigation of a technique for the evaluation of the reliability of supplying power in a system with a number of interconnected load-generation areas. There is no restriction as to how the areas may be interconnected. Most previous techniques using analytical methods (as opposed to Monte Carlo simulations) have been limited to systems with a maximum of three interconnected areas. Systems with more areas have been analyzed assuming that the interconnecting electrical network did not contain any loops. The application of straightforward enumerative methods to systems with more complex interconnections than these can result in an improbably large number of computations. The method of analysis described in this paper is based upon the use of a linear flow network to model the transmission interconnections and makes use of an efficient graph theory algorithm to segregate the failure states by finding critical minimal cuts in the network. The probabilities of failure to supply the various loads are computed by evaluating the various combined event probabilities associated with these critical minimal cuts. For the cases tested, the technique reduces the number of probability evaluations required by about one to two orders of magnitude in comparison with complete state enumeration methods. The tested method provides reliability measures (i.e., the probability of failure to meet the load) for each individual area and the total system, and also allows the computation of the probability that each \"link\" (transmission line or source) is a member of a critical minimal cut. The latter will facilitate the application of the method to the design of systems and specifically to the problem of evaluating the reliability benefits of increased transmission capacity versus added generation."
"A comprehensive series of impulse tests on a variety of simulated UHV tower windows is described in this paper. The tests overlap and extend existing data, making available switching surge flashover characteristics of tower windows up to 37 meters in width. All of the raw test data is included for comparison with similar programs in other laboratories. The effects of several variables on statistically derived flashover voltages are described, and application data for tower insulation up to 1900-kV transmission levels is derived from the test data."

"This paper explores the accuracy of the digital methods for protection of high voltage transmission lines under transient fault condition on a long line and describes an improved method for future digital protection schemes. With this method it is possible to calculate R and L of high voltage transmission lines so that any number of harmonics on the current and voltage waveforms can be eliminated and it is shown to be suitable for distance protection during the first cycle of fault occurrence."
"The switching-surge behavior of UHV station electrodes was studied by investigating the performance of sphere-plane gaps. Design curves which show the effect of electrode curvature on the critical flashover voltage for spheres ranging in diameter from 0.5 to 2.5 meters and with gap spacings between 1 and 11 meters are presented. The influence of waveshape on large electrode flashover characteristics was obtained by varying the time-to-crest of the applied waveforms between 75 and 1220 µs. Test data are given for smooth and segmented spheres during dry conditions. The effect of precipitation on the switchlng-surge strength was investigated by wetting the sphere surfaces either by natural rain or artificial means. The results presented provide information required for the switchlng-surge design of outdoor UHV stations."
"The paper presents a new approach to the calculation of transients on transmission lines with frequency-dependent parameters. Its purpose is to obtain significant computer-time savings by avoiding convolutions. This is achieved by approximating all line and ground distortions and also time variable characteristic admittances by exponential functions, i.e. solutions of linear differential equations. The method produces a simple Norton-type line equivalent which permits its incorporation into an existing system representation like the B.P.A. program for the calculation of transients. The program has been tested on systems of different degrees of complexity and proved to be superior, in terms of speed and accuracy, to other advanced methods."
"Power systems are built up from components of widely different nature: lumped parameter elements, linear or nonlinear, transmission lines with ground return, and complex components, such as generators or transformers. Their common feature is the appropriateness of a nodal terminal description. The paper shows that a component of any type can be adequately modelled, for a numerical algorithm, by a Norton-type multiport nodal equivalent, with time-varying current sources at the terminals. As a result, a general algorithm is obtained for the calculation of electric transients in complex systems."
"The paper describes a computer method for analysing substation electrical configuration in order to define protection zones in the substation, and to devise the correct strategy to be adopted in the event of a fault being detected in any of the zones. The protection strategy logic provides maximum discrimination in fault location, takes account of changes in substation switching arrangements, considers remote tripping requirements, is able to handle simultaneous faults, and includes the facility to initiate back-up protection operations when necessary. The scheme ensures fail-safe operation in the event of a wide range of switch status indication errors, and voltage and current measurement errors. The scheme is suited to a substation whose control functions are co-ordinated by an on-line digital computer. The results of a simulated application of the methods to a 132 kV substation are described."
"The paper describes an experimental research performed in the anechoic chamber with the aim of investigating the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the acoustic noise caused by a.c.corona on conductors. Conductors of different type and size, smooth and stranded, with and without surface treatment, were tested dry and wet within a large range of voltage gradients. On the basis of the results obtained, a number of conclusions is drawn concerning: the nature of the phenomenon, and in particular the characteristics of the frequency spectra; the laws related to noise variation with voltage gradient, conductor diameter and number of subconductors per phase; the physiological effects of the audible noise."
"A 1400-MW dynamic braking resistor installed at the Bonneville Power Administration's (BPA) Chief Joseph Substation enhances system stability in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). The capacity of the Pacific Northwest-Southwest (PNW-SW) Intertie is increased by the use of resistor braking for faults in the PNW. The need of and benefits from the use of the brake are discussed. The physical and electrical characteristics of the brake are described as well as the control system for its operation."
"This paper describes in some detail, a complete set of algorithms for assembling digital and analog models of transformer and reactor saturation behavior. Included are procedures for converting saturation characteristics expressed in RMS quantities to peak and instantaneous quantities. The more commonly made errors are carefully identified. Sensitivity studies conducted for two typical examples are used to illustrate the relative importance of the more important transformer model features."
"The paper summarizes the most significant results of a Transient Network Analyzer study performed for the Itaipu transmission system in Brazil. This study considers an installed capacity of 10000 MW to be transmitted over 900 km from the Itaipu power plant to the São Paulo load area. Fault initiation, fault clearing, energization and reclosing overvoltages on two possible 750 kV ac schemes are mainly described. Emphasis is placed on some special transients which can be associated with series-compensated schemes and which can be of importance to insulation co-ordination, reclosing and equipment specification. Methods for controlling these transients are also proposed."
"This paper reports technical findings and recommendations resulting from a joint SCE/TRW study of Instrumentation and Control alternatives for use in future EHV substations on the Edison system. It contains analyses and design criteria that should be followed when a digital, computer-oriented, instrumentation and control system is contemplated as the primary instrumentation and control system in an EHV substation. Attention is also given to the electromagnetic environment found in EHV substations."
"The conditions for bundle instability were determined for spring-mounted, sectional models in the wind tunnel. The stability boundaries are in good agreement with predicted values from a quasi-steady analysis using measured mean forces. The analytical model was extended to a three-dimensional, multi-subspan catenary. Predictions were compared to some observations from a full-scale line and from a reduced scale span in a large wind tunnel. Experimental and analytical studies showed that twisting the bundle through 30 degrees per subspan prevents subspan oscillation. Extensive wake measurements suggest that some of the mean vertical force on downstream conductors is due to wake static pressure gradients."
"A proposal is presented for compensation of long ac transmission lines entirely by shunt devices designated as reactance controllers. Fundamental design of the reactance controller as a transmission line shunt compensating device is established. Application of reactance controllers to transmission lines is described as well as a theoretical approach for the Transmission Planner to evaluate controlled shunt reactance compensation for future and existing transmission schemes."
"Host currently used thermal-generator maintenance scheduling methods schedule each unit at a time, leading in many cases to a poor local optimum or to an unfeasible solution. Considering simultaneously all units in the scheduling process, a computationally impractical method results. In this paper a piece-wise compromising method of solution is presented, which conveniently groups generating units and uses successive approximations dynamic programming. The optimal maintenance scheduling problem is formulated by employing a suitable state-space representation; most common constraints used in practice are described and a multiple objective function is presented. The effectiveness of the optimizing method is illustrated by solving a problem with data obtained from a real system. The grouping criterion presented appears to be the cornerstone of the superior performance of the proposed method."
"One of the major difficulties in using the Lyapunov method for on-line transient stability is the determination of the critical value of the V-function which describes the stability boundary. In one method the Vcriticalis taken to be the minimum value of the V-function evaluated at (2n-1-1) unstable equilibrium points (u.e.p.). In this paper it is shown that an accurate determination of these points is not necessary and using the analogy of 1-mechine-infinite bus example, (2n-1-1) u.e.p.'s can be approximately obtained. Two multimachine systems (4 and 9- machine) are used as examples. The error in the stability boundary by using approximate method is shown to be acceptable. The use of Newton-Raphson method to calculate the post-fault stable equilibrium point is suggested. Also the type of mathematical model which is sufficient to represent both uniformly and non-uniformly damped multimachine systems is discussed."

"The investigation of excitation system interaction in a two machine infinite bus system is reported. Steady-state stability is studied by means of calculating the eigenvalues from the small displacement system equations. A hybrid computer representation of the system is used to verify the performance predicted by the small displacement analysis and to illustrate the form of the natural mechanical oscillations as well as the mechanical oscillations introduced by the excitation systems. This investigation reveals that the possibility of the interaction of excitation systems should be taken into account when machines are closely tied electrically. Also, in order to portray accurately the dynamic performance during system disturbances such as a system fault, it is necessary to represent the machine and excitation system in detail."
"A multichannel pulse-height analyzer has been used to carry out statistical analyses of the corona pulse density patterns of EPR and XLPE insulated distribution cables. The corona pulse probability density functions obtained on these cables were studied as a function of applied voltage and time. The practical implications of the test results are discussed in the light of present corona level specifications, cable insulation geometry and type as well as insulation system life."
"This paper presents a further step in the development of accurate and consistent techniques for the reliability evaluation of transmission and distribution systems. A theoretically accurate Markov approach6is limited in application because of computer storage requirements and the rounding errors which occur in the solution of relatively large systems. This paper extends the modified approximate technique presented in reference (P) to permit evaluation of the contribution to the system reliability indices of different modes of component outage. The equations developed give results which compare very closely those predicted by the Markov approach. A three state weather model is developed to illustrate the effect of severe adverse weather periods on the system reliability performance. The load point failure modes considered are those which arise due to component permanent, temporary, maintenance and overload outages."
"This paper is primarily concerned with the formulation of a group of simple equations which can be used to provide numerical estimates of the rates and durations of system load point failures. The reliability indices obtained by an existing approximate technique2and by the equations developed in this paper are compared with those obtained by a Markov approach using a two state weather model. An equivalent component formation method suggested in the literature5is investigated. The paper shows that this method gives results which are no better than those obtained by the approximate technique2. The modified equations presented in this paper provide reliability indices which compare very closely with those calculated by the Markov approach. The concepts developed are extended to more complex configurations in which loadpoint reliability parameters are obtained by the technique of failure modes and effects analysis and therefore eliminate the necessity of forming equivalent components."
"This paper describes a method by means of which the wave resistance and, approximately, the negative-sequence losses of anisotropic turbo-rotors can be determined from standstill measurements on the test bed and divided into the components for the pole and field winding regions. For turbo-rotors with incomplete damper cage a marked difference can be demonstrated between the specific surface resistances and losses of these two peripheral zones, which may be attributed entirely to the pole iron. When the damper cage is complete, this iron is largely relieved. Thus the pronounced influence of the damper Structure on the rotor wave resistance, as well as on the negative-sequence resistance and losses of solid-rotor synchronous machines is proved direct and confirmed quantitatively."
"Negative-sequence losses in solid cylindrical rotors of turbo-generators determined by factory tests performed on a wide range of machine sizes and rotor designs, when treated in a specific manner, yield typical curves. These can be condensed into a characteristic quantity called the rotor wave resistance, which is the real part of the wave impedance, and which assumes definite numerical values for typical damper structures. It can be used for the overall determination of the negative-sequence losses of the rotor, thus facilitating the practical design of a rotor for given duties. But knowledge of the rotor wave resistance also allows the negative-sequence resistance of the machine to be predicted reliably, thereby checking and supplementing the theoretical analysis of synchronous machines."
"The negative-sequence losses and their calculation are of great significance for large turbogenerators having high utilization factors. A generalized method for the determination of negative-sequence losses and negative-sequence resistance is given. With the help of equivalent circuits, accounting for all the given constructional particularities of the rotor, the influences of the construction of damper winding, wedges and massive rotor are thoroughly investigated and explicated. These studies yield indications on the mode of participation of the damper winding during steady state as well as transient unbalanced loading."
"The behavior of 15-kV, 28-kA vacuum interrupters, when subjected to fault duty operations at voltages up to 30 kV, or currents up to 80 kA, is explored. Insight into the physical factors governing this behavior is presented as are the consequences of subjecting the vacuum device to such abnormal duty conditions."
"Significant improvements in the performance of the triac voltage control of split-phase fan motors can be achieved by increasing the rotor resistance and winding ratio. These improvements include a reduction in the maximum main winding current and an increase in the speed stability throughout the control range. The analysis of the motor performance with triac control of the main winding voltage only, is based on independent consideration of the functional (supply) frequency and harmonic content of the applied chopped sinusoidal voltage. Excellent agreement with measured results is obtained and comparision with variac control can be made directly."
"Fan speed control of permanent capacitor run motors using triacs creates unbalance resulting from both amplitude and phase. The use of a force-commutation triac has greatly reduced this unbalance by advancing the fundamental of the main winding current at reduced speeds. The extra harmonics generated only slightly reduce the benefits of less unbalanced operation, and by using two triac conduction periods per half cycle, the third harmonic has been eliminated yielding further reductions of current, amounting in all to 35%."
"The characteristics and maneuverability of pressurized heavy water nuclear power units operated for base-load and load-following generation are discussed with respect to the requirements of Ontario Hydro. The nuclear generating units of Pickering G.S. 'A' (Units 1-4) and Pickering G.S. 'B' (being designed for Units 5-8), and the turbine-generator-grid of Bruce G .S. 'A' (Units 1-4) were simulated on digital computers. Simulation tests such as normal loading and unloading at various rates, grid frequency upset, and grid islanded cases were conducted with the unit load regulated by three alternative unit power control systems. The results of the simulation show that the necessary flexibility in power maneuvers to meet the load-following requirements in the Ontario Hydro system may be obtained with the CANDU-PHW (Canadian Deuterium Uranium - Pressurized Heavy Water) generating units controlled by an integrated unit load control system which normally operates in a reactor-following-turbine unit control mode. The simulation results also show that the reactor-following-turbine unit control improves the control of many process systems and the overall plant performance."
"The paper examines the influence of the overvoltages due to fault initiation and clearing on the choice of the air clearances of UHV lines. The study is carried out with particular reference to a network structure representative of the first stage of development of a UHV grid-type system."
"A review and comparative study of the various optimisation methods applied to electrical power systems is made in this paper. The linear optimal control derived by solving the matrix Riccati equation requires feedback of all the state variables. It is shown that the suboptimal control using feedback of a selected number of variables derived by Liapunov method can be equally effective. Under certain conditions optimal control derived from lineamised system equations can give improved system perfommance following large disturbances. However to achieve maximum improvement it is necessary to retain all the system nonlinearities in the optimisation procedure. A method of optimising a system for a nonlinear mode of operation retaining the advantages of closed loop control is described. Finally, the feasibility of practical implementation is investigated by incorporating the various optimal controls derived in a laboratory micromachine system."
  "Compared to the remote control of a conventional generation only plant, the problems encountered with controlling a pumped-storage generating plant are unique and, certainly, more challenging. The fact that the Raccoon Mountain powerhouse and switchyard are separated by approximately 1-1/2 miles (2.44 km), makes the configuration of the data acquisition and supervisory control remote terminals more complex. Two computers are used, one at the powerhouse and one at the switchyard. This configuration eliminates huge quantities of very expensive control cabling between the two structures and provides a more reliable and efficient operation."
"Starting from a discussion of the fundamental characteristics of modern interconnected power systems, this paper goes on to categorize requirements for dynamic performance and response imposed on the aggregate generation which supplies the system. Both normal and abnormal operating modes are considered. The performance and response requirements are shown to stem from basic needs to maintain voltage, frequency, time, and continuity of service as well as the secondary requirements of maintaining operating economies and controlling inadvertent interchange between neighboring power systems. Typical data taken from operating records are used to illustrate and quantify several of the response requirements."
"This paper describes the uses of a digital computer program developed to simulate the long-term dynamics of bulk power systems. Power system long-term dynamics, including effects dominant in the period extending for several minutes, often determine whether a power system will successfully avoid cascading failure following a major disturbance. The paper describes the simulation of an evolving disturbance on a hypothetical power system using both a conventional short-term simulation program and a new long-term simulation program. Results for three measures devised to modify the system capability to withstand the disturbance are included."
"This paper deals with the operation of a parametric transformer when both the input and output windings are connected to live busbars. The relationship between each core flux and the MMF's of the two windings is explained. Based on this relationship, the voltage equations of the device are integrated numerically to obtain the input and output currents and the power-angle characteristics. The effects of the phase angle \"δ\" between the two busbar voltages on the power flow, efficiency, power factor and harmonic currents are examined. A comparison between the experimental results on a small unit and those obtained from the numerical solution of the equations is also given."
"Following the Galerkin projective technique, first-order triangular finite elements are derived for the nonlinear diffusion equation-in the general form which includes both time-dependent and notional terms. The method is applied to a simplified model of a single-sided linear induction motor, for which the finite element equations are solved by an implicit method in time, and iteratively in space. The results suggest that the screening effect of eddy currents in the iron is quite strong."
"An algorithim for calculating apparent transmission line impedance to the point of a fault is presented as an approach to distance type protection via a dedicated digital computer. Phase voltages and currents are sampled asynchronously approximately 24 times per cycle and operated on to yield apparent resistances and reactances. Descrimination between phase to phase, phase to ground and two phase to ground faults is considered. The effects of disturbances such as transformer magnetizing inrush currents, assymetrical currents, sensor response, as well as results which can be expected when the power system frequency is higher or lower than nominal are discussed. The reach accuracy of the system is reported using simple statistical measures obtained from simulating the operation of the digital relay on an IBM 360/65 computer. These simulations verify the approach is feasible."
"Mathematical models are required to calculate tie flows for allocating generation among groups of interconnected companies, for costing and cost reconstruction of power interchanges between companies or pools, and for a variety of security functions. This paper presents new procedures for modelling the many ties between groups of interconnected power companies. The systems whose interconnections are modelled can represent one pool or a multiplicity of power pools, typical of U. S. systems. Novel procedures of constructing the interconnection models are described, including the automatic formation of topological matrices which define the circulating and interchange paths existing in the interconnections. The models can be used in both off-line studies and in real time operations of power systems. Results are represented verifying the development."
"Starting from experimental results on final jump and using physical interpretations of first corona and leader process, a computer aided method is proposed to determine a \"limit-volt-time\" curve. Furthermore, it is shown that the time to breakdown, U50and σU50can be deduced once the impulse shape applied to a given gap is known provided that one utilizes the \"intrinsic probability density\" concept."
 "The protection of pumped storage units, although essentially the same as conventional generators, requires additional relays and close attention to the phase relationship of relay inputs because of the unusual modes of operation. This paper reviews the various protective devices that may be employed in the protection of a pumped storage unit, which includes the generator/motor, phase reversing switches, circuit breakers, main transformer, and the connections between these components. It does not include protective devices associated with auxiliary equipment such as station service transformers, starting motors, static converter starting devices, etc."
"The paper reviews the experience obtained with series-compensated power systems, particularly in Sweden, where internally fused capacitor units and simple system designs have contributed to the the good results. It also introduces new approaches for meeting future demands, e.g., optronic protection and a high-speed flip-flop reinsertion system."

It provides a standard basis for the design, detailing, furnishing and testing of aluminum towers. The design criteria reflects the experience of major suppliers and users in the United States."
"A method for handling boundary conditions in multipolar magnetic field systems is described. This method allows quite complex boundaries (including those with loss) to be handled quite simply. A prototype field problem is worked and a few boundary conditions are derived."
"A high impedance bus protection relay using thyristors and based on instantaneous voltage measurement is described. Half-cycle operating speed is achieved and power dissipation is minimized. Application is no longer limited by the kneepoint of the C.T. excitation characteristic and peak C.T. secondary voltages are accurately limited, regardless of fault magnitude."
"This paper presents the results of a survey taken by the Working Group on Sequential Events Recording Systems (SERS) of present and predicted usages of SERS within the Electric Utility Industry. The results of this survey were the impetus for further effort by the Working Group in developing a Glossary of terms and recommended applications for SERS."
"The necessity for 200 mva underground cable circuits to supply two new 120/13.2 kV compact (SF6) mini-subs in Detroit was resolved in an innovative way by Edison. The duct and manhole system was designed for self-contained oll filled cables. The cable system incorporated sheath insulation and crossbonding to minimize sheath losses,and an oil pressurized supply system required cable sheaths capable of 35-40 psi nominal operating pressure. The first circuit featured lower cost, reduced size jointing manholes with a new cable clamping and restraint system. During the installation, a completely new MIG welded connector had to be developed for 2500 kcmil (1250 mm2) Aluminum conductor designed for this cable and this manhole system. Operating experience to date attests to the effectiveness and integrity of these new and economical advantages complementing the self-contained oil filled cable system."
"A major challenge in the design and application of single conductor shielded power cable is to minimize losses in the insulation shield and at the same time provide adequate fault current capability for the shield. This paper discusses a test program and the results obtained in the investigation of fault current in the shield and fault current capability of the shield of a new cable design (embedded copper wire shield) as compared to an existing cable design (copper tape shield). The methods used should be of interest to cable producers and users in the investigation of other cable shield designs."
"Design characteristics of high voltage cables with extruded insulation can be established by use of the failure probability distribution of the insulation materials involved The evaluation of the distribution parameters is discussed and the validity of the theory for a wide range o f cable dimensions is proved. Also discussed is the importance that, in order to ensure cable reliability, these parameters should remain constant for time intervals ranging from a few minutes to many years. Finally it is shown by analysis of the relative influence of the distribution parameters how it is possible to establish the insulation requirements for the design of 60 to 138 kV cables."
"The use of I2T to extrapolate data points of watthour meter destructive failure tests over a wide range of fault durations is questioned. Data from an experiment using special test fixtures designed for ease of calculation of the electromechanical forces associated with fault currents is discussed for faults to failure having different current magnitudes and durations. High-current-short-duration faults required significantly lower I2T levels to produce a given failure mode than did low-current-long-duration faults. Several failure modes are defined. Confirming tests were made with modern single-phase watt-hour meters."
"A nuclear power plant generally consists of subsystems that may employ any of the partial, standby and active redundancies. The design of such a mixed redundancy system under some techno-economic constraints, is quite important in order to achieve specific objectives. Often the design objective is to maximize the system reliability under the given constraints (mainly the cost constraint). In the present paper an algorithm is described which makes the solution of this mathematically difficult problem possible. The algorithm has been found powerful and efficient to solve such a design problem. Some examples are demonstrated. To achieve further efficiency a study was organized and the recommendations for obtaining a minimum solution time, are provided."
"In the repulsive magnetic levitation of a superconducting magnet by a finite width strip guideway, the transverse force is destablizing in that it acts in a direction to deflect the magnet off the guideway. The theoretical calculation of this transverse force is accomplished in this paper and its predictions are shown to correlate with published experimental data. A search for a laterally-stable magnet configuration has turned up a successful design based on paired magnets. The force characterisitcs of this configuration shows that it has possible applications in high speed guided ground transport. A physical explanation is given for its transverse stabilizing property."
"This study presents statistical analyses of the response of models of electrical power equipment to a variety of base inputs including historical earthquakes, computer-generated artificial earthquakes, and sine beats and steady state sines. The data presented provides model response comparisons, between 1) historical earthquake ensembles and artificial earthquakes; 2) earthquake-like base motion and the currently used sine beat and steady-state sine base motions. Finally, from the comparisons, the applicability of sine beat and steady-state sine inputs to multiple-degree-of-freedom systems is presented and the limitations discussed."
"This paper describes an investigation into the discharge resistance of high grades of Muscovite and Phlogopite micas. Internal discharge experiments have been performed in air at NTP with electric stress up to 8 kV mm-1with a frequency acceleration factor of 24. The samples were not tested to breakdown but examined at selected times up to an equivalent period of ten years at power frequency. Both types of mica experienced a similar pattern of deterioration starting with a surface crazing and the development of minute nodules. With continued discharge attack the crazed surface began to peel exposing newly cleaved surfaces which subsequently, repeated the peeling effect, resulting in puncture of the flake at the centre of these areas. During this development initially curled flakes and surface nodules develop dendritic formations modifying the electric stress and enhancing the discharge attack. Micro-probe analyses of the surfaces and surface products at various stages of degradation indicated that depletion and removal of the metallic cations had occurred in the micas resulting in a collapse of their crystalline stability and the formation of silica. The lost cations were found present as metallic salts in solution and solidified residues on the mica surfaces."
"This study reports on measurements with multiple techniques delineating the complete sequence of events from the corona streamer to the arc phase in the spark transition for large rod-to-plane air gaps applied by positive switching impulses. Observations with a image converter camera, photomultipliers, a Boys camera, and still cameras as well as measurements of voltages and currents have revealed that starting with the corona streamer the breakdown proceeds through the development of the leader and the intermittent appearance of the light flash to the final spark formation. The detailed analyses were made to the corona streamer, intermittent flashes, and the final transition to the arc phase with extremely high time-resolution techniques."
"The paper shows that in load flow calculations performed by Newton's method one can estimate, as a by-product of the solution, the steady-state stability of the operating condition in question. In order to make this estimate more reliable and to improve convergence of the iterative solution it is expedient to use a modified Newton's algorithm - supplemented with proper alterations of the iterative corrections. The practical ways to determine the steady-state stability limits are also described in the paper."
"A new power flow model has been developed for the steady state behavior of large complex power systems, it allows the study of power flow under abnormal conditions as well as normal conditions. It is also shown how Newton's method can be efficiently applied to the model to provide exact and practicable solutions for a new steady state following the disturbance. Advanced applications are introduced which show how the steady state model can be combined with a dynamic simulation program."
"For internal arc faults in metalclad SF6 switchgear the main parameters fault current, arc voltage, fault duration, enclosed volume and material of the enclosure are discussed in relation to test results. The effects in connection with pressure rise and melting through are stated, from which the requirements to be complied with by SF6 installations are derived. Measures to restrict the effects of arc faults are compared and a solution deduced which satisfies the requirements imposed."
"The oil-cooled outdoor thyristor valves for the first stage of the 1920 MW, 860 mile d.c. link between the Cabora Bassa hydro power station in Mozambique and Pretoria, South Africa, which is first to transmit power in early 1975, are described. A brief summary of the extensive valve type tests carried out successfully at the world's largest HVDC valve testing facilities is added."
"Single-pole switching and reclosing becomes of greater importance as the electrical utilities develop EHV and UHV transmission systems. While utilities continue to use the majority of the breakers on a three-pole basis, there exist areas wherein single-pole breaker operation and reclosing are of real merit. Modem EHV and UHV breakers are designed with independent operating mechanisms and therefore are readily available for either three-pole or single-pole operation. The areas of system coucerns - and these characteristics are discussed within the references are system stability, secondary arcing, switching surge overvoltages, and maximum and minimum reclosing times. The Transmission and Distribution Committee of the IEEE Power Engineering Society sponsored the General System Subcommittee under the chairmanship of H.L. Manning, Texas Electric Service Company, and earlier of L.J. Rubino, Ontario Hydro, to prepare this bibliography for the benefit of design, application, and system engineers. A great deal of time and effort goes into the assembly of any bibliography. Appreciation for these efforts are acknowledged to Dr. E.W. Kimbark of Bonneville Power Administration, who supplied the major impetus in obtaining and compiling the references. Appreciation is also expressed to the Working Group members who reviewed and helped edit the listing."

"Two turbogenerators, the largest ever produced with direct water-cooling of both rotor and stator windings, were completed and tested early in 1974. Their losses and efficiency from test, together with temperatures in critical areas and cooling circuit behavior are described. Vibration of coil ends was measured at rated voltage and during sudden short circuit using a newly perfected photo cell technique. Based on the test results, it is estimated that generators can now be built in ratings up to 2400 MVA at 1800 rpm using presently available rotor forgings with water-cooled windings."
"A method of forecasting the heat sensitive portion of electrical demand and energy utilizing a summer weather load model and taking into account probability variation of weather factors is discussed in this paper. The heat sensitive portion of the load is separated from base load and historical data is used to determine the effect of weather on the system load. This method is based on regression analysis of historical load and weather information and the establishment of system load characteristics based on historical or survey information. The method has been determined primarily for forecasting demands and energy for the intermediate range of from 3 to 10 years. However, it is applicable for monthly and annual peak forecasting, but probably not applicable for short terms such as hour to hour or day to day forecast. It may also be helpful in long term forecasting with appropriate forecast of future quantities of heat sensitive load on the system. Separate weather load models are used for determining the heat sensitive portion of electric energy and demand independently. These correlation studies were made when the author was located in Birmingham, Alabama and all of the studies reported here are on systems in that general area. The author hopes to continue these weather-load correlation studies in the northeast area in the near future."
"An investigation of the corona performance of several different conductor bundles for 765/800-kV transmission lines was carried out under a program jointly sponsored by Consumers Power Company and The Detroit Edison Company. The results of tests, carried out on single-phase bundles of 3, 4, 5, and 6 conductors, are presented in the form of generation quantities of audible noise, radio interference, and corona loss. The influence of bundle asymmetry and conductor surface condition on generation quantities was investigated. A comparison of the expected performance of 3- phase transmission lines using several of the tested bundles is given."
"The influence of the different phases of the discharge on the statistics of the breakdown processes has been investigated in a wide range of gap lengths (from 2 to 10 m) and applied voltage levels. The effect of the field distribution, along the gap and of the overvoltage ratio upon the development of each discharge phase, has been studied and the transition between subsequent phases has been analysed. The experimental results have been compared with theoretical predictions; the satisfactory agreement, which has been obtained indicates that the theoretical simulation of the discharge phenomena is relatively advanced and starts to be useful from a engineering point of view."
"In this paper a stability problem on a future power system is identified. The effect of various types of excitation controls is studied. By modification and trial, changes to the exciter which substantially improve the transient stability are developed. The improvements on this future system are demonstrated."
"The transient response of adjacent alternators is examined by means of multivariable control theory. A non-interactive controller is developed based on a linear system model which provides substantial decoupling together with improved transient stability. Examples of the use of the controller are given for both input power and excitation control applied to a simple representation of a three machine system."
"The power system protection function dictates the character of the voltage and current signal processing required in the replacement of switching station instrumentation by digital computers. A complete signal processing technique is designed on the basis of a frequency domain analysis of the protection requirements, and such factors as analog filtering, data window size and sampling frequency are chosen by their frequency characteristícs. The processing technique is demonstrated by applying it to impedance measurement of staged faults. Sub-cycle fault detection is accomplished using an unsynchronized, nonsimultaneous sampling frequency of 240 Hz with simple RC analog filters."
"A new technique for computer simulation of transients on transmission lines with frequency dependent parameters is presented. It is similar to the adaptation of Bergeron's method, which is used in the BPA transients program, but since it uses simpler shaped response functions in the required convolution process, the method inherently requires less storage and computational effort in a time-domain simulation. The main disadvantage of the method is the possible increase in programming effort necessary to handle certain types of boundary conditions. Accuracy of the method is verified by comparison with field tests. A new algorithm is also presented for the computation of transmission line response functions. For the functions evaluated in this paper, the method was found to be extremely accurate and computationally more efficient than the Fast Fourier Transform."
"An accepted practice among some manufacturers of turbogenerators is to provide for the ventilation of stator laminations through axial holes in the teeth in addition to the core. This is especially the case for machines without radial ducts separating packs of laminations. These holes are located in areas of the teeth subject to high degrees of saturation. Under these conditions, flux is diverted into adjacent stator slots. The main component of the diverted flux is radial and is in the area of the strands. Furthermore, this radial flux component is time varying and hence establishes eddy currents in the strands. These eddy currents create additional losses. Therefore, the size and location of such ventilation holes is critical if the added component of radial flux losses is not to produce spots of excessive heating in the winding. This phenomenon is presented through results of a comprehensive magnetic field study on two 4 pole, 659 MVA asymmetrically slotted rotor and 2 pole, 733 MVA standard rotor turbogenerators. From flux density and loss distribution curves, recommendations as to the size and location of these holes, to significantly reduce these losses are made."
"The Grounding of Gas Insulated Substations (GIS) presents several unique problems not encountered in the grounding, of conventional substations. For the purposes of this paper, Gas Insulated Substations are defined as high-voltage, compact, metal-enclosed minisubstations which are compressed gas insulated at maximum rated voltages of 72.5 kV and above. The metal enclosure is grounded and consists of the outer sheath for the substation equipment and the coaxial gas insulated bus. The maximum voltage developed on the grounded outer sheath during fault conditions is calculated using coupling techniques and a transformer equivalent circuit. By setting limits on the maximum outer sheath voltage to station ground, the maximum distance between grounding points can be determined for the safety of personnel in a Gas Insulated Substation."
"This paper records the experimental results on the implementation of optimal controllers for synchronous machines based on nonlinear and linear system models. First, a method is developed for synthesizing a closed - loop optimal control for the case of a non-linear machine model. The validity of this optimal control is then established by implementing it on a micro - machine connected to a short transmission line and driven by an armature-controlled d.c. motor. Comparison of test results with those of digital simulation demonstrate the practical usefulness of optimal controllers in improving synchronous machine transient response. Experimental results are presented to show that while optimal controllers based on a linear model perform quite well for small disturbances, those based on a nonlinear model yield a better response for large disturbances. Several other factors related to optimal control design, such as the improvement of transient response, effect of various parameters on optimal performance, coice of order for system model etc. are also discussed."
"A comprehensive set of tests were conducted to determine the parameters of the excitation system of a turbo-generator. Various test methods were investigated during preliminary tests on the isolated regulator. As a result of these, small-signal frequency response measurements were carried out on the excitation system with the generator on-line. In addition, the response of various generator and excitation variables were recorded following faults on the power system. From the frequency response tests and the fault recordings, small-, medium-, and large-signal models of the excitation system were proposed."
"This paper describes the development of a new static negative sequence relay for generator protection. This relay has a broader range of settings and greater sensitivity to provide protection for modern large generators as well as units in unattended stations, such as remote-controlled hydro and gas turbine peaking plants. An example is given of its application, in light of newly proposed ANSI standards."
"The load flow problem is formulated in linearized form in which complex notation is retained. Various criterion functions are proposed for optimal reactive power (VAr) siting, and the linear load flow results are used in a gradient scheme to affect the optimization. Matrix notation is used, and computational advantages are noted over existing VAr siting techniques; among these advantages are accuracy, computation speed, and convenient sub-optimal solution when some system busses are unavailable for VAr placement."
"The electric transmission system power flow equations bear a striking similarity to force-displacement characteristics of pin-joint structures such as electrical transmission towers. In this paper, the structural analog to the electric power system equations is made in vector-matrix terms and contemporary techniques are applied for rapid analysis and design of transmission towers. In particular, the linearized power flow technique and the Kron reduction technique for impedance matrix modification are applied in order to radically increase the speed of analysis of transmission tower structures. The increase in speed and the nature of the problem formulation allows structural design techniques in reasonable digital processing times."
"An Edison Electric Institute (EEI) - National Bureau of Standards (NBS) research project was conducted in order to determine how accurately the unit of energy (kilowatthour) is maintained in the electric utility laboratories, and to investigate methods of improving the transfer of the unit of energy. This paper discusses the establishment of a testing facility and the evaluation of energy transfer standards. Recommendations are given for the performing of interlaboratory tests (round-robins) and the use of special containers for shipping standards by commercial airlines."
"This bibliography lists the various publications dealing in whole or in part with the mechanism of lightning and the schemes which have been used to provide protection against lightning strokes for substations, lines, and structures. Both historical and present-day theory and practice are covered."
"This is a report of the Task Group on Line Loading and Strength for Transmission Line Structures of the Towers, Poles and Conductors Subcommittee, Subgroup 3, Structure Development, of the Transmission and Distribution Committee. The purpose of this report is to familiarize the industry with concrete pole structures and to provide a guide for design and manufacture of the structures. An appendix provides an example method for calculating ultimate moment capacity of a fully prestressed concrete section."
"This paper explains the main. cause of the formation of microvoids (1µm-several 10sµm) in the insulation of crosslinked polyethylene, and the effect of those on the electrial characteristics of cable. Crosslinked polyethylene cable is produced through the process of extruding, moulding, heating, crosslinking and cooling. Steam is usually used as the heating medium. The first cause of the formation of microvoids is the steam intruding into the insulation at the time of vulcanization, and the insulation of steam cured crosslinked polyethylene cable generally contains microvoids several µm in size and around 106per mm3in number. If a heating medium other than steam should be used, the number of voids can be reduced by around 104per mm3, but it is quite difficult to bring it down to zero. While cable breakdown voltage may scarcely be affected by the size and number of the microvoids at present concerning us, the dimension of bow tie tree induced by the microvoids is approximately proportional to the diameter of voids, and so efforts must be made to reduce the diameter of voids."
"The necessity for system damping and fault survival have imposed requirements on superconducting alternators not considered in earlier studies. These requirements impinge mostly on the rotor shielding system, and seem to indicate a two-component rotor damper/shield. Projections of machine size and performance indicate that even with the new requirements, superconducting machines retain their projected advantage over conventional machines."
"A frequency deviation transducer using solid-state circuitry has been developed. The device is based on digital - analogue technique and is suitable for continuous record of power system frequencies and governor application with a high order of accuracy. No initial adjustments are required and no reset problems are faced. Depending on application requirements, the transducer may be used alone for direct measurement or in combination with other control equipment for automatic load frequency control, excitation control, load shedding and in acceleration relay applications etc."
"Results of studies exploring the effects of early valve actuation on the stability of a nuclear station and a fossil-fired station are presented. The studies were performed on multimachine systems using a detailed representation of steam turbines. The sensitivity effects of the valve actuation times were investigated and the importance of such an investigation is demonstrated."
"In the stability analysis of power systems, the influence of the abrupt output change on the electromagnetic torque Temin the on-fault condition is conventionally neglected. A straight and rigorous method to derive the corresponding approximated expression of Tem, strictly based on the generally accepted Park-equations and known parameterratios, is presented. The resulting improvement in the accuracy of the calculations of the critical clearing time is shown to be highly significant."
"Four failures of large EHV auto-transformers on the AEP system are described. The failures were initiated by flashovers in the no-load tap changer during system faults. Investigations and tests attribute the flashovers to part-winding resonance. Test data is presented for various terminal conditions and wave shapes corresponding to system transient conditions. The relationship of these tests to ANSI standard dielectric tests is discussed. Corrective measures for existing transformers include arresters tied to an internal crossover connection and capacitor banks connected to the delta tertiary windings."
"The recent failures of four EHV auto-transformer no load tap changers is interpreted. The failures were a direct and immediate consequence of transmission line faults as far as 340 miles away. The related system transient behavior is analyzed, and the transformer response to these transients is presented on a quantitative basis. It is demonstrated for these transformers that the ANSI standard dielectric surges offer an inadequate test of winding insulation remote from the line terminals where significant winding resonance is known to occur. The extent of these test limitations to other transformers is discussed."
"Switching of three phase load currents with low power factors, such as encountered in arc furnace installations can result in a series of reignitions and clearings. Depending on the switch performance and system parameters the switching transients may involve one, two, or three phases. The effect of virtual current chopping which can lead to line to line overvoltages is described. The phenomena are explained for simplified conditions, more complex situations are handled by digital computer studies."
"The paper presents a method for recognizing the uncertain nature of generator forced outage rates as used in computing the popular reliability index of LOLP (expected number of days per period on which capacity is insufficient) for a single-area system by treating forced outage rates as random variables with specified mean and variance. An efficient method is presented for computing the variance of LOLP in addition to the mean. Monte Carlo simulation studies indicate that LOLP is approximately gamma distributed regardless of the distribution of generator forced outage rates. Hence, approximate confidence limits for LOLP can be obtained using the gamma distribution with parameters corresponding to the computed mean and variance of LOLP."
"Large magnets with superconductive windings could serve to perform a power system function analogous to pumped storage hydro. A conventional Graetz bridge converter as used in dc transmission provides an ideal interface between the three-phase power system and the superconductive magnet or inductor. Such Inductor-Converter or I-C units, when properly controlled, provide significant power system benefits. Power reversibility is achievable within a few cycles without switching. Power system electromechanical oscillations can be damped effectively. Computer studies reveal that this damping capability may be useful even with smaller inductor sizes when energy storage in large amounts is not the primary objective. In sizes greater than 1,000 MWh, economic studies show promise."
"This paper presents the results of a feasibility study of a technique for identifying dynamic equivalents of portions of a power system from measurements made only within a restricted Study System without intentional perturbation of the system. The Maximum Likelihood technique is used to identify parameter values for a specified equivalent structure which is suitable for direct use in standard transient stability programs. The identifier was tested using measurements from simulations tuned to match field measurements. The field measurements, identification algorithm, and program test results are described. The expected benefit of this technique is in overcoming a major block in the development of an on-line technique for the evaluation of transient stability contingencies by power system operators."
"This paper covers the design criteria for Diesel-Generators for Nuclear Power Plants. It deals with applicable standards, loading, design performance, and characteristics to be considered in the selection of diesel-generator set and its auxiliary system. This paper also discusses engineered safety features loads together with loss of power safe shutdown loads and their starting sequence, analysis of voltage and frequency response and the diesel-generator ability to start various load blocks successfully to meet the Reactor Emergency core cooling requirements."
"The minimization of an index of performance expressed as a measure of overvoltage has been shown to yield time vs resistance curves for optimal insertion resistance. The random pole closure on any part of the voltage wave has also been considered and the solution of the resulting Min-Max problem offers the \"best\" insertion resistor for the control of switching overvoltages."
"Reliable and efficient communications of speech and signal information is an integral part of power plant operation. This paper describes methods of achieving high communication system intelligibility in all power plant environments. Economic factors and desirable path redundancy are considered for both nuclear and fossil fueled plants."
"This paper reports with multiple techniques delineating complete sequence of events from the primary corona to the formation of the spark channel for large rod-to-plane air gaps with negative switching impulses. It is shown that starting with the primary corona the breakdown proceeds through the secondary corona and the intermittent appearance of the light flash to the final spark formation, qualitatively independent of the front time of applied impulses. The detailed analysis were made to each event, especially to the intermittent flash, with extremely high time-resolution techniques."
"This paper deals with the influence of unbalanced currents on the design and operation of large turbine generators. With the demand for electric power doubling every decade, generator ratings are growing very rapidly, and at the same time reliability and availability are becoming major considerations. It is necessary to raise the capability of unbalanced loading by introducing components that can reduce the eddy current loss of rotor surfaces, keeping the local temperature rise within a reasonable value, since the surface loss density increases with electromagnetic loading in large machines. Conclusions deduced from analysis, factory model tests, factory unbalanced current tests and operating experiences show num. erically that full-length amortisseurs, particularly those with several bars in the pole faces, are highly effective in reducing the surface temperature and in satisfying the required degree of reliability and availability in the unbalanced current operation of large generators."
"The stability region of a hydraulic turbine and the associated governor control is investigated based on a proven model for the case of a single hydraulic unit connected to an equivalent system. The analysis begins with the use of a very simple system. Additional factors are added in turn to illustrate the effects of each, until finally the complete model is in use. In addition to the establishment of stability boundaries, practical operating boundaries are also determined. In fact, these operating boundaries are a natural output of the method used to find the stability boundaries."
"The intent of this paper is to offer useful information to those who are designing or are about to begin operation of pumped storage installations for the first time. It describes Duke Power Company's design, checkout, and precomraercial operation techniques and experiences with Jocassee Pumped-Storage Station (Units 1 & 2 of an eventual 4 Unit Station). Particular emphasis is made on two methods of pump starts, Semi-synchronous and Reduced Voltage, including the control and monitoring equipment involved."
"This study evaluates the capability of a generating system to meet its load demand over an intermediate-term horizon with a well-defined schedule of planned outages. The evaluation considers the random nature of the future system capability and demand. The present study extends steady state Markov models of generating capacity in two ways: [1] Introduces more general, semi-Markov models of generating units. [2] Computes security measures which depend upon the transient behavior induced by the schedule of planned outages. The semi-Markov models are based on statistical analysis of the ten year outage history of four identical 200-MW coal-fired generating units. The transient behavior arises from knowledge of the start-up times of the units which have been on planned outage."
"In 1970, due to the developing interest in North America in gas insulated substations, the IEEE Substations Committee established Working Group 70.1 on Gas Insulated Substations. Interest in these substations has continued to grow since then and an increasing number of articles have been written on the subject each year. Working group 70.1 has therefore prepared this bibliography of most of the readily available English language literature on gas insulated substations. Articles are arranged in chronological order in one of three general categories: gas insulated substations, gas insulated transmission lines and dielectric properties of SF6 gas insulation. This bibliography was prepared by G.H. Hathaway, R. Matulic and P.R. Nannery for Working Group 70.1 on Gas Insulated Substations of the IEEE Substations Committee."
 "In the paper a generator protection As described which is capable of detecting earth leak-- ages in any point of the stator winding and deterioration of insulation over parts of the winding adjacent to the neutral point. The theoretical considerations in conjunction with the application or the protection have been dealt with in Paper 34-O1 of the 1972 session of CIGRE. In the present paper, after giving a description of the operating principle, an account of some recent results of development and experiments will be given."

"This paper describes the investigation and evaluation of relationships between loss-of-excitation/field (LOF) relaying and stability of a 595-MVA generator on the Detroit Edison system. Need for the formulation of a plan of action to promote a reliable application of LOF relays is made evident. Operating guidelines are suggested which will safeguard the generator and system from damage during unstable swings while avoiding inadvertent generator tripping during stable swings. In addition, an examination of operating characteristics of a loss-of-field relay in response to changes in voltage and frequency is presented."
"This paper presents the results of a study into the application and performance of the offset mho distance relay for the loss of excitation protection of synchronous generators. Included is information on the loss of excitation characteristics of modern generators, on relay performance during transient swings and low frequency disturbances and on generator protection."
 "The possibilities of generator damage and/or a cascading system outage due to generator loss of excitation are investigated. Load flow techniques are used to screen large systems for locations where a generator operating without excitation could endanger system reliability. It is shown that automatic protection using relays with up to two zones of protection and having time delays for each zone will reliably guard against the detrimental effects of loss of excitation in the system and synchronous machines."
"This paper describes a different approach to the design of power stabilizers for damping out tie-line power oscillations in power systems. The technique described in this paper was successfully applied at a generating station of the Saskatchewan Power Corporation System with the results from these tests included in the latter part of this paper. The technique can be applied directly to systems characterized by lightly damped oscillations and gives an explicit indication of the amount of improvement in system damping for different combinations of power stabilizer parameters. This procedure allows for a graphical approach to the design of power stabilizers and serves as a synthesis procedure when the design constraints are relaxed so that the speed stabilizer is required to provide an improvement in system damping."
"Previously reported wind tunnel dynamic tests on spring-supported models of transmission line conductors with crescent-shaped accumulations of ice, showed that the galloping instability of these models was significantly affected by turbulence in the air flow. The static aerodynamic coefficients of these models have now been determined in turbulent air flow, and a theoretical prediction made of the galloping instability. Good agreement has been obtained between this predicted performance and the previous dynamic tests. The method used for the prediction, and typical experimental data are presented in this paper."
"A theory for the solid-rotor induction machine is developed such that the finite width and thickness of the rotor as well as its saturation are taken into account. An axial-airgap disc-type motor is considered as an example, for which an equivalent circuit is developed, terminal characteristics are computed and compared with experimental results. The validity of the theory is thus demonstrated. Although the disc motor is used as an example, the theory is applicable to single-sided linear induction motors and other solid-rotor eddy-current motors."
 "The influence on DC electrical performance of SF6gas from small protrusions on electrode surfaces has been investigated experimentally in a system of moderate size over the pressure range from 1/2 to 15 atm. abs. The protrusions used were steel or aluminum spheres with 0.079cm radius or a rod 10 times higher than its tip radius of 0.039cm. Over the complete voltage range, 100 kV to 1500 kV, good agreement was found between measured values and those calculated using a simple ionization development model for discharge initiation. This simple model was applied to calculate the effect of other protrusion shapes. In each case when the product of gas pressure times protrusion height above a flat electrode exceeded 80 atm-microns their presence decreased the breakdown stress. Scanning microscope views of the sphere tips after sparking showed microscopic protrusions which account for the deterioration found after the first spark."
"The calculation of induced voltages and short-circuit currents on people is an important step for the determination of tolerable levels of the electrostatic fields of UHV power transmission lines. Formulae for the induced short-circuit current of a hemisphere and a half-cylinder on the ground are derived in this paper. A shape factor, defined as the ratio of the equivalent charge collecting area, S, to an object's projected area on the ground, is discussed. The short-circuit current, Isc, is obtained from the ground-level voltage gradient, Eg, by means of the equation Isc= J ω ε EgS Different models for predicting the electrostatic induction are compared in the case of a rectangular solid. In order to show how calculations of Iscmay be made for more complicated shapes, a comparison of the results obtained with various approximations is presented."
"The generator maintenance scheduling problem is formulated as a 0-1 integer linear program. Although previous papers have considered a rigorous integer programming approach intractable, an algorithm of this type is developed which (1) is guaranteed to find a schedule satisfying problem constraints, if one exists; (2) is guaranteed to find the optimal feasible schedules; and (3) will accept any of an important class of optimality criteria, not just levelness of reserve. Particular attention is directed to a new criterion incorporating dollar costs/benefits incurred by delaying or advancing maintenance on a unit."
"This paper demonstrates the extent by which a relatively small number of engineering educators have dominated the trend of engineering education and its accreditation system, for many years, from every influencing vantage point. It explores the question of why practicing engineers from industry-the principal user of engineering graduates-do not want to or cannot get themselves involved more effectively in engineering education and accreditation. The paper is based on data garnered by analyzing all ECPD annual reports since 1933, as well as, many major engineering education papers and studies related to this subject. The discussion and conclusions are timely especially in view of the heated debates presently going on regarding graduate engineering accreditation."
"Tan δ (dissipation factor)data on Cable System B is updated to include the full 2-year 500/550 kV test program at Waltz Mill and the 10-month 765/800 kV extended test program. This data is analyzed, demonstrating no change with time of tan δ for the system. Particular attention is paid to the paper splice, which exhibits a thermoelectric stability limitation at the 765/800 kV level. The outstanding performance of the PP/C splice is emphasized. Consideration of the operation of a very highly stressed oil impregnated paper insulation HPOF pipe system at 765 kV is suggested, including potential single circuit transmission capacity calculations."
"A comprehensive program for the comparison of computed values of the magnetic fields within electric machines with the actual fields is being developed. The experimental equipment, a fully instrumented synchronous motor, is described together with measurements of the open-circuit radial component of the airgap field. Comparison of the latter with computed values indicates that the predicted values are accurate up to about twice the rated excitation."
"This paper covers installation procedures and testing methods of a 138kV SF6 gas insulated station coupled to 117.5m (385ft) and 367m (1204ft) SF6 gas insulated transmission line exits. Three factors guided American Electric Power Service Corporation in selecting its first SF6 gas insulated station and line exits. These were: available space for expansion of facilities at Indiana & Michigan Electric Company's East Side Station in South Bend, Indiana, aesthetic considerations, and the desire to be involved with this new technology and thus gain needed experience."
"This paper reviews some of the problems related to the evaluation of substation and switching station reliability and introduces an improved computing method. In particular, it describes a computer program which, from basic data only, classifies all momentary interruptions according to the time of switching required to restore service. The method is based on a Failure Mode and Effect Analysis and is illustrated by the analysis of a practical substation configuration."
"This paper discusses the installation of three Detroit Edison 120kV gas insulated substations - Caniff, Midtown and Cato. These substations, all located in Detroit, were installed between October 1972 and June 1973. Discussion topics include the shipment, foundation, assembly and wiring of metal enclosed components, SF6gas processing and high voltage field testing."
"This paper presents a brief summary of a Working Group report in which reviews of ten Economy-Security functions appear."
"By using the unconditional probability of flashover as a comparative parameter, it is shown that a Gaussian approximation to the distribution of switching overvoltages is adequate for purposes of transmission line design."
"This paper presents a numerical approach useful for determining the modes of transient response of a synchronous generator. The approach is based upon the Floquet theory of periodic time-variable systems. A computer algorithm for system transition matrix eigenvalue analysis is described and applied to a three-phase synchronous machine."
"This paper takes the view that the predominant problem of load frequency control (LFC) resides in the low frequency domain assosiated with bulk generation change and which is dominated by limited generation response capability. In this setting LFC is formulated as a tracking problem in which energy source dynamics and load following play a central role. It is shown how load prediction and coordination of area generation in a multi-area interconnection can effectively improve the regulation of inter-area power flows."
"Probability methods have been used to investigate the effect of the outage of key transmission lines on the reliability of an interconnected power system. The results have been expressed as the probability of loss of import capability due to loss of such key lines. A study technique is developed that relates the reliability of the simultaneous interchange capability (SIC) to a given interconnected system during periods when intercompany transfers are required. Application of the study technique to a typical system demonstrates the sensitivity of the method to various forced outage rates and to the number of days involving heavy transmission loading."
"Tests have been made of the short-circuit stresses on 145 kV busbar systems with flexible conductors. The influence of different parameters has been studied such as span length, sag, conductor type, conductor spacing, spring effect in towers etc. Currents of 20-50 kArmsand short-circuit times 0,1-0,5 s have been studied. The results have been compared with results from manual and computer calculations."
"The increased use of metallic communication circuits in electric substations requires that adequate protection be provided for personnel and equipment during fault conditions. The design of such protection requires a knowledge of the behavior of ground systems, ground rise calculations, and communication techniques. This paper discusses the problem in three parts: I. A development of the characteristics of and measurement techniques for groundbeds and a discussion of how interconnections affect the measurement problem. A new measurement technique is developed which is capable of accurately measuring the resistive part of the grounding impedance of interconnected groundbeds. II. A discussion of the proper use of fault study and ground resistance information for the calculation of ground potential rise. III. A description of the metallic communication circuit protection techniques used by Northern States Power Company."
"Lightning protection studies of transmission lines have revealed the limitations of conventional shielding practice for both high-voltage lines and stations. A new technique for station shielding design was developed replacing the former approach of relying on an ill-defined relationship between shielding angle and station exposure. This new technique is particularly suited to assessment of overhead shielding systems for large stations with high reliability requirements; it also permits evaluation of the effectiveness of shielding structures meeting aesthetic considersations."
"This paper describes a calculational technique developed to calculate the eddy current losses (radial flux losses) induced in the stator conductors of round rotor synchronous generators operating at any desired conditions. Determination of these losses requires accurate modeling of the nonlinear magnetic circuits of the generator in order to obtain the magnetic field distribution in the generator under load. This type of modeling has been done in the past by the use of extensive methematical analog grids which model, with discrete elements, the magnetic response of a cross section of the entire generator. The solution of these grids is often cumbersome and is usually so expensive from the standpoint of computer costs, that the calculational methods are not practical for use as an everyday engineering tool. The analysis described in this paper combines the use of vector potential grid modeling methods with a battery of carefully chosen simplifying assumptions. The result is a calculational technique which is economical and practical enough for widespread use by the machine designer as he explores new designs. The method produces results which agree extremely well with both shop tests on synchronous generators and with the results of more cumbersome computer programs."
"Many generating station 480-volt auxiliary power systems employ a WYE distribution system with the source neutral solidly grounded. Because of the arcing nature of some ground faults, the ground fault currents developed on these systems are often too low to operate phase overcurrent protective devices. As WYE systems became more popular, a more sophisticated approach to protection was needed, resulting in the development of many new protective devices for ground fault protection. This paper reviews the application of such ground fault protective devices for use in 480-volt auxiliary power systems of generating stations. In addition, some modifications to existing products are suggested."
"Violent rupture of distribution transformers has occurred with increasing frequency in recent years. The problem appears greatest with pole-type units at locations with high available short-circuit currents. This paper concerns the rupture of pole-type distribution transformers subjected to internal, submerged, arcing faults of high current magnitude. An analysis of a probable rupture process and tests of faulted transformers were used to obtain a simple semi-empirical equation for the internal transformer pressure rise. Limiting the I2t during the fault with current limiting fuses is shown to be a practical means of minimizing the probability of transformer rupture."
"Calculation of the capacitance to ground, as well as of the capacitance between objects of various shapes is a problem occurring frequently in high voltage engineering. Simple methods do not exist, however, for such calculations even in the case of some basic electrode configurations. Although general purpose computer programs may have been developed for most of the configurations, their availability is rather limited, and the data preparation often cumbersome. Accurate computer calculations of the capacitance to ground have been made for a large number of electrode configurations. The results are presented graphically in a normalized form, and should permit a rapid and precise determination of capacitances for most practical electrode arrangements. Furthermore, some simple equations have been developed which permit an approximate, but often sufficiently accurate, evaluation of the capacitances by hand calculations. It is believed that both the accurate graphs and the simple equations would be of great practical value, especially to high voltage engineers."
"Radio interference generated due to corona on transmission line conductors and hardware causes a deterioration in the quality of radio reception in the vicinity of the line, especially in the AM broadcast frequency band. It is therefore necessary, from the point of view of an acceptable line design, to define allowable limits to the RI. From a study of the characteristics of RI from transmission lines and of the factors influencing the quality of AM radio reception, a number of parameters which would best describe the influence of RI on radio reception are identified. On the basis of this study, an approach is suggested in the paper for defining tolerable limits for RI from high voltage transmission lines."
"The region of the front of a switching impulse on which the breakdown probability of a gap depends (the so-called active region) is determined by testing with a 4-m rod-plane gap stressed by bumped impulses. The experimental results show that the lower limit of the active region is rather a given voltage than a percentage of the amplitude of the impulse. The extent of this region depends on the form of the electrode, the gap clearance and the voltage level, and it is this which determines the breakdown probability corresponding to the particular impulse. Breakdown probability distributions in the form of an inverted S are explained in terms of the active region and its lower limit."
"If a through fault causes overheating of a superconducting cable, the cable cannot be used until the normal operating temperature is re-established. Since this could take more than a day, the cable must be designed so that the largest through fault expected will not overheat the cable system. This paper describes both a theoretical analysis of the behavior of a rigid coaxial ac superconducting cable system during and following a through fault as well as the theoretical and experimental verification of the ability of this design to continue to deliver power following a through fault."
"Design considerations are given for selection of electrical features as required for addition of mechanical-draft-type cooling towers at an existing multiunit nuclear generating station. Environmental and nuclear safety problems were solved economically by use of enclosed 161-kV power connections, oil-filled transformers, supervisory-type control, and unique schemes for redundancy to minimize need for Class 1E construction."
"Electrode surface roughness can cause a large reduction of the threshold for break down in SF6insulated apparatus. This effect is discussed by applying the streamer theory of breakdown to the microscopic field regions associated with surface roughness. A quantitative relation is derived between the practical breakdown threshold and gas pressure times maximum surface roughness."
"This paper discusses TVA's practices in the design of ac auxiliary power distribution systems of large thermal generating plants. Its scope is limited to the primary portions of the system, including the station service transformers which step down the main generator voltage or switchyard voltage, and the switchgear and buses which distribute power from the secondaries of these transformers. Single-line diagrams of one fossil and two nuclear plants are presented. The change from systems designed with common startup and emergency supplies to a system which provides startup power from the main transformer with independent alternate offsite power sources is discussed."
"Measurements made immediately after shut-down of a transformer short-circuit temperature rise test contain information relating to winding temperatures and winding oil temperatures. These quantities cannot be measured directly in any practicable manner. As customarily made and analysed, the shut-down measurements may not be adequate for the purpose of revealing this information accurately enough to justify (for example) rating transformers by hot-spot winding temperature instead of average winding temperature. Details are given of improved methods of measurement and analysis which yield more reliable values of transformer thermal characteristics."
"The paper deals with different aspects of insulator contamination in the desert, based on extensive laboratory tests and field experience with 500 kV transmission line insulators. It is shown that the build-up of the contamination layer in the desert is a gradual and slow process. Light sand particles are shown to be the major contamination source. A special technique is described to investigate the interaction between the contamination layer and atmospheric humidity. Flashover tests with natural and artificial contamination proved the necessity of detailed evaluation of dispersion and stressed the role played by the inert binder of the contaminant. Statistical methods for predicting insulator performance are presented and several factors of practical significance to line insulator selection in the desert are analyzed."
"The self-excited oscillations are likely to occur in highly series compensated transmission lines having low resistance, particularly in long-distance bulk-power EHV transmission lines. This paper proposes a measure to suppress the self-excited oscillations in which the excitation of a synchronous machine is controlled by a reactive power (Q) signal. This paper also discusses the theoretical analyses of this suppression and the results of testing using a small generator."
"This paper relates to on-line security assessment and determination of optimal preventive measures of power system, which the authors have developed by using two methods, digital and digital-analog hybrid. The description includes the power system of the Tokyo Electric Power Co., Inc. (TEPCO) for the security assessment; the software configuration for the on-line security assessment; fast calculating methods for the assessment, with emphasis on the study of transient stability; methods for determinating optimal preventive measures to improve transient stability; performance test of the digital method for an actual bulk power system; and a model hybrid security monitoring system for a comparatively small power system and its performance test."
"This and a companion paper deal with the study of a power synchro system with shunt connected rotor resistances, using generalized machine theory. The value of this approach in studying such systems was effectively demonstrated in two previous papers [1], [2]. In this paper, the previous work is reviewed and the analytical model developed for the system herein considered. The system performance equations, developed on a suitable reference frame are used in their non-linear form and are also linearized by Taylor series expansion, permitting the study of dynamic performance by the well developed methods of linear system analysis for small perturbations about a quiescent operating point. The model parameters for an actual system are determined experimentally. Steady-state performance of the system, for different values of the external resistance is investigated theoretically and the model verified experimentally. In the companion paper, the effect of system parameters and drives on the dynamic performance is investigated using eigenvalue analysis for small perturbation studies, and by simulating the system using the Continuous System Modeling Program for small and large disturbances. Experimental results are presented to establish the validity of the Model and the theoretical studies. It is hoped that these papers will provide a better understanding of this simple and effective system."
"In the companion paper, the general model of a power synchro system with shunt connected rotor resistances is developed and steady-state analysis outlined. In this paper dynamic behaviour of such a system is examined using eigenvalue analysis as well as by simulation of the system non linear equations. The effect of the system parameters on stability is investigated. The system is simulated using the System 360/Continous System Modeling Program [1] for different dynamic situations. Experimental results on an actual system corresponding to the theoretical simulation are presented. A comparison is made between the performance predicted from the nonlinear and linearized equations of the system for different amounts of torque disturbances. It is hoped that the analysis presented together with the experimental results will give a better insight into the operation of such systems."
"A new line of high voltage vacuum power circuit breakers is being developed for 121 kV and above and will use the new vacuum interrupter module presented in a companion paper3. The first ratings in production will be 242 kV with interrupting capabilities of 40,000 amperes, followed by breakers rated 50,000 amperes; both of these will have continuous current ratings of 2000 and 3000 amperes. This paper departs from normal practice by submitting the new vacuum circuit breaker design concepts prior to manufacture. A future paper on the breaker testing program and test results will be submitted to the Institute. The breakers will be dead tank design and use SF6gas only for insulation purposes. The interrupter contacts are to be mechanically driven by charged-spring type operating mechanisms. The breakers will be supplied for conventional outdoor switchyards and for high voltage gas-insulated station equipments."
"Isothermal tests of a pipe type cable system were made in both the laminar and turbulent flow regimes. Transition to turbulent flow occurs at much lower Reynolds number than for bare pipes. The flow resistence is strongly influenced by skid wire geometry in the turbulent region and by cable configuration in the laminar region. Previous theoretical predictions for flow resistence in the laminar region are in error by twenty percent."
"This paper describes the development, validation and use of a non-linear dynamic model developed for the study of automatic generation control and economic dispatch structures within a large multi-company interconnected electric power system. The model constitutes a unique tool for the realistic evaluation of the dynamic performance of newly developed system control and dispatch strategies. The improvements obtainable with these strategies and the determination of sufficient response reserves are demonstrated."
"The system and transformer characteristics which can result in overvoltages and ferroresonance when energizing grounded-wye/ grounded-wye distribution transformers from a remote location with single-pole switches are defined. A qualitative analysis of a system typical of those installed today is presented to show how the overvoltages can occur during single-pole switching. Full-scale laboratory tests were conducted to determine maximum overvoltages and obtain a better understanding of the phenomenon. The results show that distinct responses occur during the single-pole energization, and ferroresonance can occur contrary to statements appearing in many references."
"A model for hourly load (hourly*energy consumption) forecasting is developed. The method is based on using the linear estimation theory to obtain four different prediction models for the load at a particular hour corresponding to the four correlation periods, namely an hour*, a day, a week and a year. The four predicted values with their respective variances are combined optimally to obtain a composite forecast for the hour. The holiday forecasts are improved by selectively rejecting one or more of these four predicted values. Actual data from the Hydro-Quebec system load file for the period of September 28, 1969 to September 26, 1971, is used as data for identification of the model. The load forecasts for the period of September 27, 1971 to September 26, 1972 are compared with the loads actually realized during the same period."
"Vacuum insulation for high voltage power apparatus is becoming more acceptable. However, there is very little comprehensive data available for the insulation performance of vacuum gaps under 60Hz a.c. voltage stress. The authors report the result of a systematic study comparing the behaviour of a vacuum insulated gap under d.c. and 60Hz a.c. voltage stress. It is concluded that the behaviour of a vacuum gap is not significantly different for the different types of voltage stress except in the initial prebreakdown phase."
"The feasibility of a series connection of stations in a multiterminal HVDC transmission system is demonstrated. Techniques were developed to control this system, and the operation of the system was studied on a large power system simulator. The performance of the system was shown to be similar to conventional point to point systems with most control functions being carried out by local controls. An overall system control is shown to be necessary only for optimizing load distributions. Given adequate tap changer ranges on the converter transformers the increase in valve damping and system reactive power requirements are shown to be moderate. The series connected multitermimal system is shown to have a number of advantages over the alternative parallel connected system for certain applications."
"The results of the subsynchronous resonance test conducted on the number 2 turbine-generator at the Southern California Edison Company Mohave Generating Station are presented and discussed. Comparisons are made between measured and calculated torsional natural frequencies and mode shapes, and the damping associated with each torsional mode stimulated is presented at various loads. In addition, the methods of stimulating the mechanical torsionals of the turbine-generator set are discussed along with a description of the instrumention system that was used to obtain the data."
"This paper describes a new measuring method of the current zero phenomena of the circuit breaker with use of vacuum interrupter connected in parallel to the high resistance coaxial shunt. This method is applicable for the test circuit up to 50kA. The process is less effected by the electromagnetic induction offering a much accurate results. The measurements are conducted to obtain the V-A relation around current zero region of model SF6circuit breakers. The investigations on the transient time of the arc resistance, arc time constant and arc energy show that the arc time constant cannot be treated as a constant as the Mayr's equation is dealt."

"The thesis of this paper is that the long-range solution to the energy woes of the world does not lie in any one particular approach and that several avenues should be explored simultaneously, with particular emphasis on the exploitation of solar energy in its various manifestations such as heat, winds, tides, and ocean thermal gradients. Research and development over the past thirteen years at Oklahoma State University has resulted in the evolution of several components required to engineer a continuous duty power system running on nonexpendable energy sources, namely the sun and the wind. This paper presents the system and discusses its applicability to the energy systems of the future."

This paper is a study of 345kV field data, generated by a pulse test circuit, which develops inherent characteristics for the \"bare\" line. The modifying effects of terminal equipment on the shape of the saw-tooth component are demonstrated experimentally and theoretically. Test results are compared with present ANSI Standard requirements to verify the application."

"Forces that influenced engineering education are briefly discussed to demonstrate their effect on electric power engineering courses. Estimates of manpower needs for the power industry in the next decade are presented realistically. Observations about the sources from whence these men and women will come are made. Finally some suggestions are given for required courses in electric power at the undergraduate level; and for those subjects which are considered important in graduate schools. The power industry is urged to show concern for engineering and engineering technology education, career guidance for young people and proper utilization of manpower."
"Established harmonic restraint differential relay concepts have been enlarged upon to provide a new static multiple-winding transformer differential relay. The resulting design includes simplification of the frequency selective circuits and new techniques for rapidly determining the harmonic content of the applied currents. The relay is shown to have improved sensitivity, to be responsive to internal transformer winding faults in less than two cycles, and to the more severe type of fault in less than one cycle. Full security against inrush currents and overexcitation as well as to external faults is demonstrated. Poor performance of current transformers is shown not to adversely affect either the security or dependability of the relay. Heavy current test results are presented which confirm the relay principles."
"Power system static state estimators usually employ more measurements than the minimum number necessary to completely define the state of the system. This paper solves the problem of determining the best measurement to add to a given set. This is done by showing that the poorest observability is in the direction of the eigenvector associated with the smallest eigenvalue of an observability matrix. Added new measurements in this direction are shown to improve observability and the best possible observability is shown to be where all the eigenvalues of the observability matrix are equal. The addition of measurements for determining the static state of a power system should improve observability. The technique for applying this concept to a power system is illustrated by a numerical example. The observability matrix and the smallest eigenvalues are found and the measurement to be added is determined by examining the components of the associated eigenvector. The improvement of this measurement over any other is verified by use of the Kalman filter."
"A new algebraic expression has been established for the critical sparkover voltage (CSOV) afair insulation submitted to positive switching impulses. By using the concept of the gap factor, the expression is found to be valid for all practical gap configurations in the distance range 1 to at least 30 m. Based on these considerations, an absolute limit of 2.4 MV is foreseen for the rated voltage of AC systems. Sparkover voltages under A.C. or lightning impulses are also predictable. Complementary investigations concerning the physics of discharge are needed for further improvements."
"An investigation was conducted to determine the response of various high voltage cable oils to cryogenic temperatures. Typical cooling and thawing curves were developed, through experimentation, for Sun Oil Company #4 Cable Oil and Cosden Low Viscosity Polybutene Oil under various initial and boundary conditions. During the course of this research, the freeze breakup and the possibility of cable damaging piston effects were also studied. Two theoretical approaches were developed to describe the freezing process observed during detailed experiments. Calculations were made and comparisons with actual measured high pressure freeze times discussed. As a result, an optimum freeze method was developed utilizing a liquid nitrogen bath in contact with the surface of the cable pipe."
"The requirements for seismic qualification of Class 1E equipment have been continually evolving for the past several years. 1 Periodically, this evolution arrives at a plateau of such significance that the decision to evaluate the equipment at that level is worth the investment of material, time and money. The IEEE Std. 344-1971, having currently undergone working group revision to Draft Rev. 3, is a broad general document. This paper delineates these general requirements for a specific product, in this case switchgear."
"Exhibiting essentially zero resistivity at high current densities and large magnetic fields, modern superconducting materials offer intriguing possibilities in power engineering. However, in order to utilize this property in any large scale application, the superconductor must be stable during fault and overload transients in the total system. In order to know whether the superconductor itself is stable, one must understand and control the detailed mechanisms of magnetic flux motion which occur in the material. Such flux motion will give rise to a non-zero resistivity and hence will always involve heat generation, which in turn will perturb the low temperature environment necessary to sustain superconductivity. This paper discusses the essential differences between superconductors and ordinary conductors; the control of heat generation resulting from magnetic flux motion necessary to insure that the superconductor is stable; and some experiments on models of dc superconducting transmission cables which test the theoretical assumptions."

Criteria for evaluating fuse performance is suggested."
"This report presents the results of a survey of electric service companies to determine the pressure relief venting reguirements for a failed surge arrester. Users were asked to supply the maximum and majority fault current values and time durations for present and future installations. An analysis of these results indicates that there is a need to increase pressure relief test current values in certain areas."
"The latest of a series of classified lists of power system relay references, begun in 1927, is presented.

"This paper presents the special problems associated with audible noise from corona on high voltage power lines. Human response to this noise source is examined in the context of requirements for special noise measuring methods and instrumentation and considering existing and proposed legislation for noise control in various countries. The need for a new and more realistic evaluation by regulatory bodies and utilities, of transmission line noise - and its effects on individuals and communities - is stressed."
"The performance of brushless, two-phase, heteropolar inductor generators supplying dc loads through bridge rectifiers is improved by means of a compensating scheme employing current-feedback and stationary damper current-loops. Armature reaction upon unconstrained field current in the uncompensated generator is initially investigated. Then several feedback circuits are examined. Accurate solutions for output currents are obtained by the numerical integrations of state variable equations representing up to five circuits with time-varying inductances and rectifiers. Test results on an experimental machine are reported for several compensation methods."
"Approximate formulae are developed for predicting overhead transmission line electrostatic effects. These formulae, which are based on numerous computer simulations, allow slide rule calculations of sufficient accuracy for preliminary design work. Measures to reduce electrostatic effects, such as increasing conductor height or erecting shield wires are compared. Shield wires are found to be quite effective."
"The application of a high-voltage alternating-current-comparator capacitance bridge to the measurement of the short circuit load losses of large three phase power transformers at rated current is described. Input of the transformer current to the bridge is provided through a 1000/1 ratio two-stage current transformer with a single turn primary winding Insulated for 50 kilovolts. Voltage input is provided through a loss-free gas dielectric capacitor which serves as the reference. Measurements on typical transformers ranging in size from 450 MVA to 750 MVA; with currents from 600 to 2100 amperes and short-clrcuit power factors from one percent to four percent, are discussed. Comparisons to appropriately corrected wattmeter measurements (aided by low-loss capacitors connected in parallel with the transformer) indicate an overall agreement of better than one percent."
"The paper constitutes a systematic investigation into the calculation and measurement of electromagnetic shielding effectiveness of high voltage laboratories. Both electromagnetic field and interference measurements were carried out to assess the shielding effectiveness of the UHV hall of Hydro-Quebec Institute of Research. While satisfactory shielding was obtained below 1 MHz, the measurements emphasized the deteriorating influence of seams and corners and revealed a considerable decline in shielding quality above a few MHz. A circuit approach is used to deduce new formulae for computing shielding effectiveness. Furthermore, new expressions are deduced for the increase in the equivalent resistance of a shielded enclosure due to non-uniform distribution of the circulating currents caused by intermittent bonding. A separate analysis is given for the shielding effectiveness above 1 MHz where in an UHV laboratory the dimensions of the enclosure approach the wave-length of the disturbing field. Considering the complex nature of the problem, agreement between theory and measurements is satisfactory."
"A method is described for obtaining dynamic solutions for the electrical and mechanical transients that accompany balanced or unbalanced faults on an isolated synchronous generator. The method is illustrated with a system containing a prime mover plus governor, synchronous generator, manual or automatic voltage regulation, and reclosing feeder circuit breaker. A combination of abc and Odq variables is employed in the interest of simplicity and economy in computation."
"This paper presents a technique that simulates dispatch actions, such as, changing transformer and phase shifter tap settings and changing voltage magnitudes at voltage controlled buses in a power system. The changes of power injection at one or two system buses, which would simulate the required dispatch action, are calculated using the sensitivity matrix of the basic system state. The real and reactive power flowing in all the system elements and voltages at all the system buses are then computed. The proposed technique has been applied to the interconnected Saskatchewan Power Corporation and Manitoba Hydro systems and to the 118 bus IEEE test system. The power flows and bus voltages calculated by the proposed technique are compared with those obtained from the Newton Raphson load flows."
"This paper presents an algorithm that improves steady state security of a power system. An objective function which includes power flows in the overloaded system elements and bus voltages that exceed the permissible limits is formulated. Weighting factors, obtained from the magnitudes and frequencies of the violations, are also used in this function. An optimal combination of controlling variables, such as voltage magnitudes at generator buses, real power generation, transformer and phase shifter tap settings, is determined by minimizing the objective function. Instead of the non-linear load flow equations, sensitivity analysis approach has been used to reduce computation time and effort. This technique has been applied to a 6 bus model and a 26 bus version of the Saskatchewan Power Corporation transmission system; and some of the more interesting results are presented."
"The increase in ratings of the largest generating units being placed in service continues to provide increasing challenges to the designers of large power generation equipment. These challenges have been met with design innovations in large steam turbinedriven generators resulting in a four fold increase in output in the past two decades, making possible the shipment of fully assembled generator stators in the largest ratings. The effects of increased power density on generator component design features and performance characteristics are described, and it is shown that proven design concepts supported by suitable monitoring devices have provided generators for the electric utility industry with excellent reliability and operating performance."
"There exists substantial interest to produce a low-cost high-performance solid-state EHV current transducer possessing both compactness and low complexity. A number of incentives have not only prompted in the past, but are responsible for current research and development effort throughout the world. In general, these incentives encompass both the limiting cost of conventional means at high voltage and the much desired interfacing advantages to be realized with modern solid-state systems. An optically isolated system utilizing a novel electronic modulation scheme will be described. The approach is realized through a feedback-controlled encoding system. This technique performs a comparison between the actual current being monitored and its encoded representation. Differences resulting from components or circuitry drift, for example, are automatically corrected on a continuous basis. This feedback approach, therefore, permits substantial reduction in both component specification and circuit complexity while providing excellent linearity and accuracy. The resultant high-performance system possesses both simplicity in design and decidedly advantageous interfacing properties with solid-state controls at, or below, EHV levels."
"A fast response detecting method of mean value of power system quantities such as, voltage, current, power, torque angle and shaft speed deviation is proposed. The detected value, which is linearly proportional to the input signal, represents the mean value of each half cycle of the input signal that is held as a dc voltage as soon as that half cycle is over. The detection is stable against the random noise included in the signal, and does not have drooping characteristic."
"This paper presents a new nonlinear observer (extended linear observer) which estimates the transient state of power system. The transient state of the power system is represented as a continuous time nonlinear differential equation and observation of output is obtained as a discretized value at every cycle of system frequency by using the mean value detecting circuit device. The nonlinear differential equation of state is discretized at each observation instant by Taylor expansion, and then the theory of discrete linear observers is applied to the discretized system. Digital computer simulation confirms that the observer estimates the state successfully not only in the case of hunting but also in step-out transient state of a synchronous machine."
"This paper describes the capabilities and mathematical basis of an advanced fault analysis program. This program handles simultaneous unbalanced fault analysis with detailed treatment of shunt branches, off-nominal transformers, and loading conditions as given by a base case load flow solution. Provision is made for large groups of branches with common mutual coupling. The program uses the diakoptic (piecewise) solution method to allow each sequence network to be handled independently, even though they are effectively interconnected by unbalanced faults. Efficient computer implementation is based on the optimally ordered triangular factorization of the individual sequence admittance matrices within the diakoptic procedure, and an efficient iterative method of handling mutual couplings."
"The manner in which the values of the various resonance frequencies of stators vary with changes in the length of stator-core, core thickness, frame thickness and frame material is investigated in this paper. The encased construction of stators, which is commonly used these days, is adopted for carrying out the investigations. The present study is of a general nature and is applicable to small and medium machines as well as to large machines. The investigations are not confined to the lowest resonance frequency associated with a given mode, but all the other important resonance frequencies associated with that mode are considered. In the course of the study, an attempt is made to give physical interpretation of the results."
"A new arrangement for synthetic testing of switchgear has been developed and verified at high power levels. The new procedure allows the transient recovery conditions to be selected independently of the injection frequency and will therefore make it possible to carry out the full range of tests covered in the recently published IEC and ANSI standards. Circuit configurations are given to meet specific test conditions, and a consideration has been given to questions of breaker interaction. A method of assessing circuit performance in the face of strong interaction is proposed."
"This paper describes the electrical design features of the Mt. Elbert Pumped-Storage Powerplant, with emphasis on the use of a static starting method for starting the unit in the motor direction.

"The application of a method of predicting the field strengths from mobile radio base station transmitters and in radio links is presented, and the extension of the method to facilitate frequency assignment is outlined. The topographic data for a country are stored in a computer and programs are provided which predict the signal levels produced by a specific transmitter at points spaced 0.5 km apart. A further program enables a plotter to be used to derive signal level contours which can be overlaid on a map. The field strength prediction method is proving valuable in the siting of VHF base stations, in the reduction of field testing required for mobile systems, and in the study of possible areas of cochannel interference. It has also been extended to effect path calculations for point-to-point radio links. An extension of the cochannel interference study in which channel assignments are made by a logical procedure so as to maintain co-channel interference below some chosen level while making the minimum demands on the spectrum is outlined. The method described has potential applications in national frequency planning."
"High capacity personal rapid transit (HCPRT) is a system concept which utilizes small, 4 to 6 passenger, vehicles at very short headways on exclusive guideway networks. The automatic operation of small vehicles at headways of 1 s or less presents a major technical problem which is amenable to a combination of design approaches. This paper explores the effect of basic parameters such as vehicle length, reaction time, emergency and failed vehicle deceleration rates, and emergency jerk rate on potential minimum operating headway. The results of this analysis are then discussed in the context of five HCPRT programs."

"A method of monitoring the quality of combustion in spark ignition gasoline engines using the spark plug's center electrode as a plasma probe is presented. Due to the ionized species remaining in the burned gases after combustion, a current is induced in a network attached to the spark plug's center electrode. The time dependence of this induced current is shown to correlate with the presence or absence and the time of occurance of the pressure component due to combustion in pressure transducer signals recorded simultaneously. Based on these correlations, three types of burns could be recognized from plasma probe signals: good burns, slow burns, and misfires. The specific correlation between the absence of a pressure component due to combustion and a corresponding absence of a plasma probe signal was used to form the basis for the operation of a one-channel engine misfire monitoring circuit."
"Short whips (monopoles) are often used on vehicles when a quarter wavelength is too long. It is common knowledge that a loading coil located in series with the whip improves narrow band performance. This series inductive loading of monopole (dipole) antennas is analyzed by a piecewise sinusoidal moment method. When loaded to resonance, the current rises from the feed value to a peak slightly beyond the load point with decay to zero at the end. Radiation resistance improvement factors as large as 5 have been calculated. The resonant loading reactance is shown to vary inversely with the antenna length for most lengths. Efficiency varies slowly with load point and peaks at roughly 0.4 (of the whip length) from the feed in contrast to earlier approximate theory that predicted higher efficiency for loads farther out toward the end. The curves allow a tradeoff between slightly reduced efficiency and larger input resistance (to allow easier matching) to be made. For this case, a 2/3 loading point may be a good compromise. The length for which efficiency is 50 percent is a useful design guide. This length varies slowly with Q and h/a and is in the range 0.06 to 0.09λ. Thus shorter monopoles will have low efficiency. Extensive graphical data are presented."

"An alternative method of speed detection is presented based on the Doppler effect in vehicular noise. A procedure is developed to correlate the noise frequency spectrum as the vehicle approaches an observer with the spectrum as it moves away. Limitations of the technique are evaluated using empirical data obtained under typical traffic conditions. These results demonstrate that the Doppler shift can be extracted from automotive noise and related to the vehicle's speed. Although sources of inaccuracy are significant at lower speeds, a resolution of ±5 percent was easily achieved at 60 mph. Such a technique may be found useful in large scale traffic speed and density monitoring systems."

Experiments verified the capability of the system to identify one object from another, even for a multiple object environment. An analytical model was developed that describes the Fresnel region scattering characteristics of simple objects."
"The design of a mobile or portable radio communications system requires the consideration of a number of unique engineering factors which do not necessarily apply to the design of a fixed, or point-to-point system. The design procedure is a combination of theoretical and empirical methods, which when taken with measured data, produce a system design meeting the required specifications. This paper will treat that portion of the system design pertaining to radio frequency propagation and system coverage. It stresses a realistic measurement program which will provide coverage data in support of the system design."

"Fading due to multipath propagation is a serious problem in mobile radio communications. Consideration is given to the theory of an effective means for combining the signals from a twin antennae space diversity arrangement using phase sweeping in opposite directions for the two antennae. An analysis is presented for various modulation methods. A mathematical model is also used to obtain results for practically realizable receiver characteristics.

"Measures of spectral efficiency are very important to the resolution of contemporary issues in Land Mobile Radio (LMR), because they (a) allow the comparison of existing and proposed systems in terms of their spectral efficiency; (b) permit estimates to be made of the ultimate capacity of various system types at different levels of development; and (c) are useful in setting minimum standards for spectral efficiency. The purpose of this paper is to review the advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of various measures of spectral efficiency that have been proposed."

"Innovative techniques and attention to frequently-ignored factors have been combined in a new personal radio signaling system. Accessed by means of TOUCH-TONE® service, customer dialing errors are effectively controlled through the use of self-checking numbers, eliminating a common cause of missed or false signals. A multiplicity of radio transmitters are arranged to provide adequate building penetration for the entire service area. Simultaneous transmitter operation and low speed, digital receivers work together to make use of multipath radio propagation. Redundancy of equipment and terminal functions assure that electronic failures result in minimal impairment of service. Combining all of the above design features has resulted in a service that is significantly more reliable than that which is provided by systems of earlier design."

"Selectivity measurement techniques, specifications and test equipment requirements for evaluating selectivity in mobile communications receivers are discussed. The trend to greater Government regulation of receiver performance, the anticipated growth of the mobile radio market, and the pressures to increase the cost efficiency of technical personnel will combine to intensify the need for new techniques and equipment capable of more rapid comprehensive evaluation of communication equipment performance. The advent of programmable test equipment and the rapid advancement in micro-computer technology will introduce a new level of sophistication to mobile radio manufacturing test and maintenance procedures."
"This paper deals with the thick-film hybrid integrated circuit process currently being used to realize complex circuit functions in hybrid form. The thick-film technology, active device attachment, and packaging all play important roles in the overall systems approach. A description of the various processes will be presented starting with the ceramic substrate and ending with the completed package. Extensive use is made of computer-controlled laser trimming for both static trimming of resistors and functional trimming of modules after assembly. When properly used, the laser is a powerful tool. Active devices are attached using a solder-reflow technique. All of the connections on the active devices are terminated using solder bumps connsisting of a tin/lead alloy. There are corresponding land areas on the ceramic substrate that have been coated with a tin/lead solder. The land areas on the substrate are designed in such a way as to restrict the solder wetting to the small area around the terminal similar to the IBM, \"controlled collapse\" process. The techniques employed result in thick-film hybrid integrated circuits that are economical, reliable, high in yield, and offer considerable flexibility to the hybrid manufacturer."
"In this paper, a statistical method is developed for analysis of interference in land mobile communication systems. Reduction of communication range and degradation of system reliability are calculated. This method can be used for cases in which a desired signal is transmitted by a base station (or mobile unit) and received by a mobile unit (or base station) and is interfered with by a signal transmitted either by a fixed station or a mobile unit. The spatial probability distribution of mobile units is considered. The method is applicable to any frequency band for which path loss statistics are known. An example of this method is given which calculates reduction in communication range, area and degradation of communication reliability for different values of splatter protection and distributions of mobile units."
   "Many existing 2-tone, possibly 3-tone Bellboy®, paging systems in our metropolitan areas have reached system capacity. By allocating a small percentage of air time for a higher signaling rate and larger code capacity pager, channel capacity can be increased several times. The low capacity pager can then be phased out slowly allowing graceful systems growth. The resultant system false alarm rates caused by this channel sharing of several signaling types is discussed along with the sequential and simulcast transmission effects. The sequential 5-tone system and several generalized digital techniques are considered in this evluation."
"The 4-phase PSK and the Fast FSK are two different digital modulation systems; both perform well when it is required to conserve power as well as bandwidth. This report discusses some of the subtle differences between their signal structures, their spectral occupancy, and between the circuitry which \"self synchronizes\", i.e. regenerates carrier phase and clock references at their receivers."

"To the computer specialist the thoughts of applying his technology to the determination and preservation of his own and society's health by computer is very attractive. To the physician the computer appears as a complex unknown. Depending on his computer-related, experience, it may be a threat or a tool."

"During the last decade, interest has increased in the use of computers in the delivery of health care services in the United States and Europe. One of the early applications of computers in clinical care was in intensive care units (ICU's) where computers were felt to be useful to nurses in monitoring the condition of these critically ill patients, and in alerting them to sudden changes in patient condition."
"Much of the present consumer concern with American health care starts with the discrepancy most people experience between the office visit to a doctor and the focus of most medical research and its results. Medical progress has affected public health and the acutely ill or disabled, but has had comparatively minor impact on the average doctor-patient encounter outside the hospital, university medical center, or other specialized setting. In 1970, 72% of the population consulted a physician at least once, but only 10.3% reported one or more hospital episodes; American Hospital Association statistics showed community hospitals averaging 4.6 outpatient visit every one inpatient admission.<R>1</R>"

"The medical record is maintained for the express purpose of enabling the physician to deliver better care to the patient. But its usefulness in achieving that purpose has often been hampered by its inflation with voluminous, unorganized notes, and test results. The medical profession has begun to recognize this, and work has recently been done in reviewing the structure of the medical record with hopes of making improvements.<R>1</R> Based on what has been learned so far, it appears that the most effective record is one containing a broad data base including many investigative procedures, while at the same time focusing the physician's attention on problems or diagnoses derived from the data base.<R>2</R> These problems express only the essential information derived from the data base–that information which forms the basis for the treatment regimen."
"With the increased sophistication of laboratory instrumentation, physician and nursing staffs are being presented with large amounts of clinical data which they are expected to interpret in order to formulate proper therapy for their patients. One of the recent advances has been the development of arterial blood gas analysis. This test now provides reliable, accurate data on the blood gas status of patients, thereby presenting information to clinical staffs which was not available before. Accompanying these improvements in technique has been a steady increase in knowledge and studies performed on various blood gas disorders.<R>1-8</R>"
"Computer technology has had a major impact on virtually all segments of society and industry. The medical profession, however, is an exception. No major changes in the behavior of the practicing doctor have resulted from the past 15 years of computer research in medicine. Although there are isolated examples where computer technology has been used in the laboratory and in accounting, computer technology has not become an integral, cost-effective part of today's medicine."
"The impact of solid-state technology, as it emerges in the form of large-scale integration of computer functions, is dramatic. The effects are felt at all levels–by users, systems designers, and the technology houses; the ground rules of design and the economic tradeoffs have been changed, and the structure of the business is being affected. This impact and the emerging technology itself were the subject of a workshop conducted by the Computer Society's Computer Elements Committee last June in Vail, Colorado."

"This book deals primarily with the simulation of hardware systems such as those found in the aeronautical and aerospace industries where differential equations represent the system dynamics. Usually there are known representations of such systems, and because of the nonlinearities, or the need for system identification, simulation must be used to see how components interact and to design them to achieve a desired performance. For such systems, this book provides a distillation of the many years of valuable experience of the authors with engineering systems and provides a view of simulation not found in other books–the use of simulation for control purposes in addition to design. This should be the most important goal of simulations, but it is rarely sought after or achieved. So the orientation here is useful and practical, and in a certain sense, novel."

"During the past year, as more and more microprocessors (as well as information about microprocessors) have become available, the competition for the market has become fierce. The potential user now has a choice of many CPU's varying widely in computing power and price. The price of the low-cost CPU's even in small volume is now below $10 and for the powerful microprocessors ranges from $50 to $100. As the price of the microprocessor decreases toward the $2 to $12 range, the cost of the microcomputer system resides predominantly in the memory and I/O circuitry. This means that additional processors can be added and computing power can be given to applications which might have been uneconomical in the past. This issue of Computer deals with some of the problems that must be dealt with in applying these incredibly low-cost computing elements."

"With the tremendous number of microprocessors on the market today it is becoming increasingly hard to find cross assemblers that run on the particular in-house computer system or timesharing service available. Since most minicomputer systems and almost all timesharing systems have BASIC interpreters or compilers available, this seems to be the most reasonable language choice for writing cross assemblers. It also has a very good trace and debug facility, which is especially useful if you are writing medium-long programs, such as cross-assemblers."
"A key obstacle to wider application of the new microprocessors is the need to program in assembly language with fairly cumbersome instruction sets. We propose a new technique which will make it easy for applications-oriented non-programmers to generate efficient microcomputer programs without any need to learn assembly language. The user merely specifies an analog-computer-like block diagram whose intuitively meaningful block-operators specify standard mathematical operations (addition, multiplication, integration, etc.) and input/output operations (e.g., analog/digital conversion, switching, sensing). These standard operations are implemented as subroutines in the microcomputer read-only memory (ROM). An interactive editor/translator program running on a small minicomputer translates block-diagram specifications into a simple address table and loads it into the microcomputer memory (RAM, PROM, or ROM). This address table represents the block-diagram operation sequence and specifies successive jumps to the correct standard subroutines in ROM and data fetching/storing operations in the random-access memory."
"In th development of any microprocessor-based system, the optimum design will be an efficient compromise between hardware and software. In most microprocessor applications, and particularly in CRT systems, there are usually several real-time functions to be performed with timne constraints that cannot be met with a purely software solution. When microprocessors were first introduced, many potential users investigated them for possible application in new products and concluded that the microprocessor was just not fast enough to do the job. Closer examination will show, however, that most investigators only considered purely software solutions to problems, thereby missing the correct assessment of microprocessor capabilities."
"The objective of this paper is to bring forth the benefits that can be realized by using LSI microprocessors in test equipment and instrument applications. We will attempt to do this by describing the Qualifier* 901, which is a low-cost bench top digital integrated circuit tester controlled by an LSI microprocessor. First, we identify the scope of low-cost testers and describe the general principles of operation of such testers using fixed logic control. Then we describe the Qualifier 901, and finally, we point out the advantages gained by the usage of the intelligence of the microprocessor in Qualifier 901 versus fixed logic controlled testers."

"The term electronic disks has become associated with memory systems that are electronic devices–i.e., not involving mechanical movement, but possessing memory capacities and cost per bit which compete with rotating memories. Many technologies are being investigated that have the potential of being used for electronic disks. These include charge-coupled devices (CCD), magnetic bubbles, domain tip (DOT), and electron beam addressed memories (EBAM)."

"In forecasting future types and uses of electronic disks one must consider processing unit architecture and software systems, as well as trends in computer memory technologies. This paper will concentrate on projections of memory technology, including computer architecture and software trends where relevant to these projections. Technologies which have the potential to result in standard commercial products are addressed rather than those which will result only in laboratory prototypes or militarized equipments designed for unique application environments. For example, a technology which may be uniquely suited for space applications may be much too expensive to compete as a commercial product. Bit densities, costs, access times, and other characteristics have been projected as representative of products which are in production, are available in quantity from several vendors, and are therefore competitively priced."

This will be achieved in small volume and without the use of moving parts. The potential applications of such a mass memory system are widespread, ranging from direct drum and disk replacement to new systems with architectures that would take advantage of improved random access times and increased data rates."

These effects will range from simple changes such as direct substitution for disks, where significant productivity increases can be easily achieved, through more radical changes where both hardware and software are changed in structure to exploit the potential of these new devices. Such changes include architectures for transaction-based computing, real-time computing with nonresident programs, and more flexible structures for time-shared computers."

At the onset, a set of objectives is identified in the areas of mission, weight, performance, payload, etc., which are specified with a fairly good knowledge of the available design technology and constraints. The designer possesses a fund of accumulated experience and knowledge that he applies, with imagination and intuition, to meet the requirements and constraints he has been given. The knowledge and experience of the designer are more and more frequently being delegated to the computer; intuition and imagination can never be. In spite of the extensive use of computers in portions of the design process, total turnaround times are long; drudgery interrupts and stalls the engineer. The total project data is segmented and scattered throughout the design team to such an extend that accessing, coordinating, and updating become difficult and complex. The team gets the job done, but only after painfully tedious effort."

"Significant technological advances in the design and production of electronic assemblies have sizably increased their reliability and durability while greatly reducing their physical size. New manufacturing technologies have been developed which markedly increase the speed and accuracy of production. Such advances in production greatly complicate the inspection of these devices by humans. Essentially, the techniques used 10 years ago are still used for inspection in production lines. Much of the inspection is done by humans whose performance–not surprisingly–is generally inadequate and variable. The human visual system is adapted to perform in a world of variety and change; the inspection process, on the other hand, requires observing the same type of image repeatedly to detect anomalies. This requirement can often be met successfully by automation."

"The state of software engineering is diverse, disorderly, and expanding, Coined less than seven years ago, the term is used today to describe such disparate activities as programming methodology, software development, and programming tools and standards. But for all the confusion surrounding it, this new discipline does seem to promise solutions to some of the most vexing problems of modern software development efforts: reliability and complexity. Clearly, the subject deserves to be explored."

"The dramatic decline in computer hardware costs in recent years has brought the costs of software development into sharp focus. But important efforts to address software technology have been underway during the same period–notably in the 60's by Böhm, Jacopini, Dijkstra, Parnas, and others in the university environment, and in the 70's by such people as Mills and Baker, who defined specific elements of a methodology directed toward reducing software costs and improving software quality. This methodology, which according to Mills and Baker was successfully applied to the New York Times information bank project, is generally referred to as structured programming (SP)–but includes such methods as top down design and chief programmer teams."
"Session I addressed the concepts and definitions of structured programming (SP)."
"The software development process is being reexamined critically these days. There are at least two reasons for this renewed scrutiny: First, the inexorable advance of hardware technology has now made software costs the clearly dominant component of computing costs. Second, amidst the furor over SP, we have collectively realized that we can indeed do better (in at least the coding subprocess of software production). This realization leads us to reconsider current design and implementation strategies for possibly better ways."
"There is no doubt about it, structured programming (SP) is making waves. Wherever one goes within the computing community people are asking what it is and how they can use it. And the answers they are receiving are sometimes very different. This inability to pin down a precise definition has caused the original concept of SP to become widely distorted. For example, a recent advertisement described SP as \"a means of improving the quality of the code, improving project control, reducing the debugging phase of the project, forcing good software documentation as an integral part of the system design, and making programs less sensitive to turnover of project personnel.\"<R>1</R> Thus portrayed as a panacea for the entire programming process, it is not surprising that in a recent week-long seminar given by Dr. Dijkstra, he refused to use the term at all."
"It has now been about four years since the first impressive experience using structured programming* techniques on a large production software project.<R>1</R> Yet one still hears wildly varying claims about its effectiveness in general. Here are some recent samples."
"The history of structured programming at McDonnell Douglas Automation could be divided into two ages or eras: BC and AD. BC represents Before Clarity and AD represents After Discernment."
"Much has been written describing structured programming (SP) technologies, but little has been written concerning measurable results from using those technologies to deliver programs within cost, time, and performance constraints. SP technologies have been applied to large-scale real-time program development, analyzed, and further developed at Hughes since 1971. As new software projects are started, the respective managers must state which of the technologies will and will not be used. The use of the applied techniques is then monitored to determine benefits and problems and to define useful modifications to the technologies."
"In early 1973 the Computer Programming Laboratory of Hughes Aircraft Company decided to utilize structured programmning on a medium-sized (12 programmers) real-time system. The system, which was coded in CMS-2Y (MOD 8), ran on the UNIVAC AN/UYK-7 and had extensive hardware and interactive operator interfaces. In addition to the use of structured coding techniques, the software was developed using the \"team concept\" described below."
"The introduction of structured programming into FSD operations and the apparent resulting improvements in the programming process stimulated efforts to measure actual improvement."
"The two projects described here were developed at aine, Farber & Gordon, Inc. using structured programming, although neither project represents a first attempt on our part at using these techniques. (We began using SP techniques in 1970.)"
"At this point, there is no good reason for an organization not to take steps toward adopting some variant of SP techniques. The particular variant will depend a lot on your organization: factors such as the type of applications, personnel, languages used, inventory of existing code, organizational constraints, and typical project size can lead to different preferred approaches. A careful planning and training phase should precede use of the techniques, in order to minimize the risks of their misuse. With this preparation, the benefits of using a suitably tailored SP variant will significantly outweigh the risks."
"The third session dealt with the problems, approaches, and techniques associated with the advancement, development, and implementation of structured programming. The two papers that follow are typical of ideas presented during this session. \"Structured Programming: Agony and/or Ecstasy,\" by John Brown, provides some practical guidelines for introducing any software discipline into an organization. He makes a strong case for a business-like approach–i.e., enlightened management committed to well-defined objectives."
"It has been observed, and perhaps with good reason, that structured programming is a big pain in the neck. And yet, those who profess to have tried it also claim they like it. Furthermore, they insist they will never do without it again. Is it possible that the nay-sayers and the professed believers are talking about the same thing? Probably not. There is at least a subtle distinction which lies somewhere near the heart of the continuing structured programming controversy."
"During the past three years, SofTech has been developing design and specification methods with the goals of improving design quality, reducing integration problems, increasing software portability, and enhancing project control and estimating methods. In particular we wanted to increase the visibility of the detailed design process in order to facilitate design reviews and design iterations. We also hoped to improve the description and management of all module interfaces in order to reduce integration problems and to allow alternative implementations of a module to be \"plug-to-plug\" compatible–an important consideration when software systems requiring several man-years to build are designed to be portable."
"The last session of the 1974 Lake Arrowhead Workshop was oriented towards the future of structured programming. Inasmuch as discussions in the preceding sessions had focused on current achievements (and sometimes failures), we tried in the concluding session to offer some answers to the question: Where do we go from here?"
"I adopt the point of view that an ideal language contains features well-matched to the abstract concepts which the problem-solving programmer uses in his own thinking. I also assume that the modifiability of programs is of paramount importance. The features below are not necessarily listed in order of importance; an ideal general-purpose programming language should probably have all of them because each one encourages a more systematic structured writing of programs. Most of these features are contained in some form in at least one implemented language, but unfortunately the best known and most used languages contain few of them."
"In this workshop, the restructuring problem has been alluded to several times. Manual restructuring–i.e., the complete rewrite of a project using top-down design and implementation methods–has been offered as a way of improving existing software."
"The major idea of SP is to divide a programming task into easily understandable units. Within these units, it may be of little consequence whether the language used is COBOL, FORTRAN, PL/1, or any of the new SP languages. Language design (such as control structures) may determine the size of the program which is the largest easily understandable unit. This is at best a local optimization. I have seen well-structured programs written in assembly language, FORTRAN, and APL–none of which are known for their facilities to enhance structured programming. However, any language claiming to enhance SP should provide a facility for connection among program units: this could be as complex as the abstract type mechanisms of Liskov's CLU or Wulf's ALPHARD, or it could be a simple procedure/macro facility. Poor design of these features limits the effectiveness of languages like FORTRAN and COBOL in the construction of well-structured programs. These facilities are often faked by a preprocessor or by system convention."
"Structured code has been restricted to the use of certain control statements, such as IF, CASE, and WHILE. The absence of a GOTO implies that control enters and leaves regions of code in a LIFO manner. Hence, the control environment can be maintained by a stack of return addresses; and call and return instructions, rather than branches, can be used to transfer control in the machine. The SDL S-machine follows this principle."
"One of the loveliest uses of SP I have come across is in vehicle testing. The Army particularly makes use of computers and automatic test equipment to mechanically test out new vehicles and uncover malfunctions. The programs for automatic test equipment are such that significant economic gain can be achieved in their development, documentation, and maintenance, provided appropriate language and system features are available."
"My prime interest in participating in this session is to project the applicability of SP to the development of software for Distributed Computer Systems (such as the UC Irvine Distributed Computer System and the CMU C.MMP). The difficulties common to all software design and development efforts are made even more acute when writing software for a DCS. Setting up experiments that involve widely separated, loosely coupled computers is not an easy or straightforward task. Error situations may develop fortuitously and then evade most efforts to cause them to occur again. In this predicament, structured modular top-down programming techniques appear likely to play an important role since they offer an opportunity to bring significant software reliability improvements."
"We have heard a lot said in the past few days about some very advanced techniques and ideas relating to better ways of developing software. While I would not take anything away from what has been said, I would like to point out that there are some very serious practical problems in getting the great majority of practitioners in the industry to use and benefit from SP. If the people that I deal with are representative of the industry in general, there are a lot of engineers and programmers who do not yet have an appreciation of SP. If we do not consolidate the gains that are possible in the use of advanced languages and language facilities, we may lose the potential benefits of SP."
"Developments now pending will alter the character of SP, as we presently know it, beyond recognition. SP is essentially a discipline for a programming shop that turns out programs in response to assignments. It enables better planning and control of software development work and improves productivity of the programmers. New technology will alter the roles of the chief programmer and the members of his team."
"The main trends discernible both in Session IV and in the general discussion that ended the 1974 Lake Arrowhead Workshop can be summarized as follows:"
"Redundancy, the state of being in excess of what is necessary, as applied in the implementation of computer arithmetic is motivated by three design goals: to improve reliability, to increase speed of operation, and/or to provide structural flexibility. In achieving the first goal, improvement of reliability, hardware redundancy and/or redundant arithmetic codes are applied to the detection and correction of faults. Although this is an increasingly vital area it will not be discussed in this paper. Rather, the focus will be on the other two potential benefits: more specifically, on the judicious use of number systems employing redundancy in representation. A positional number system with fixed radix, r, is redundant if the allowable digit set includes more than r distinct elements, thereby affording alternate representations of a given numeric value. Uniqueness. of representation is sacrificed with hope of greater gains. A novel, rigorous treatment of redundant, radix polynomial representation is included in Reference 1."

X φpis sufficient for the network, as a whole, to produce all the output functions the network could realize, the above range is not necessary in general. Finally we derive a sufficient condition for the proposition that the range of logical flexibility of the network, φ1X ...φp, is critical. This gives a relationship between the range of logical flexibility obtained by considering a cell in the network and the one obtained by considering the whole network."
"This paper discusses a technique whereby a logic design which is unconstrained may be replaced quasi-optimally with modules from a constrained library. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the replacement of modules within a network are developed and then reformulated as integer linear programs. These integer linear programs are solved during individual steps of a dynamic programming formulation of the network replacement problem. Execution time of the algorithm increases linearly with the network size and the algorithm produces optimal replacements of fan-out-free networks."
"Five operations are defined in the Rademacher-Walsh transform domain. It is shown that these operations allow Boolean functions to be classified in a very concise way. The result of applying this classification to Boolean functions of up to fourth order indicates that threshold functions play an important part in the composition of Boolean functions. A synthesis method is developed for the synthesis of any Boolean function using, as a basic element, an \"optimized universal threshold logic gate.\" This gate overcomes the analog threshold tolerancing problems encountered in other threshold gate designs and is readily fabricated in an integrated circuit form. The use of this gate in logic design is expected to provide a considerable cost-saving over conventional methods."
"The Boolean difference is a well-known mathematical concept which has found significant application in the single fault analysis of combinational logic circuits. One of the primary attributes of the Boolean difference in such situations is its completeness. In this paper we extend the Boolean difference concept to cover multiple fault situations. Expressions are developed which give all possible input patterns that can be applied to combinational logic circuits to demonstrate the presence or absence of a specified multiple fault of the stuck-type class. Such expressions are useful in situations where at most, say, p simultaneous faults need be considered, as well as situations where any multiple fault can exist. In addition the expressions developed are also shown to complete some existing single fault analysis concepts."
"Due to the considerable progresses during the past few years, metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) has become one of the most important technologies for large-scale integration (LSI). Since a fairly complex function can be realized by a single MOS cell, most of the conventional algorithms which use NOR, NAND, AND, and OR gates as the basic building blocks are not suitable to synthesize MOS networks. This paper presents two simple efficient algorithms to synthesize 2-level MOS networks with a minimum number of cells."
"The organization and functional design of a parallel radix-4 fast Fourier transform (FFT) computer for real-time signal processing of wide-band signals is introduced."
"The methods developed in this correspondence represent an approach to the problem of handling error-corrupted syntactic pattern strings, an area generally neglected in the numerous techniques for linguistic pattern description and recognition which have been reported. The basic approach consists of applying error transformations to the productions of context-free grammars in order to generate new grammars (also context-free) capable of describing not only the original error-free patterns, but also patterns containing specific types of errors such as deleted, added, and interchanged symbols which arise often in the pattern-scanning process. Theoretical developments are illustrated in the framework of a syntactic recognition system for chromosome structures."
"In Hough [1], Duda and Hart [2], and Griffith [3] procedures were proposed for detecting lines in pictures and in [2] Duda and Hart extended their method for more general algebraic curve, fitting. This correspondence shows how this method can be used to detect any given curve in a specific orientation. The procedure presented here con be easily implemented and can be efficiently implemented in a parallel machine."
"The problem of piecewise polynomial L2 approximation with variable boundaries is considered. Necdssary and sufficient conditions for local optima are derived. These suggest simple functional iteration, algorithms for locating the boundaries."
"Given a combinational output function f and an input constraint φ = 0, there is a set G( f, φ) of output functions equivalent to f with respect to φ. A function belongs to G( f, φ), that is, provided its evaluations agree with those of f for all argument combinations satisfying the constraint φ = 0. We define the constrained-input problem as that of generating G( f, φ), given f and φ. A general solution for this problem is developed. Applications to the \"don't-care\" problem and to translator synthesis are discussed."
"This correspondence provides some clarifications and revision to the above-mentioned paper.1 It also presents the generalized versions of the definitions and theorems related to closure classes. These versions are applicable to arbitrary subsets of the state set of a sequential machine."
"In the above paper1, the partial Boolean difference is defined and an algorithm for deriving complete minimal test input sequences for single-fault detection is given. In this correspondence, it is shown that the presentation of the algorithm is inadequate with respect to the need for multiple path sensitization. It is further shown that the computational procedure used in footnote 1 does not guarantee minimality of the test set and does not permit the extension to fault location as claimed in the paper."
"I wish to thank Metze et al. for having identified certain sources of difficulty with the algorithm given in my paper.1 The notion of \"partial Boolean difference\" introduced in my paper—and on which the algorithm was based—was unfortunately restricted to single path sensitization thus resulting in the well-known limitations of such an approach. The concept of partial Boolean difference, however, is quite general and directly applicable to multiple path sensitization. Such Boolean differences are known as multiple partial Boolean differences, and their utility has been previously recognized in test-code generation [1], [2]."
"Written by two authors with mathematical background, this book introduces very basic concepts of logic, some simple logic elements and outlines the fundamentals of synthesis of switching networks. The book contains sixteen brief chapters."
"This boook deals primarily with the simulation of hardware systems such as those found in the aeronautical and aerospace industries where differential equations represent the system dynamics. Usually there are known representations of such systems, and because of the nonlinearities, or the need for system identification, simulation must he used to see how components interact and to design them to achieve a desired performance. For such systems, this book provides a distillation of the many years of valuable experience of the authors with engineering systems and provides a view of simulation not found in other books—the use of simulation for control purposes in addition to design. This should be the most, important goal of simulations, but it is rarely sought after or achieved. So the orientation here is useful and practical, and in a certain sense, novel."

"The design of a simple hardware memory allocator is described, which allocates blocks of different lengths L = 2h = K, K-1,..., K-n in a memory according to the buddy system algorithm. The binary tree, representing the distribution of free and used blocks in memory is mapped into a set of shift registers. They are connected for end-around shifting and clocked with frequencies different for each register, preserving thereby the internal structure of the binary tree. A small counter, attached to each shift register in the set holds the address of the first free block and can be read out on request within 0.5 μs. A simple control unit realizes the algorithm. Having answered a request the system needs about 130 μs to compute the addresses of free blocks in a total of 511 blocks managed by the device."
"Control and trajectory optimization involves the minimization of a performance index (PI) of integral form where some optimal control law exists in a dynamic system. In this paper, a hybrid minicomputer with an adaptive random-search algorithm implements an iterative search for the optimal control. The search assumes that some initial control is randomly perturbed and a fast analog computer generates respective PI from the analog response of the dynamic system. An improved PI informs the digital computer to utilize the perturbed control as a basis for the next iteration; otherwise a new perturbation replaces the old perturbation in the next iteration. The search terminates when no further improvements occur."
"A general mathematical model is developed as an idealization of the problem of determining cloud motions from satellite pictures. The model consists of superimposed planes of rigid moving polygons. The problem is to determine from a sequence of scenes the linear and angular velocities of the figures, and to decompose the scene into its component figures. Study of the model reveals a number of fundamental relations that form the basis for an analysis program. In particular, a systematic anaylsis is given of the topological changes that can occur when overlapping figures move together or apart. A computer program based on these results is described, and experimental results are presented."
"This correspondence provides an extended version of the algebraic method using Boolean algebra for deriving all maximal compatibles. It then shows that the algorithm based on the reduction of the edge-inclusion table, with respect to a given incompatibility graph for finding all maximal compatibles, is equivalent to the extended version just mentioned, and that the latter is much simpler."
"In this correspondence, an approach to unsupervised pattern classifiers is discussed. The classifiers discussed here have the ability of obtaining the consistent estimates of unknown statistics of input patterns without knowing the a priori probability of each category's occurrence where the input patterns are of a mixture distribution. An analysis is made about their asymptotic behavior in order to show that the classifiers converge to the Bayes' minmum error classifier. Also, some results of a computer simulation on learning processes are shown."

"This correspondence deals with the problem of finding periodic equivalents of finite automata, The idea of periodic equivalent is a generalization of the concept of strictly periodic equivalent studied in [4]. In this correspondence some essential properties of periodic equivalents of finite automata are investigated. Further-more, the concept of strong kernel of automaton is introduced and some connections of strong kernels with periodic equivalents are presented. Finally, the algorithm for determining minimal periodic equivalents of automata is given."
"Fault detecting test sets to detect multiple stuck-at-faults (s-a-faults) in certain networks, realizing Reed-Muller(RM) canonic expressions called RM canonic (RMC) networks, are given. It is shown that to detect t faults, t ≥ 1, in a network realizing an arbitrary n-variable logic function only tests need be applied ([x] is the integer part of x) and that these tests are independent of the function being realized."

"The complexity of the universal programs is compared with the complexity of the programs being simulated. The results suggest that the efficiency of the universal machines depends heavily on the programs being simulated. All the results are machine-independent and they are derived based on the recursion theorem."
"Logic gates subject to asymmetric input faults may be made more reliable by employing redundant inputs. A mathematical expression for determining the optimum number of redundant inputs based on input reliabilities of the gate is developed. The development follows the theory of combinatorial probability."
"A simplified proof of a modification of Booth's multiplication algorithm by MacSorley to a form which examines three multiplier bits at a time is presented. In comparison with the original Booth's algorithm, which examines two bits at a time, the modified algorithm requires half the nutmber of iterations at the cost of somewhat increased complexity for each iteration."
"Mayeda and Ramamoorthy have reduced the problem of finding a minimum number of test points which detect an improperly operating functional element of a single entry-single exit (SEC) system graph, to the problem of finding a minimum number of edges under which this system graph is 1 distinguishable. This correspondence shows that the determilnation of the minimum edge set is equivalent to the determination of a minimum covering of a certain matrix M (S) of zeros and ones. A way of finding the matrix M (S) is proposed."
"This correspondence points out that the usual terminal correction for nonrestoring division can always be made in such a way as to permit concatenation of the primary and secondary quotients to form a double precision answer. This eliminates the necessity of any separate postcorrection as suggested in [1] and [2]."
"A machine word mathematical formulation is applied to analysis and synthesis of circuits for signed binary number multiplication. The circuits are related to each other and to contemporary circuit algorithms in the course of the syntheses and in a comparative discussion. Circuits with complemented multiplier/multiplicand (M̄) or complemented partial product word (P̄) corrections offer advantages in circuit symmetry and algorithmic structure."
"A standard serial interfacing scheme is described. It is appropriate for the interfacing of a variety of peripherals to minicomputers, as well as for the interconnection of two or more minicomputers. The use of this serial interface simplifies the problem of compatibility of communications between computers and peripherals with different word lengths. It is quite easy for computers with different word lengths to communicate with each other without modifications of any hardware."
"It is shown that the cyclic correlation between two Walsh functions is identically zero except if they have equal \"Contradegrees.\""
 "Algorithms for reconstruction of a two-dimensional binary pattern Z from its row-projection vector A and column-projection vector B have been developed by Chang. The projection set (A,B) is said to be unique, nonunique, or inconsistent if it determines one binary pattern, more than one binary pattern, or no binary pattern. A binary patern Z is said to be ambiguous if there exists another pattern with the same projections, otherwise it is unambiguous. Two characterization questions of binary patterns and their projections are posed. First, given Z what is the necessary and sufficient condition for Z to be ambiguous, or unambiguous? Second, given (A,B), what is the necessary and sufficient condition for (A,B) to be unique, nonunique, or inconsistent? These two combinational questions are discussed and efficient algorithms to answer them are derived from some ideas of Ryser."
"The technique for improving the linearity between the input voltage and the frequency of oscillation is described. This improvement is accomplished by adding a control circuit to Concentional voltage-to-frequency converters. From the experimental results, the linearity of this converter was about 0.15 percent at the frequency of 1 MHz."

"An algorithm is presented for transposing large nonsquare matrices stored externally or in core. A fast algorithm of Eklundh and direct algorithm are applied to partitioned matrices and combined to effect the transpose of a nonsquare matrix. The matrix must be augmented so that its dimensions have a large common divisor. In the case of large externally stored matrices, additional external storage for a matrix of equal size is not required."

"de Lugish [1] has defined efficient algorithms in radix 2 for certain elementary functions such as Y[X,Y/X1/2, Y + lnX, Y.exp (X), etc. His technique requires a systematic 1-bit left shift of a partially converged result, together with two 4-bit comparisons to select a ternary digit for the next iteration. This selection of digits reduces the average number of full precision additions to about 1/3 of those required in conventional schemes [3]. This paper develops modified algorithms in radix 2 which are more efficient when the time for a full precision addition is comparable to the time for a shift and comparison. The modified procedure is developed for Y/X in detail where more than a 40 percent decrease in execution time is achieved for only a marginal increase in cost."
"Equational logic is an approach to combinational synthesis based on the equation f(x) = 1 rather than on the function f(x). The central problem of equational logic is to find a system of equations gi(x) = hi(x) (i = 1,2,...,k), of the simplest possible form, that has the same solutions as f(x) = 1. Given such a k-equation system, f(x) may be realized as the output of a k-wide digital comparator whose inputs are the 2k g's and h's constituting the system."
"Analytic models are developed to evaluate the performance of a multiprocessor computer system. Markov chain techniques are used to model memory conflicts when the memory is modularized. The instruction execution rate (IER) is chosen as the measure of performance. The performance is studied with different storage allocations for instructions and data and with interleaving in the instruction space."
"A digital signal processing technique is described which utilizes a built-in automatic gain control (AGC) function. A particularly attractive algorithm called \"geometric feedback\" is developed which has certain desirable properties. A simple analytic solution of the response is derived for the special case of linear geometric feedback."
"Determination of the detectability and diagnosability of a digital system containing at most t faulty system components is considered. The model employed is to an extent independent of the means used to implement diagnostic procedures, i.e., whether the tests are accomplished via hardware, software, or combinations thereof. A parameter, called the closure index, is defined which characterizes the capability for executing valid tests in the presence of faults. The closure index can be thought of as the size of the smallest potentially undetectable multiple-fault in the system as modeled. On the basis of this parameter, results are presented which permit the determination of t-fault detectability and t-fault diagnosability with repair for the system. Examples are presented to illustrate the application of the model for systems close to those encountered in actual practice."
"A simple yet efficient method for the minimization of incompletely specified sequential machines (ISSM's) is proposed. Precise theorems are developed, as a consequence of which several compatibles can be deleted from consideration at the very first stage in the search for a minimal closed cover. Thus, the computational work is significantly reduced. Initial cardinality of the minimal closed cover is further reduced by a consideration of the maximal compatibles (MC's) only; as a result the method converges to the solution faster than the existing procedures. \"Rank\" of a compatible is defined. It is shown that ordering the compatibles, in accordance with their rank, reduces the number of comparisons to be made in the search for exclusion of compatibles. The new method is simple, systematic, and programmable. It does not involve any heuristics or intuitive procedures. For small- and medium-sized machines, it can be used for hand computation as well. For one of the illustrative examples used in this paper, 30 out of 40 compatibles can be ignored in accordance with the proposed rules and the remaining 10 compatibles only need be considered for obtaining a minimal solution."
"Algebraic reduction procedures for multivalued logic functions based upon a principally binary circuit realization are presented. The procedures given are also applicable to literal gate realizations employing compound literals. The prime implicant generation and covering problems are treated in detail. It is shown that the selected cover must be iteratively examined for possible reduction at each decision point of the covering process. This reduction is achieved by the elimination of unnecessary nonadjacencies."
"Methods are presented for designing fault-detection experiments for sequential machines which are realized as parallel connections of simpler component machines. The outputs of these components are assumed to be inaccessible for measurement but it is shown that knowledge of the structure can be utilized to design simpler experiments. The procedure is based upon placing all components but one in a fixed reference state prior to measuring input/output sequences for this one component in order to deduce its state table. This means that the only measurable transitions are those which return the other components to their reference states. Such transitions are made in response to application of restricted input sequences and it is necessary that the state table be deduced from such a set of observations."
"This correspondence comments on the method of circle generation described by Armstrong [1], and discusses the methods by which satisfactory circles for computer graphics may be obtained with digital differential analyzers (DDA's) using a single-phase Adam's procedure."
"The realization of arbitrary switching functions using the universal logic modules of Yau and Tang [1], [2] has the disadvantage that, in general, large trees of modules result. A decomposition theorem and an algorithm are given for reducing the size of such trees, using what is called a chain decomposition."
"A technique is described which allows overlapping images to be combined into a photomosaic in which the visual impact of the introduced seam. has been minimized. Images which have been brought into geometric and gray scale register are combined on a line-by-line basis by choosing a \"best\" seam point for each line. The resulting artificial edge at the seam point is then locally smoothed."
"This correspondence describes an improved computational algorithm for the Hadamard transform and the R transform. By performing the computation \"in place\", the number of storage locations is minimized and the speed is increased. The transformed coefficients are in the order of increasing sequency."
"The concept of \"neighborhood of a point\" has been used in various programs for analyzing spatial dot patterns. The common definition based on k-nearest neighbors does not reflect the intuitive cluster associations of certain points in simple patterns. An alternative definition is proposed to reflect such associations more satisfactorily. Its applications includes cluster analysis and descriptive measures for dot patterns."
"This correspondence describes simple queueing models for a magnetic bubble memory chip organization. Some of the unique features of bubble memories are outlined. The performance improvement due to bidirectional shifting is modeled as a function of program locality."
"An algorithm for finding the prime implicants of a Boolean function is given. The algorithm is similar to Nelson's algorithm since both involve the operations of complementing, expanding, and simplifying, but the new algorithm includes the additional operation of factoring. The algorithm with factoring is proved, and it is shown that factoring accounts for a dramatic increase in efficiency over Nelson's algorithm. The increased efficiency is illustrated with timing results obtained from several examples that were implemented for both algorithms using the symbolic manipulation systems SETS."
"An algorithm is given for the base-extension (BE) computation in residue number systems that requires the standard four steps (for systems with three moduli) but which saves hardware. Furthermore, for the particular moduli m-1, m, and m+1 it is shown that fast-BE in only two steps is possible, for all combinations of the moduli."
"The transition preserving morphisms (endomorphism, homomorphism, isomorphism, and automorphism) of state machines are developed on the basis of nontrivial closed partitions over their state sets. Algorithms with illustrated examples are provided for determining these morphisms. By means of these morphisms, the structural preserving morphisms of finite automata can be readily solved by simply making a constraint on each partition being not only nontrivial and closed but also output-consistent."
"We consider the problem of finding the minimum number K(n,c) of total switching functions of n variables necessary to cover the set of all switching functions which are specified in at most c positions. We find an exact solution for K(n,2) and an upper bound for K(n,c) which is better than a previously known upper bound by an exponential factor."
"This correspondence comments on the statement, described in the above-mentioned paper,1 which follows after a few definitions characterizing input-output sequences for the design of checking experiments. Namely, a counterexample will be shown for one of the two statements. Furthermore, three generalized properties useful to demonstrate the above counterexample are presented."
"Mealy synchronous machines cannot be implemented by Chuang and Das\"1 procedure for multiple-input change asynchronous circuits. The circuit must be changed to handle this common type of machine."
"Prof. Bredeson rightly points out that the realization shown in the Figs. 1 and 4 of the above paper1 imposes a restriction that Mealy machines cannot be realized. But, as we pointed out in Section V of our paper, the output flip-flops are used in our realization only to remove possible hazards in the output terminals. For some applications, the output hazards could be tolerable and in such situations the output flip-flops are not necessary. Evidently, the Mealy machines can be realized in such cases. It is pertinent here to point out that most of the previous works on asynchronous machines avoided the issue of output hazards."

"This paper discusses the design of a primary memory system for an array processor which allows parallel, conflict-free access to various slices of data (e.g., rows, columns, diagonals, etc.), and subsequent alignment of these data for processing. Memory access requirements for an array processor are discussed in general terms and a set of common requirements are defined. The ability to meet these requirements is shown to depend on the number of independent memory units and on the mapping of the data in these memories. Next, the need to align these data for processing is demonstrated and various alignment requirements are defined. Hardware which can perform this alignment function is discussed, e.g., permutation, indexing, switching or sorting networks, and a network (the omega network) based on Stone's shuffle-exchange operation [1] is presented. Construction of this network is described and many of its useful properties are proven. Finally, as an example of these ideas, an array processor is shown which allows conflict-free access and alignment of rows, columns, diagonals, backward diagonals, and square blocks in row or column major order, as well as certain other special operations."
"Diagnosability without fault repair of a digital system containing at most t faults is considered. A system-level diagnostic model defined in an earlier paper [1] is employed. The model is to an extent independent of the means used to implement diagnostic procedures, i.e., whether the tests are accomplished via hardware, software, or combinations thereof. Two parameters, the masking and exposure indices, are defined. Conjoined with the previously defined closure index, the parameters fundamentally characterize the capability for executing valid tests in a multiple-fault environment. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a system to be t-fault diagnosable without repair are derived in terms of these parameters. Examples are presented to illustrate the application of the model for systems close to those encountered in actual practice."
"In this paper, which is a follow up to [8], we are concerned with the problem of generating minimal experiments to locate and diagnose faults in combinational tree networks. We establish lower bounds on the necessary number of fault-locating tests and show how, in a systematic way, such experiments can be obtained. Two types of testing procedures are considered—adaptive and preset."
"This paper treats two dynamic memories, one proposed by Aho and Ullman and the other proposed by Stone. The first memory has the property that every item is accessible in 0 (log2 N) steps, and that after access to the first two items of a block of contiguous items, each successive item can be accessed in unit time. In this paper we give a new derivation of the properties, and indicate minor variations and improvements of the memory-access algorithm."
"The main thrust of this paper is to present a new algorithm for the analysis of structure in multivariate data point clusters from the standpoint of intrinsic (topological) dimensionality."
"A technique is presented that uses both cluster analysis and a Monte Carlo significance test of clusters to discover associations between variables in multidimensional data. The method is applied to an example of a noisy function in three-dimensional space, to a sample from a mixture of three bivariate normal distributions, and to the well-known Fisher's Iris data."

"A formal method of correcting errors of changed, deleted, and inserted terminals in the strings of a context-free language is considered. Grammars generating strings containing these errors are first constructed from a known grammar for the language; these new grammars are then used to specify simple syntax-directed translation schemata which can parse both correct strings and strings with errors and simultaneously produce output strings in the original language. Stochastic aspects of productions and of errors are incorporated into the correction model to assign probabilities to translations produced."
"Any switching function has weighted representations, i.e., symmetric representations for which some of the arguments are repeated. We call a logic network based on such a representation a weighted realization. It is shown that a weighted realization may be implemented using a full-adder network (called a moment generator) whose outputs are fed to a multiplexer. A procedure is given to synthesize the full-adder network using the fewest possible modules and with strong coalescing of modules into multibit adders."
"The purpose of this paper is to present an algorithm for transposing large rectangular matrices. This is basically a generalization of Eklundh's algorithm. Eklundh's method is designed to handle arrays in place of using powers-of-2 approach wherein partitions of the matrix have dimensions which are powers of 2. The algorithm presented here does not have this restriction. The choice of partitions is posed as an optimal control problem amenable to solution using Bellman's principle of optimality. The optimal partitioning of the matrix can be determined depending on the computer configuration (i.e., core size, whether moving-head or fixed-head disk drives are used, number of words per track, etc.) and the matrix dimensions. Simple modifications are noted for transposing complex/double precision and packed integer matrices. Experimental results are presented comparing the times needed for transposition using optimal partitioning and powers-of-2 partitioning. It is found in the cases tested that a speed gain of up to 5.55 is obtained by optimizing the partition sizes."
"A new method for correction of two's, complement adders characteristics at the output of the multiplier following the adders is proposed. It is very suitable to ordinary pipe-line implementation."
"This correspondence describes a method of dividing a picture into differently textured regions by thresholding the values of a suitable local picture property. The approach used is a generalization to natural textures of a technique recently proposed by Tsuji. The examples given involve textures that differ in coarseness; a method of estimating texture coarseness by analysis of local property values is also described."
"This correspondence develops a multiplier for two's complement numbers, similar to the quasi-serial multiplier which operates on sign magnitude numbers. The method offers an alternative to add shift techniques for low cost two's complement multiplication."
"The problem of scheduling tasks on a system of independent identical processors is discussed and the performance of a suboptimal method is evaluated. The computation is modeled by an acyclic directed graph G(T,<), where node set T represents the set of tasks to be completed and edge set < defines the precedence between tasks. The objective is to minimize the finishing time of the computation graph. Known theoretical results are reviewed and a general branch-and-bound algorithm for finding optimal solutions is presented. The schedules produced by a simple critical path priority method are shown to be near optimal for randomly generated computation graphs."

"Hopcroft and Tarjan [2] have recently proposed an algorithm that runs in linear time for testing the planarity of a graph. The technique finds a representation of the graph as a sequence of paths and then iteratively imbeds these paths to find a mesh structure, rearranging the meshes as needed to accommodate each new path. Demoucron et al. [1] have shown that this rearrangement process is unnecessary if the paths are considered in the proper order. The present implementation is found to run in linear time for most ordinary cases, about twice as fast as Tarjan's Algol implementation. A graph of 3000 vertices and 8994 edges required about 18 s."
"An algorithm is given for synthesizing a computer program from a trace of its behavior. Since the algorithm involves a search, the length of time required to do the synthesis of nontrivial programs can be quite large. Techniques are given for preprocessing the trace information to reduce enumeration, for pruning the search using a failure memory technique, and for utilizing multiple traces to the best advantage. The results of numerous tests are given to demonstrate the value of the techniques."
"Different notations have been proposed over the years to describe register transfer (RT) systems. They have met with varying degrees of success and to provide a direct comparison of them is a difficult task. One of the reasons for this is the different views of the RT level of design held by the proponents of the languages."
"Some formal models for pattern-sensitive faults (PSF's) in random-access memories are presented. The problem of detecting unrestricted PSF's is that of constructing a checking sequence for the memory. An efficient procedure for constructing such a checking sequence is presented. A local PSF is defined as a PSF where the faulty behavior of a memory cell Cidepends on a fixed group of cells called the neighborhood of Ci. Neighborhoods are divided into two classes, open and closed. Test generation methods are described for local PSF's defined on both open and closed neighborhoods. The detection of PSF's when only one memory cell is faulty (single PSF's) is also discussed."
"In this paper, issues concerning feature patterns in terms of both feature composition and feature interdependence are discussed, and the concepts of typicality and diversity of an ensemble are formulated. The features of the specimens investigated are organized in a two-dimensional array, called an observation matrix, with each row vector representing the ordered set of features of a specimen. An algorithm (based upon the proposed measures and statistical screening) is implemented for extracting feature patterns. In the algorithm, schemes for feature patterns and specimen reweighting are proposed to optimize the utilization of available information in the array, and to minimize possible bias caused by the uneven sampling of the ensemble. Two sets of real world data in the environmental and molecular biology areas are used to exemplify the physical meaning of the proposed measures as well as to demonstrate the operational feasibility and significance of this methodology in analyzing homologous ensemble which is subject to variable degrees of diversity."
"In this paper a structure for a contextual cursive script recognition system is presented. This system makes use of letter context to determine word length, letter segmentation, and character identity to achieve contextual recognition at the word level. The system consists of a character recognizer that presents a set of best alternatives for each character to a contextual postprocessor whose task it is to determine the correct word."
"The application of microprogrammed READ-ONLY memories in the design of asynchronous sequential networks is investigated. Variations of single-transition time (STT) state assignments are shown to be applicable to the problem of assigning memory addresses to a memory representation of an asynchronous network. Design algorithms are developed which allow the implementation of an asynchronous sequential network as a READ-ONLY memory. Two operating modes are considered: normal asynchronous operation and a self-clocked mode in which sequential outputs are allowed on a single-input change, thus providing a means of implementing functions normally achieved with synchronous (clocked) networks. In addition the practical timing constraints of the proposed methods are considered."
"In this correspondence we show the existence of a Reed-Muller like expansion for multivalued functions. We establish that any m-variable, N-valued function [mi]f(xm,xm-1,...x1[/mi]) can be expressed as [mi]Co+ C1x1+ *--+ + CNm_1xmN-1xm-1N-1x1N-1[/mi]. A matrix method for determining the coefficients of these expansions is presented. The problem of finding minimal expression for a given function is discussed. Finally, we present a new technique for realizing multiple output functions."
"We show that a low-cost arithmtetic code with group length n detects all unidirectional multiple errors that affect fewer than n bits, as well as a larger class of such errors confined to a restricted set of bit positions."
"A representation for binary coded ternary (BCT) numbers is proposed. This representation is then used for the introduction of algorithms for ternary addition and subtraction on binary hardware. In the algorithm introduced, distinction is made between basic algorithms, i.e., those which are independent of the type of the arithmetic, and those which are dependent upon it. Some suggestions as to the significance of this approach for nonternary arithmetic are presented."
"Cascades of only three different primitive 3-3 magnetic bubble logic circuits are shown to realize 29 of the 31 equivalence classes of such circuits. The results are compared with earlier realizations using a set of 15 primitives."
"By using two magnetic-bubble positions per bit it is possible to develop simple logical circuits which display essentially unlimited fan-in and fan-out. Systems of these circuits can be organized such that they conserve bubbles. Pipelining methods can be employed to enhance the throughput."
"This correspondence suggests an improved characterization of Boolean functions based on parameters, for unate cascade (UC) realizability. Using this characterization, UC realizability can be readily tested and arrays of UC's can be synthesized to realize arbitrary Boolean functions."
"These comments point out first that the difficulties encountered in a recent paper1in applying the theorems of Boolean algebra to a multivalued system using max and min functions are not due to the type of complement that is chosen, but due to the attempt to deqne a multivalued Boolean algebra using the max and min functions which are not Boolean functions except in the 2-valued case; and second, that the three types of complement defined are well known in the context of multivalued non-Boolean algebras."
"The above comments on our previous paper are two-fold: first that the choice of min and max functions is inappropriate since, in general, these functions are not Boolean; and second that Definitions 1, 2, and 3 are equivalent to existing definitions in mathematical literature."
"This is an introductory textbook in the sense that it assumes no other background than elementary college mathematics plus some familiarity with a programming language. However, a good part of the treatment is at an advanced level and assumes a certain degree of mathematical maturity. A large number of detailed examples and problems are also included. This not only facilitates the introduction of various concepts but also illustrates how they can be used to solve specific problems. I find it the strongest advantage of the book."
"This book contains a very comprehensive coverage of material suitable for course B2 of the ACM curriculum recommendations."
"People have been taking digs at my work for many years, and I have taken no recourse to reply. The review in the May 1974 issue of the IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS issue by Professor Barnard seems highly unfair and does not clearly consider the position of an author describing a changing technology. He should understand something of the publishing field and that it takes at least two years to research and write a book; to have the book reviewed by the publisher, to revise it, and to get it into production takes another two years; and, finally, to get the book reviewed takes another year. One of the reviewer's most devastating criticisms is that the material is five years old. From the above time-table how could I possibly publish information on current machines? How could I ever catchup?"
"Problems in Publishing Current Information: In his rebuttal, Professor Flores stresses the difficulty of publishing an up-to-date book. However, in his 1972 review (IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS, December 1972) of Katzan's book, Flores complained \"My curiosity about the 3330 disk system was not satisfied.\" Katzan had allocated about 5 pages of his 1971 book to a discussion of the IBM 3330 system, including the \"rotational position sensing\" and \"multiple requesting\" features. Professor Flores now explains to us that his own book, published two years later, cannot be expected to cover these same items, because of the \"constraint of time and necessity!\""

 "This paper considers codes with radix r > 2 which are capable of correcting arbitrary arithmetic errors in any radix r digit. If each radix r digit represents a byte of b binary digits (e.g., r = 2b), these codes correct any combination of errors occurring in the b binary digits of any single byte. A theoretical basis for these codes is presented, along with practical considerations regarding their applicability."
"An algorithm for generating test sets to detect all the multiple stuck-at-faults in combinational logic circuits is presented. This algorithm generates a test set using a set of functions, called representative functions, which consists of much fewer functions than all possible multiple stuck-at fault functions, but is sufficient for test generation. Two different methods of finding such a set of representative functions are presented. The test sets derived from the set of representative functions obtained by the first method will be smaller than that by the second method, but the second method is much simpler than the first especially for highly redundant circuits. Nevertheless, the complexity of this algorithm using the first method is about the same as that of Bossen and Hong's algorithm which is the simplest existing algorithm under the multiple stuck-at fault assumption, and yet the number of tests in a test set generated will always be smaller for redundant circuits and the same for irredundant circuits as that generated by Bossen and Hong's algorithm for irredundant circuits."
"We look at several variations of the single fault detection problem for combinational logic circuits and show that deciding whether single faults are detectable by input-output (I/O) experiments is polynomially complete, i.e., there is a polynomial time algorithm to decide if these single faults are detectable if and only if there is a polynomial time algorithm for problems such as the traveling salesman problem, knapsack problem, etc."
"Logic-in-memory (LIM) organization allows central processor functions of computing systems to be combined with memory in regular arrays. The cells of these arrays can themselves be constructed regularly and economically using similar two-level emitter-function logic (EFL) structures. The structure is a development of current-mode logic and it permits the large-scale integration (LSI) realization of three levels of logic with similar silicon area and power dissipation to a single conventional emitter-coupled logic (ECL) gate. It also permits the realization of a D latch in a single structure. The capability of the structure is demonstrated in examples of LIM data transfer and sorting arrays."
"A family of switching networks, called \"arithmetic networks,\" is investigated. The elementary units of these networks are generalizations of full adders that can process input signals of different weights."
"A new method for the extraction of features in a two-class pattern recognition problem is derived. The main advantage is that the method for selecting features is based entirely upon discrimination or separability as opposed to the more common approach of fitting. The classical example of fitting is the use of the eigenvectors of the lumped covariance matrix corresponding to the largest eigenvalues. In an analogous manner, the new technique selects discriminant vectors (or features) corresponding to the largest \"discrim-values.\" The new method is compared to some of the more popular alternative techniques via both data-dependent and mathematical examples. In addition, a recursive method for obtaining the discriminant vectors is given."
"A condition for separation of two categories by a pattern-recognition network formed by an array of threshold logic units (TLU) and an additional decision element is discussed. The array implements a set of hyperplanes that partition the sample space, and the array outputs and the sample vector elements form the input to the decision element. It is shown that this input is separable by a convex surface if, in each of the cells in the partition, the convex hull of the first-category vectors in that cell does not intersect with the convex hull of the second-category vectors in that cell. When the TLU outputs can be set to zero by another TLU in the array, a comparison shows that the network capacity can be significantly increased. A sufficient condition for the array outputs to be in general position is described. An algorithm is suggested that places the hyperplanes so that equal error rates occur on both sides. This property tends to more finely partition regions with overlap between categories."
"Magleby [6] proved that there can exist at most two adjacencies between a pair of cycles of a pure circulating register. We give a theorem (Theorem 1) for construction of all such pairs of cycles, and our theorem enables us to count them."
"Limitations which are placed on input and clock signals of single and double-rank synchronous sequential circuits with memory composed of level-triggered flip-flops are presented and compared with the results of Unger [1] and Curtis [2]."
"A new method of description of a straight line defined on a square grid is presented. The discrete equation of the straight line (desl) is introduced as an extension of the classical Cartesian equation, and applies to straight lines quantized on a grid by the grid intersect method. The desl includes a set of intercepts which can be scanned in proper order to generate the chain for the given straight line."
"A scheme for computing the Walsh-Fourier transform of noisy data is presented. The results are insensitive to isolated noise points, even when their magnitudes are large."
"Observations are made on the effect of pipelining iterative arrays for multiplication. It is suggested that the best type of latched array for multiplication is the save-carry iterative array. The effect of pipelining on other iterative arrays, including the general multiply/divide array is discussed."
"This correspondence presents generalized higher radix algorithms for some elementary functions which use fast parallel m-bit multipliers where radix = 2m. These algorithms are extensions of those iterative schemes which are based on multiplications by (1 + 2-i) and the use of prestored values of ln (1 + 2-i) and tan-1(2-i). The particular functions under consideration are y/x, y/x1/2, y. exp (x), y + 1n (x), sin (x) and cos (x) [and hence tan (x)]. The extended algorithms rely on multiplication by (1 + dir-k) where di, 0 ≤ dir, is an m-bit integer. Using a simple selection procedure for di, simulations show that p(radix r) digits of a function may be generated, on the average, in less than p + 1 iterations."
"Circuits for performing arithmetic operations using base –2 representations are considered. Study of the counting process leads to a negative binary up-down counter and new simple methods for positive-negative base conversions. The advantage of employing carry-borrow rather than carry-only during additions is pointed out. Certain special features of negation, arithmetic shift, multiplication, and division in base –2 are described."
"A technique is described which makes use of a hardware computer interface to efficiently extract zero-crossing interval information from continuous time signals. Each zero-crossing of the input waveform causes the contents of a clock register to be transferred into a clock buffer register simultaneously with the generation of a computer interrupt. Following this, the clock register is restarted and further zero-crossings are prohibited from affecting the device for a set length of time. This length of time is preset to disallow the interruption of the computer until the present zero-crossing interval can be processed. The interrupted computer may read the clock buffer register which represents the elapsed time between the previous two zero-crossings. Since this method results in the measurement of zero-crossing interval information with a minimum computer involvement, a given computer can spend a maximum amount of time processing zero-crossing interval data. An implementation of the technique for use with a PDP-8/L computer is discussed."
"This correspondence considers three-level AND/OR gate realizations for T or more of N symmetric functions and gives a design procedure. The procedure can be used to design relatively large networks. The three-level realizations require substantially fewer test patterns for fault detection, gates, and gate inputs than the minimum two-level network. For example, the minimum two-level network for the 3 or more out of 12 functions requires 286 test patterns, 67 gates, and 726 gate inputs while the three-level realization presented requires 27 test patterns, 25 gates, and 96 gate inputs."
"I was amazed to see in the February 1974 issue of the TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS such an inept review of Principles of Interactive Computer Graphics, by Robert Sproull and myself. There must be serious faults in your procedures both for choosing reviewers and for monitoring their efforts, if reviews as worthless as Dr. Biberman's are allowed to reach the printed page."
"I am indeed sorry the authors are upset about my review of their book, Principles of Interactive Computer Graphics. My review should not have surprised you or the authors since I sent advance copies via the publisher to each of them. I was not happy to write the review and twice, as you recall, I attempted to withdraw."

"IN introducing what some may consider an unusual special issue, it is appropriate to recall that at the 1967 Fall Joint Computer Conference, the name of this journal was changed from IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRONIC COMPUTERS to IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS. This Special Issue on Optical Computing aptly reflects the broad aspects of computing for which this journal was intended."
"An optical-digital computer (ODC) that enables parallel processing of images is discussed. A number of optical and analog electronic preprocessing operations are described. These include the use of the texture variance to separate objects in an image on the basis of texture, application of autocorrelation techniques to find hidden periodicities in images, masking on the basis of color, Fourier analysis, and planimetric analysis of color scenes. A particular design of an ODC is discussed. The computer consists of an optical system, an image analyzer, a bandwidth compressor and digitizer, and a digital computer. A number of applications are furnished. Emphasis is given to processing aerial and radiographic imagery."
"A real-time two-dimensional hybrid processor consisting of a coherent optical system, an optical/digital interface, and a PDP-11/15 control minicomputer is described. The input electrical-to-optical transducer is an electron-beam addressed potassium dideuterium phosphate (KD2PO4) light valve. The requirements and hardware for the output optical-to-digital interface, which is constructed from modular computer building blocks, are presented. Initial experimental results demonstrating the operation of this hybrid processor in phased array radar data processing, synthetic aperture image correlation, and text correlation are included. The applications chosen emphasize the role of the interface in the analysis of data from an optical processor and possible extensions to the digital feedback control of an optical processor."
"An automated procedure involving both optical and computer processing steps is being developed as a means for easing the growing burden associated with manual preparation and manual searching of ten print fingerprint card files. A description of this technique is presented along with results recently obtained during a monitored test using a 10 000 fingerprint card library."
"This paper describes how, in spite of occasional performance limitations generally due to process defects, large-area solid-state image sensors can be applied to scan pictorial data. First, it is estimated to what extent the direct imaging of pictorial matter onto a defective area-scanning device for acceptable scanning quality is possible. A novel concept is then proposed in which the optically generated Fourier-transform hologram of a picture rather than the picture itself is imaged onto a defective solid-state photosensitive array, scanned, digitized, filtered, and reconstructed by fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques on a digital processor. The operating principle is discussed and the effects of scanner defects, digitization, and filtering on the scanning quality are investigated by computer simulation."
"Microwave imaging of anomalies, such as voids or discontinuities, in optically opaque regions is described. Images were reconstructed with two techniques. The experimental technique utilized laser light for reconstructions from detour phase holograms that encoded data measured in the region of Fresnel diffraction. Examples of images are presented for smooth and rough interfaces. The numerical reconstruction technique was based on the angular spectrum technique, and an approximate propagator was derived to describe propagation through two, homogeneous dielectric layers to one anomaly. Image quality was acceptable for either reconstruction method, but the optically reconstructed images are rather small because scale reduction is limited in practice."
"Conventional methods of displaying three-dimensional information in X-ray diagnostics like tomography or tomosynthesis are not capable of imaging fast moving objects because of the time-sequential recording process. To overcome this difficulty the method of coded aperture imaging using nonredundant point distributions is applied to X-ray imaging. The object coded by an array of X-ray sources is deconvoluted by means of an optical processing system using monochromatic, but spatially incoherent light. Experimental results obtained with simple objects show good resolution in detail as well as in depth. Moreover, an on-line system has been simulated using coded images on X-ray films with a TV-camera pick up in conjunction with an electrooptic relay tube."
"System performance is substantially enhanced by using good attenuators in the system and employing a pulsing mode of operation. Spurious image elements, due to multiple reflections of the ultrasound in the acoustic cell and due to echoes from elements in the system which are not part of the object plane being imaged, can be eliminated in this fashion. In addition, depth discrimination can be substantially improved, in agreement with theory."
"Binary patterns electrically set into a 12 element PLZT line composer have been recorded on a thermoplastic-photoconductor recording medium as Fourier transform (FT) holograms. A short description of the line composer, thermoplastic-photoconductive recording medium and optical system is given as background information for the experimental results. The reconstructed patterns show contrast ratios of 40:1."
"Numerous parallel processing capabilities of holography have been described [1], [2]. Certain of these which are inherent in a (holographic) synthetic aperture radar [3]-[7] have also been discussed [8], including its parallel (simultaneous) phase curvature adjustments for all near-field reflecting objects, and its automatic (and parallel) adjustment of the (synthetic) aperture size so as to cause the metric resolution to be independent of range. It is here suggested that a real-time hologram reconstruction tube [9] could be incorporated to advantage in certain synthetic aperture systems."
"Holographic Fourier spectroscopy has been extended to ultrasonic radiation. A recently developed acoustical-to-optical conversion cell (AOCC) was used to display the spectroscopic hologram. Real-time optical Fourier transformation of the ultrasonic interferogram can be obtained."
"A coherent-optical reading method for Optical Character Recognition Set A [OCR(A)]-numerics is derived modifying a customary coding method which has been used in optical correlators that feature signal input via ultrasonic light modulators for time compression of radar pulses. It is shown by computer simulation that unambiguous recognition of these numerics will be possible if combined application of masks for the numeric codes and matched auxiliary masks for significant features are realized.1"
"Parallel image processing shows certain general similarities to retinal processing and shares with optical computing the characteristics of parallelism. Simulation on digital serial computers (DSC's), although possible in the simpler cases, very soon becomes almost uncontrollable, requiring large memories and very long programming and execution times. Advances in present circuit technology now permit one to construct large arrays of interconnected parallel ogic elements resulting in real-time parallel machines where the action of a statement is simultaneous on all the points of the array. A typical processor of this kind is briefly described and an introduction to its code is given. Examples of symmetrical and directional functions and parallel algorithms are also presented. Possible applications of such processors in image processing, pattern recognition, and artificial intelligence are briefly discussed."
"A coherent optical Fourier transform system is studied for which masks of curves only are used as input. A general theory for this problem is discussed, resulting in the functional connection between input and output data and limitations due to thickness, curvature, and extension of the curve. The general result can be simplified for a curve which represents a signal modulated by a carrier. In this case the Fourier transform of the signal can be found optically in first-order diffraction. The method is applied to interferogram curves arising in Fourier spectroscopy."
"The feasibility of nonlinear optical data processing with photochromic materials is analyzed. It is shown that a host of useful computations may be achieved by incorporating nonlinear optical elements (transparencies) into conventional optical data processing channels."
"A unified approach to interferometry, holography, and the seeing problem is presented. Known interferometric techniques are arranged hierarchically and the concept of the \"order\" of an interferometer is introduced. When an interferometer is viewing a spatially incoherent object through a randomly fluctuating medium, it is argued that the field of view over which the observed data are isoplanatic depends upon the way in which the data are processed, and the processing methods depend upon the order of the interferometer. By appealing to the principles of Michelson interferometry, intensity interferometry, compound intensity interferometry, off-set holography, and the decomposition of observed radiation into its spatial frequency spectrum, it is found that a convenient characterization can be made of the conditions whereby objects can either be resolved (i.e., the sizes of the objects can be determined) or be imaged faithfully."

"FAULT-TOLERANT computing has been defined as \"the ability to execute specified algorithms correctly regardless of hardware failures, total system flaws, or program fallacies\" [1]. To the extent that a system falls short of meeting the requirements of this definition, it can be labeled a partially fault-tolerant system [2]. Thus the definition of fault-tolerant computing provides a standard against which to measure all systems having a degree of fault tolerance. In particular, one can classify systems according to: 1), the amount of manual intervention required in performing three basic functions, and 2) the class of faults covered by three basic functions involved in fault tolerance: system validation, fault diagnosis, and fault masking or recovery. The word \"fault\" here is used to inclusively describe \"failures, flaws, and fallacies\" in the original definition. The first function is involved in the design and production of the system hardware and software, while the last two functions are embodied in the system itself. Likewise, the first function is directed to handling faults arising from design and production errors, whereas the last two functions are aimed at faults due to random hardware failures."
"A procedure for the diagnosis of intermittent faults in combinational circuits is suggested. This procedure employs a probabilistic model for intermittent failures and presumes that a detection experiment has been run. The circuit is assumed to be irredundant and to possess a single fault out of n possible ones. The approach suggested is based on the repeated application of tests that test for these faults had their effect been permanent. A subset of the test set is selected and is repeatedly applied until a failure is observed. Similar subexperiments are then run with appropriate test subsets until the highest diagnostic resolution is obtained. The expected length of the diagnosis experiment is guaranteed to be finite. This is shown by proving that the expected length of each subexperiment is finite. The diagnosis experiment can be terminated, when any preset time limit is exceeded, compromising the obtained diagnostic resolution. Local symmetry of the fault table is found to be the necessary and sufficient condition for maximum diagnostic resolution."
"A formal model for the study of on-line diagnosis is introduced and used to investigate the diagnosis of unrestricted faults. Within this model a fault of a system S is considered to be a transformation of S into another system S' at some time r. The resulting faulty system is taken to be the system which looks like S up to time r and like S' thereafter. Notions of fault tolerance and error are defined in terms of the resulting system being able to mimic some desired behavior as specified by a system S. A notion of on-line diagnosis is formulated which involves an external detector and a maximum time delay within which every error caused by a fault in a prescribed set must be detected."
"An important problem in fault detection is to verify whether a single-fault test set is able to detect all multiple-faults. This paper provides a solution to the above problem. It is known that a test set derived for the detection of some fault may fail this purpose in the presence of an additional fault. This phenomenon is called masking among faults, and is of great importance in the derivation of a test set which detects all multiple-faults. This paper investigates the masking relations among faults in a combinational logic circuit. For this purpose a transform for the circuit is defined and a model for fault analysis is constructed. This transform and model reduce the number of faults which have to be considered in order to achieve the detection of all multiple-faults. An algebraic procedure yields the derivation of the masking relations. A problem which arises, namely the existence of a set of faults forming a loop of masking relations is considered. An application is presented: starting with a test set derived under the single-fault assumption it is shown how to extend this test set so that it detects all multiple-faults. All of the results in this paper are valid for general multiple-output circuits. For simplicity in the exposition, the single-output case is examined."
"Periodic signals have a known behavior, and deviations in their waveforms may indicate failures in the signal source. Monitoring these signals can be a valuable technique in detecting both hardware and software failures in a computer. Schemes previously used to check for errors in these signals are reviewed and evaluated. These circuits, however, share a common weakness in that they are susceptible to undetectable internal faults. Described here is a self-checking periodic-signal checker; that is, the checker is capable of indicating the occurrence of any error in the input signal and failures in the checker itself. Applications of the checker in aspects of computer operation as well as a fail-safe circuit for communicating the detection of an error to an external observer are presented."
"Advances in integrated circuit technology are decreasing acquisition cost per function of digital hardware while system software costs are increasing. The hardware advances allow practical implementation of more sophisticated and complex systems which have fewer components, but which may present severe test and maintenance problems due to their complexity. As a result, the use of built-in test (BIT) hardware in place of software becomes increasingly attractive. The Navy funded Advanced Avionics Fault Isolation System (AAFIS) concept utilizes BIT logic for cost-effective fault detection and fault isolation to a digital subsystem and to the faulty module therein. Added logic, available at low cost with advanced microelectronics, is used to perform test pattern generation in each subsystem and to code over the test sequence the outputs and test points on each subsystem module. The coded test response is compared to a predetermined constant. The OR of resulting module pass-fail signals indicates subsystem faults, while identification of a module fail signal provides isolation to a faulty module. Practical coding techniques are presented, with tradeoff of speed, test effectiveness and logic requirements for each. BIT logic design and simulation results verify high fault detection and moderate added logic for BIT."
"A hybrid-redundant multiprocessor is proposed in which each processing unit and each memory module is triplicated for purposes of error detection and momentary error masking Reconfiguration allows spare units to replace failed units and allows surviving units to regroup after spares have been exhausted. An arbitrary number of processing units and memory modules can be accommodated. A hybrid-redundant bus system interconnects the processors and memories, where the initial redundancy of the buses is a design parameter. A specialized circuit called a bus guardian unit (BGU) is employed in numerous places to control reconfiguration and testing in such a way as to eliminate susceptibility to failure events that occur in one module at a time. Considerable emphasis is placed on dynamic testing. This approach is briefly compared to other fault-tolerant computer systems."
"A damage-and fault-tolerant input/output (I/O) network is presented as an alternative to I/O buses. Such a network differs most significantly from telecommunications networks (such as the ARPA net) in that the nodes of this net are very simple and do not perform such tasks as message or packet switching and buffering. Data routing through the net is directly controlled by a centralized processor with control algorithms being implemented in software. Descriptions of both the network hardware and the most vital points of the control software are provided. It is believed that this network construction represents both an economically viable alternative to data buses and a significant improvement in reliability and survivability, particularly in those applications where physical damage to elements of the I/O system is a possibility, such as in aircraft, shipboard, rapid transit, and industrial situations."
"When errors occur which exceed the correction capability of an error correcting code, the only recourse to restore the original memory function is to physically replace the failed entity. In this paper the authors propose an automatic reconfiguration technique which uses the concept of address skewing to disperse such multiple errors into correctable errors. No additional redundancy other than that required for the error correcting code is needed. The skewing mechanism is derived using the theory of orthogonal Latin squares."
"A model for analyzing the reliability of gracefully degrading and standby-sparing computer systems is developed. The basis of the model is the identification of four distinct causes of crashes: time-domain multiple faults, resource exhaustion, space-domain multiple faults, and solitary faults. Expressions are developed for each of these crash-causing mechanisms and for their interrelationship. The model is then demonstrated by using it to analyze the reliability of a gracefully degrading computer system called PRIME."
"The classical reliability model for N-modular redundancy (NMR) assumes the network to be failed when a majority of modules which drive the same voter fail. It has long been known that this model is pessimistic since there are instances, termed compensating module failures, where a majority of the modules fail but the network is nonfailed. A different module reliability model based on lead reliability is proposed which has the classical NMR reliability model as a special case. Recent results from the area of test generation are employed to simplify the module reliability calculation under the lead reliability model. First a fault equivalent technique, based on functional equivalence of faults, is developed to determine the effect of compensating module failures on system reliability. This technique can increase the predicted mission time (the time the system is to operate at or above a given reliability) by at least 40 percent over the classical model prediction for simple networks. Since the fault equivalent technique is too complex for modeling of large circuits a second, computational simpler technique, based on fault dominance, is derived. It is then shown to yield results comparable to the fault equivalent technique. A more complex example circuit analyzed by the fault dominance model shows at least a 75 percent improvement in mission time due to modeling compensating module failures. A commercialy available 31 gate integrated circuit chip is also modeled to demonstrate the applicability of the technique to large circuits."
"The paper discusses two methods to evaluate the signal reliability of the output of logical circuits. It is known that faults present in a circuit will not always cause the output of the circuit to be incorrect. Given the probability of faults occurring in the circuit and the probabilities of the input combinations, it is possible to determine the likelihood of the output being correct. The signal reliability of the output is thus defined as the probability that the circuit output is correct. The first method evaluates the contribution of each fault to the reliability of the circuit and requires the enumeration of the behavior of each fault in the entire fault set. The use of McCluskey and Clegg's characterization of faulty networks by evaluating the functional equivalence classes of the network is a way to reduce the amount of computation involved. Lower bounds can be obtained by considering a restricted fault set, for example, the single fault set. The second method uses a probabilistic model of logical circuits and consists of straightforward operations which can easily be automated. The method also yields the signal reliability and has the capability of very easily specifying the individual fault probabilities of all the circuit lines independently."
"A hypothetical computer is described, and procedures are indicated for showing the correctness of its microprogram. The underlying method used is that of Birman [1]. However, the computer discussed has some realistic characteristics not shared by the machine treated in [1], and the details of the microcode validation are complicated by this fact. A formal technique for partitioning the proof is presented and illustrated with examples."
"A methodology for generating program test data is described. The methodology is a model of the test data generation process and can be used to characterize the basic problems of test data generation. It is well defined and can be used to build an automatic test data generation system."
"A compatibility relationship on network paths is defined in such a way that the maximal compatibles are isomorphic to the products in the \"structure and parity-observing output function\" (SPOOF), a subscripted Boolean expression for the network output that uniquely specifies the network structure. For a given network, the path compatibility relations are easy to find, as are the maximal compatibles and hence the SPOOF for the network output. Because the collection of all the path compatibility relations, conveniently displayed in matrix form, completely characterizes the network, the compatibility matrix can be used for a variety of purposes."
"Two different test methods, specific to two control mechanisms in a logic network are presented. These methods, in fact, correspond to two levels of complexity and therefore to two kinds of hardware realizations. The main considerations will be the following."
"Fail-safe synchronous sequential machines produce safeside outputs when failures occur within the machine. This correspondence presents a procedure to design such machines using a modification of the on-set equation form originally presented by Tohma et al. [1] and later improved by Diaz et al. [2]. A systematic procedure for state assignment and next-state equation derivation, using partition theory, is presented. From this method an easily calculated upper bound on the number of gates required-to realize a fail-safe circuit is derived."
"The effects of transient failures in sequential modules in systems using triple modular redundancy (TMR) cannot be neglected. A transient may place a sequential machine in an erroneous state, and the state may remain erroneous long after the transient has disappeared. We show that the state of a sequential machine can be restored after a transient if and only if the machine has a synchronizing sequence. If synchronizing sequences occur periodically during normal operation of the system, then multiple transients spaced out in time can be tolerated. System structures that have synchronizing sequences are discussed."
"A probabilistic treatment of general combinational networks has been developed. Using the notions of the probability of a signal and signal independence, algorithms have been presented to calculate the probability of the output of a logic circuit being 1. Simplifications to the algorithm result when sets of input probabilities are given the same value, and this process called bundling is described in the paper. Finally, a series of examples illustrate the application of the probabilistic approach to the analysis of faulty logic circuits."
"A combinatorial procedure is given to calculate the reliability of an interwoven redundant logic network to any desired degree of accuracy. The procedure consists of enumerating combinations of gate failure which are tolerated by the redundant network, and is explained with reference to a quadded logic network. Since the exact reliability calculation might be too time consuming for large networks, a formula is given for a lower bound which can be used in conjunction with the exact method to give a very accurate reliability figure with a comparatively small computation time."

"A digital computer algorithm is developed for on-line time differentiation of sampled analog voltage signals. The derivative is obtained by employing a least mean squares technique. The recursive algorithm results in a considerable reduction in computer time compared to a complete new solution of the normal equations each time a new data point is accepted. Implementations of the algorithm on a digital computer is discussed. Examples are simulated on a DEC PDP-8 computer."
"Function approximation by a finite Walsh series is considered. There are two methods for selecting the terms of a series. The process of threshold sampling gives a least-square error approximation, but no error analysis technique is available. However, error analysis is possible if terms are selected according to degrees and subdegrees. It is shown that truncation is equivalent to dropping all terms with degrees greater than some amount. The error caused is a weighted integral of the first derivative, and an upper bound on the expression can be derived. It is also shown that a truncated Walsh series corresponds to a simple function table. Data compression is equivalent to dropping terms with large enough subdegrees, with an estimable error. After a Walsh series has been selected, it is possible to modify the coefficients using Lawson's algorithm and reduce the maximum error."
"The ease of simulating a dyadic model on digital computers suggests approximating linear time-invariant (LTI) systems by dyadic models. Methods for calculating the best such approximations are provided. It is shown that the matrices characterizing the LTI system and its optimal dyadic approximant have identical diagonal elements in the Walsh domain. This fact is used to derive a direct transformation between the impulse-response function of an LTI system and that of its dyadic approximant. The transformation can be accomplished in less than N log N additions."
"The interaction problem between asynchronous logic elements is formulated with emphasis on the synchronizer. A detailed analytic treatment of the binary flip-flop action in the metastable region is presented. The principle result is to predict, in a probabilistic manner, the time necessary to move from the metastable point to one of the stable boundaries. The effects of circuit time constant and circuit noise are discussed in detail. Theoretical results are correlated with laboratory measurements and suggestions for acceptable probability of error performance are given."
"A technique for the quantitative evaluation of edge detection schemes is presented. It is used to assess the performance of three such schemes using a specially-generated set of images containing noise. The ability of human subjects to distinguish the edges in the presence of noise is also measured and compared with that of the edge detection schemes. The edge detection schemes are used on a high-resolution satellite photograph with varying degrees of noise added in order to relate the quantitative comparison to real-life imagery."
"Canonical forms for m-valued functions referred to as m-Reed–Muller canonical (m-RMC) forms that are a generalization of RMC forms of two-valued functions are proposed. m-RMC forms are based on the operations ⊕m (addition mod m) and .m (multiplication mod m) and do not, as in the cases of the generalizations proposed in the literature, require an m-valued function for m not a power of a prime, to be expressed by a canonical form for M-valued functions, where M > m is a power of a prime. Methods of obtaining the m-RMC forms from the truth vector or the sum of products representation of an m-valued function are discussed. Using a generalization of the Boolean difference to m-valued logic, series expansions for m-valued functions are derived."
"A technique for decomposition of polygons into simpler components is described and illustrated with applications in the analysis of handwritten Chinese characters and chromosomes. Polygonal approximations of such objects are obtained by methods described in the literature and then parts of their concave angles are examined recursively for separating convex or other simple shape components. Further decomposition of the latter is possible. The final result can be expressed as a labeled graph and processed further through the introduction of either fuzzy predicates or syntactic pattern recognition techniques."
"An algorithm is presented in which a computer is visually shown a sequence of views of a solid planar object as the object is rotated in space. The computer automatically forms a three-dimensional description of the object. The description consists of a deterministic description of the object's surfaces and how they are interconnected to form the object, along with a measure of each surface's shape which is invariant to three-dimensional rotation. From this self-learned model of the object, the object can later be recognized from any viewing angle. The basis of the algorithm is the ability of the program to determine in a specific visual view: \"What do I see now that I have seen before?\" This is accomplished by generating two sets of mappings of one object description to another object description."
"A model of noise deformation of the substitution type is adopted for linguistic patterns generated by formal grammars. The maximum-likelihood criterion and the minimum-distance criterion are proposed for the classification of noisy strings described by context-free grammars. Classification algorithms based on a modified Cocke-Younger-Kasami parsing scheme are presented."
"In this correspondence two methods are given for calculating the probability that the output of a general combinational network is 1 given the probabilities for each input being 1. We define the notions of the probability of a signal and signal independence. Then several proofs are given to show the relationship between Boolean operations and algebraic operations upon probabilities. As a result of these, two simple algorithms are presented for calculating output probabilities. An example of the usefulness of these results is given with respect to the generation of tests for the purpose of fault detection."
"The least upper bound of n(n−1)/2 input symbols is derived for the total length of characterizing sequences for a reduced n-state machine. When a machine can be characterized by a set of r characterizing sequences, a reduced upper bound on their total length will be r(2n−r−1)/2 input symbols. To shorten transfer sequences, better use is made of the strong-connectedness assumptions of the machines to be tested. The reduced bounds on characterizing and transfer sequences are utilized to improve the upper bounds on checking experiments employing simple input/output (I/O) sequences."
"There are several available algorithms suitable for training a linear pattern classifier. Fixed-increment algorithms are commonly used because they are easily coded for computer applications. This correspondence presents a modified fixed-increment algorithm that expedites classifier training and yet mantains the basic structure of the traditional fixed-increment algorithm. In applications with medical data, use of the new algorithm has resulted in a savings of approximately 35 percent im classifier-training time."
"Fail-safe circuits are designed to assume a 1 (1-fail-safe) or a 0 (0-fail-safe) output state upon failure. This correspondence extends fault detection techniques previously presented [1] to include the design of fail-safe asynchronous sequential circuits. Faults causing failures in the internal state logic and the output state logic circuitry are treated. These failures are assumed to be symmetric and the resulting circuit realizations require less hardware than realizations derived from previously presented techniques."
"In the solution of the Laplace equation using finite difference methods, the iteration is often started with all interior points set equal to zero. It has been found that providing initial estimates for the potentials at these interior points can reduce the number of iterations required to reach convergence. This paper presents a technique which is easy to program and may reduce the total computation time significantly."

"In this paper, the number of functions realized by certain networks of two-input one-output gates are presented. Two networks are considered; one is the disjunctive network, which is characterized by the restriction that each gate output and each network input connect to exactly one gate input. The other network, the cascade, is the special case of the disjunctive networks in which each gate has at least one input which connects to a network input. For both networks, a recursion relation is derived for the number of realized switching functions dependent on exactly k variables. Both expressions have been solved by computer for k up to 15. Also, expressions are derived for the number of functions realized by cascades and disjunctive networks of two-input one-output cells, where each cell realizes any of the 16 functions on two variables."
"In this paper the random test generation method for large logic circuits is analyzed. Formulas for the detection probability and the number of random input patterns required to complete the test generation with a high probability are obtained for an irredundant fan-out-free combinational network tree consisting of identical n-input NAND gates. The quantitative estimates for the number of random input patterns required for test generation appear to depend upon the number of levels in the circuit and the fan-ins of the gates. Experimental results for actual computer logic circuits are given and show the validity of the approach."
"A heuristic method for generating large-scale integration (LSI) test patterns is described. In particular, this paper presents a technique for generating statistically random sequences to test complex logic circuits. The algorithms used to obtain a set of tests by means of weighted logic signal variations are included. Several techniques for assigning these weights and for varying them are discussed on the basis of the primary algorithm. Also described is a means of obtaining a minimal number of test patterns. This approach has proved successful in obtaining fault-detecting patterns."
"We give new time and processor bounds for the parallel evaluation of linear recurrence systems. Such systems may be represented as x̄ =c̄ + Ax̄ where A is an n X n strictly lower triangular matrix and c is a constant column vector. We show that O og22n) time steps and n3/ 8 + 0O2) processors are sufficient. We also show that mth order linear recurrences, i. e., where A has a bandwidth of m, can be computed within O(log2mlog2n) time steps with at most 3m2n/4 + O(mn) processors. In all cases, our bounds on time and processors are improvements on previous results, and the computer need only perform one type of operation at each time step (SIMD operation). By a simple transformation, the results can also be applied to the solution of any triangular linear system of equations Ax̄ = b̄."
"A central problem in the area of scene analysis is that of segmenting a scene into its natural objects. Current work emphasizes the semantic approach in which a priori knowledge of the shape of an object is used. Yet there is much to learn about more primitive cues for segmentation such as texture, color, and brightness. In the case of human perception, segmentation appears to be due to a multiplicity of cues which operate in a redundant fashion."
"This paper is concerned with the high rate realization of finite-state machines. Two new techniques for high rate realization of finite-state machines are presented, one applicable to finite, the other to infinite memory span machines. It is found that any finite-state machine can be realized by a tree of component machines of a proper size with a given high rate, where the propagation delay of the component machine is less than or equal to the reciprocal of the given high rate. For a given set of logic devices, a synthesis procedure for the component machine with a given propagation delay is proposed."
"Given two nonempty sets of nonempty codewords S = {s1,...,sn} and T = {t1,...,tm}, it is decidable whether there are i1,...,lkand j1,...,jksuch that si1...sik= tj1...tjk, and furthermore, the set of all such solutions is a one counter language."
"An algorithm is developed for generating a single-fault detection test set to be used in a combinational logic network. This algorithm has two unique characteristics. 1) When a test is generated, a list of faults detected by this test is available. Fault simulation, therefore, is not required after the test has been generated. 2) It generates a test set rather than a single test. Each test, with the exception of the first one, is based on a previous test. Repetition of effort and overlapped coverage of faults for different test generations are thus reduced."
"This correspondence discusses the properties of faults in combinational networks and their relationships with fault-detection and fault-location test sets."
"Computation of the k-nearest neighbors generally requires a large number of expensive distance computations. The method of branch and bound is implemented in the present algorithm to facilitate rapid calculation of the k-nearest neighbors, by eliminating the necesssity of calculating many distances. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm. Typically, an average of only 61 distance computations were made to find the nearest neighbor of a test sample among 1000 design samples."
"An algorithm is presented in this correspondence which will generate only those prime implicants (PI's) which are essential or necessary for a minimal sum of products (the technique can be extended for product of sums form also) of a given switching function —iven all the minterms. This algorithm eliminates the neces-sity of finding out all the PI's."
"The authors1have used a coding theory approach in an attempt to design fault-detecting and fault-tolerant asynchronous sequential machines. While the method appears to be sound from theoretical aspects, actual attempts to implement these design procedures reveal a serious shortcoming which should be made known."

"In the above correspondence,1 Ahmed et al. proposed a discrete cosine transform (DCT) and compared its performance with the Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT). They offered empirical evidence showing that the DCT and the KLT compare closely for a number of digital signal processing applications. The purpose of this note is to show that the DCT and the KLT are indeed asymptotically equivalent if the data covariance matrix is a Toeplitz matrix."

"A method for designing the read-only memories (ROM's) needed for multiplication using logarithms is developed. By defining the word length of the multiplicand, multiplier, and product as n bits and the word length of -the rounded logarithms as m bits, design curves are given that allow various values of n and m to be selected for a given multiplier accuracy. Then a table is used to determine, which combination results in an implementation with the least number of bits."
"The design and development of a universal computer in a four-state, five-neighbor cellular model is presented. The underlying structure of the model is an infinite two-dimensional space divided into unit cells each of which can be in one of four states 0, 1, 2, and x. State 0 is the quiescent state, states 1 and 2 are mainly used for signaling, while state x is used for structure purposes. Cells change states at discrete times according to a transition rule which determines the next state of a cell as a function of the present state of the cell itself and its four nondiagonal adjacent neighbors. A configuration is defined to be an assignment of states to all cells in the space such that only a finite number of cells are in the nonquiescent states. A set of configurations, called primitive elements, consisting of the wire, the junction, the corner, the delay, the extendible wire, and the crossover are introduced. Using these elements, a functionally complete set of configurations, called basic organs, comprised of the diode, the OR, the EXCLUSIVE-OR, the clock, and the NOT are developed. The primitive elements and the basic organs are utilized to design four general-purpose components—the encoder, the decoder, the recognizer, and the pulser. These components are used primarily for the detection and the generation of command instructions to and from the universal computer."
"An algorithmic procedure is presented which produces an optimal two-level multiple-output network. In agreement with procedures suggested by other authors, the set of given (incompletely specified) Boolean functions of variables xi is transformed into a single (mosaic) function f( y,x) by using additional variables yi, related to the structure of the resulting network. The agreement ends here, however. It is shown that the function f(y, x) can be composed in such a way that the following statement can be proven as true."
"The notion of level structured operating systems is receiving growing acceptance in the computing community. These systems are implemented and debugged incrementally, one level at a time. Each level provides a pseudo-machine interface upon which the next level can be implemented. Such systems offer significant advantages from the piont of view of debugging, reliability, understandability, and modifiability over conventionally organized systems. The efficiency price which must be paid for this type of organization can be overcome by providing some simple mechanisms in the hardware to support the level structure. It is the purpose of this paper to point out where the hardware support is needed and to suggest one way of implementing these features."
"The problem of detecting faults in arbitrarily large unilateral iterative arrays of combinational cells when any number of modules can be faulty and each module can fail in an arbitrary manner has been considered. A simple design criterion has been given which if incorporated makes the array easily diagnosable. Methods of deriving test sets for the modified arrays, which requires rather trivial computations and no complicated algorithms, have been given. The tests obtained are largely independent of the behavior of the individual modules in the array and are efficient. It has also been shown that Maitra cascades, group cascades, and cutpoint cellular arrays are testable without any modification. Methods of obtaining test sets for these special arrays have been given. Arrays of more than two dimensions have also been considered."
"Some aspects of the application of the mathematical concept of curvature as a practical descriptor of shape for pattern recognition and image processing applications are investigated."
"In this paper, an easily testable machine is defined as one which possesses: 1) a distinguishing sequence of length [log2 n] which forces the machine into a specific state S1, and 2) transfer sequences of length at most [1og2 n] to carry the machine from state S1 to state Si for all i. A design procedure is presented in which an arbitrary machine is augmented to an easily testable machine by adding two special input symbols to the original machine. An efficient procedure is also described for designing checking experiments for the easily testable machines. For an n-state, m-input symbol machine, this procedure gives a bound on the length of the checking experiment that is approximately mn[log2,n]. Furthermore, the total checking experiments are preset."
"Correlation matrix memories are formed iteratively given a single cue-response pair at a time to be stored in an associative anner. If the cues presented are not orthogonal, the memory provides imperfect recollections after a single training exposure; however, if the cues are linearly independent, repetitions of the exposures can lead to ultimate perfect memorization and recollection ability."
"An exact upper bound is found for the number of maximal compatible subsets of an n-state incompletely specified sequential machine (ISSM). This bound, on the order of 3n/3, iS also a worst case computer storage and computation time limit for any algorithm to find maximal compatibles."
"Digital X-Y plotters are peripheral devices of digital computer installations and are used for directly plotting out the results of computations. Digital X-Y plotters normally use an 8-vector algorithm for plotting. This paper describes a superior 16-vector algorithm for digital plotting. The algorithm is based on the fact that, from a given starting point, the recording pen may be driven along any of the sixteen possible elementary vectors. The flow chart for the algorithm is given. It is shown that lines plotted using 16-vector algorithm have no error if their slopes are 0, ±1/2, ±1, ±2, and a. For lines of other slopes, the maximum error is limited to 4 step size. Thus the 16-vector algorithm described is much superior to the 8-vector algorithm. Implementation of this algorithm is also discussed in this correspondence."
"An algorithm is described for generating fuzzy partitions which extremize a fuzzy extension of the k-means squared-error criterion function on finite data sets X. It is shown how this algorithm may be applied to the problem of estimating the parameters (a priori probabilities, means, and covariances) of mixture of multivariate normal densities, given a finite sample X drawn from the mixture. The behavior of the algorithm is compared with that of the ordinary ISODATA clustering process and the maximum likelihood method, for a specific bivariate mixture."
"The algorithm for determining the set of maximum compatibles of Sinha Roy and Sheng is compared with the more recent algorithm of Stoffers. A refinement of the former algorithm is given and a minor mistake in the latter is pointed out."
"In this correspondence uniform decomposition procedures are extended to incompletely specified sequential machines. Any given Moore sequential machine is realized by interconnecting copies of a universal two-state component machine. The information processed by each component machine is represented by its corresponding partial mapping. When the sequential machine is incompletely specified, a reduction in the number of component machine copies is possible. The reduction is found by a uniform-cost search algorithm which finds a minimal cover on the set of partial mappings."

"It is shown that arithmetic operations are simplified if complex numbers are represented in an integrated form with real and imaginary parts sharing the same exponent. In the new representation, numbers with large magnitudes suffer increased rounding errors but errors for some other numbers decrease."
"An analysis of the effects of finite aperture sizes in the scan and display of images is presented. The scanning aperture results in degrading the sample spectrum; the display results in a failure of the Shannon–Whittaker reconstruction theorem. Both effects can be partially corrected for, so as to give an image that is less degraded by scan and display. An example of correction of an actual image is presented as a demonstration."
"A universal logic module of n variables (ULM-n) can be considered as a 2n-in-1 multiplexer (inverse binary tree) whose code is determined by the presentation of external variables. This interpretation permits synthesis of sequential machines. Starting from the state transition map, any sequential machine can be realized by delayed ULM's and OR gates. The decomposition concept of Weiner and Hopcroft is generalized to form a uniform synthesis of n-variable sequential machines."

 "In this paper it is shown how to divide the interval [1,2] into n parts so that the uniform linear approximation of log2x in each subinterval has the same maximum error. This error is, in the case n = 4, smaller by a factor of 2.3 than the error of the linear mean-square approximation given by Hall et al. [1]. The final products of the mathematical analysis are explicit formulas which allow the direct determination of all parameters and the maximum error for any desired number n of subdivisions of [1,2]."
"Computer description languages can be used as input to software tools which aid in the design of digital hardware structures. One of the important phases in the design process is verification. A software system is described which aids the verification process of a computer description at the register transfer language (RTL) leveL. It is based on the concept of concurrent simulation and comparison of the functional and the structural description of a computer. Error types, in particular consistency and semantic errors, and algorithms for their detection are discussed. The tools necessary to implement these detection procedures are outlined."
"There is an increasing use of error detectors and correctors in computer subsystems, such as parity detectors in memory modules and residue checkers in arithmetic units. Their fault tolerant characteristics are studied through the model of detector redundant systems. Their reliabilities and availabilities are analyzed and compared with those which do not have any such error detectors. The design of fault isolating and reconfiguring networks used in the implementation of such systems are developed."
"This paper describes the software and hardware architecture of a system designed as a research tool for experiments on programming the computer controlled assembly of mechanical objects. The software consists of a real-time control level and a background level in which an on-line interpreter permits interactive programming.

The application of the system to sample assemblies is also discussed."
"A hybrid version of the Haar and Walsh-Hadamard transforms (HT and WHT) called Hadamard-Haar transform (HHT),is defined and developed. Efficient algorithms for fast computation of the (HHT), and its inverse are developed.

"This paper presents Markov chain models for analyzing the extent of memory interference in multiprocessor systems with a crosspoint switch for processor-memory communication. Processor behavior is simplified to an ordered sequence of a memory request followed by a certain amount of processing time. The results predicted by the model are compared with some simulation results and some actual measurements on C.mmp, a multiprocessor system being built at Carnegie-Mellon University."
"The problem of clustering N objects into M classes may be viewed as a combinatorial optimization algorithm. In the literature on clustering, iterative hill-climbing techniques are used to find a locally optimum classification. In this paper, we develop a clustering algorithm based on the branch and bound method of combinatorial optimization. This algorithm determines the globally optimum classification and is computationally efficient"
"In this paper we will present two methods for the reronstruction of a two-dimensional picture from its one-dimensional projections at various angles. The first method is recursive, and the second is nonrecursive. Both of these methods have potential applications in picture transmission, and offer valuable insight into the more general problem of reconstruction of three-dimensional objects from their two-dimensional projections. We will illustrate the numerical details of each method by considering the reconstruction of a picture discretized on a 32 X 32 grid, and compare their relative merits. These two methods will also be compared with other methods suggested in the literature."
"A new method for computing the prime implicants of a Boolean function from an arbitrary sum-of-products form is given. It depends on the observation that the prime implicants of a Boolean function can be obtained from the prime implicants of its subfunctions with respect to a fixed but arbitrary variable. The problem of obtaining all irredundant sums from the list of all prime implicants and an arbitrary list of implicants representing the function is solved. The irredundant sums are in one-to-one relation to the prime implicants of a positive Boolean function associated with these lists. The known formulas of Petrick, Ghazala, Tison, Mott, and Chang are obtained as special cases and incompletely specified functions can also be handled. We give a complete and simple method for finding the positive Boolean function mentioned above. The paper is self-contained and examples are included."

"Fuzzy systems are multivalued logic with a continuum of truth values in [ 0,1]. If the truth values inthe interval [ 0,11 are quantized, the operations max (+) and min (*) can be physically realized. Precisely, if [ 0,1] is quantized into 2m equal intervals then the operation max (+) with n arguments can be realized by n rows of one-dimensional unilateral array, each having ( m + 1) cells. The cells in the array are combinational. The min (*) operation is realized by changing the boundary conditions to the array. Fuzzy forms are expressions of fuzzy variables using max (+) and min (*). These fuzzy forms are realized using the max (+) and min (*) gates."

"The subspace method proposed by Watanabe et al. is an important method of feature extraction in pattern recognition. Some new results described here provide a formulation of the subspace method that is particularly easy to implement and overcomes the various numerical difficulties that were inherent in earlier implementations of the method. The present formulation is also important in that it provides the key to the relation of this method to other methods of feature extraction."
"Here the twin problems of feature selection and learning are tackled simultaneously to obtain a unified approach to the problem of pattern recognition in an unsupervised environment. This is achieved by combining a feature selection scheme based on the stochastic learning automata model with an unsupervised learning scheme such as learning with a probabilistic teacher. Test implementation of this scheme using the remotely sensed agricultural data of the Purdue laboratory for agricultural remote sensing (LARS) in a simulated unsupervised mode, has brought out the efficacy of this integrated system of feature selection and learning."

Electrothermic power measurement instrumentation is generally used to measure (below 3 W and above 2 MHz) the average power of an electromagnetic wave propagating in a single mode in waveguide or coaxial transmission lines. The power range can be extended by the use of attenuators or directional couplers, or both.<<ETX>>"

This recommended practice does not define permissible temperature rise or corrections since they must form a part of the standard for the particular apparatus involved. Should contradiction between guidelines stated herein and those in a specific apparatus test procedure or standard exist, the specific apparatus publication will govern.<<ETX>>"

      "The brightness, contrast, and sharpness of the picture on a color television tube screen is of great importance to the consumer and of major interest to the picture tube designer. Chromacolor has yielded a substantial improvement both in brightness (to over 100 ft-L) and in contrast (by absorbing incident ambient light) due to its negative guard-band, black surround construction. The sharpness of the picture on the screen depends largely on the diameter of the electron beam incident upon the phosphor dots. An improvement in sharpness can be brought about by a reduction in the size of the electron beam; however, such a reduction in diameter will result in an increase in current density. This brings up a question concerning the cathodoluminescence1 of these phosphors: is the emission intensity linear with respect to beam current density in the region of practical beam currents?"
"The horizontal deflection yoke current for TV displays tends to be nonlinear and normally requires correction. The correction voltage is required to vary abruptly just before the start of trace and thendecline during approximately the first one-third of trace. In the system discussed in this paper, the linearity correction voltage is superimposed on a capacitor. In order to conserve power, a feedback circuit makes this capacitor charging current flow back into the power source rather than being dissipated."

"This paper provides some insight into the theoretical and practical constraints imposed on the designer of electron guns for color picture tubes."
"The element of Black Art often associated with television horizontal sweep system design may be reduced by resolving the complex system interactions through computer synthesis and analysis. The following procedure derives necessary physical system parameters based on specified desired operating voltages, tertiary tuning, and other physical system requirements. Once acceptable stress conditions have been realized the resultant computer derived design should require only slight \"tweaking\" to yield a workable system."
"The digital computer has firmly established itself as a useful tool in the solution of engineering problems. Perhaps one of the best examples of engineering computer utilization is in the area of statistical analysis of electronic circuits. This paper concerns itself with a particular digital computer program called PANE, (Performance ANalysis of Electrical Circuits) which has been sucessfully used to perform statistical analysis on a variety of electrical circuits [1]. PANE, originally written for the IBM System/360, has been modiffied somewhat to meet the ever increasing requirements of computer-aided circuit design. This means that circuit analysis programs must have the capacity to handle large and complex circuits, and yet do so, particularly in the case of statistical analysis, as economically as possible."
"The performance of electron guns can be improved with the aid of accurate visual models of the gun and beam, including thermal spreading and space charge effects, as previously described in the literature. To effectively model a CRT-type of electron gun, a \"scaled\" approach is outlined in which the region of the cathode and control grid is treated with greater accuracy than are the succeeding regions of the lens and field-free space. Using computer-drawn plots of the gun structure, field, and beam, the five steps needed to imploment this \"scaled\" approach are summarized."
"The colorimetric characteristics of a color television display system are determined by the display primaries, the display white color and the signals applied to the display device. FCC Rules and Regulations state that, for the color television system approved for broadcasting in the United States, the gamma-corrected R,G,B voltages used to form the composite color signal are to be suitable for a color picture tube having primary colors with NTSC chromaticity coordinates. The numerical values of the signal specification assume that the display white color will be CIE Illuminant C. (x = .310, y = .316) Most color picture tubes in use at present (1974) have phosphors whose chromaticity coordinates differ substantially from NTSC primaries. If the signals applied to such picture tubes are those formed by color decoding which is the inverse of NTSC encoding, substantial colorimetric errors will result. These errors can be reduced by a corrective matrix which may be introduced directly or by modifying the color decoding."
"A new integrated circuit, the TDA 1190 is described, capable of carrying out all functions of a TV sound channel, from the video detector to the loud speaker."
"The monolithic integrated circuit described here is part of a kit of devices offered for the complete integration of television receiver functions."
"The General Electric Company has expanded the 2-channel FM stereo broadcast systeml into a discrete 4-channel system2,3,4, that is compatible with present day stereo and monaural receiver equipments. Future receiver systems designed to decode the discrete 4-channel signal must incorporate a low cost decoder which is also functionally compatible with monaural and stereo transmissions. Consideration in the design of the decoder include the format of the composite signal, desired performance levels, technology selection and cost."

   "The introduction of a radically different component in a complex and competitive product such as a color television set is always a somewhat hazardous enterprise. In order to minimize the risk and to gain production and field experience, the decision was made by Zenith to produce a medium quantity of TV receivers equipped with a Surface Wave I.F. Filter (SWIF). This decision is currently being implemented and this paper is an initial report on some of the Engineering aspects of this experiment. Reference is made to a complementary paper,1 in which a detailed account is given of the surface-wave techniques applied in this filter."
"In a Quadraphonic Hi-Fi system it would be highly desirable that the two rear speakers be wireless. The two rear speakers would be completely independent from the main unit and would be composed of a receiving system, power amplifier and speaker. A short range communication system is needed that has full Hi-Fi performance; a bandwidth of 50 to 15 KC signal-to-noise ratio greater than 60 dB and total harmonic distortion of less than 1%. Also, the cost of the system should be as low as possible. There should be no interference between the two rear speakers or with a neighboring system in a nearby room. It would be desirable that the volume level and balance of the whole system could be accomplished at the main unit. This would necessitate that each of the rear speakers also have a remote volume control function. This may be accomplished in two manners. A special control signal may be sent to each of the rear speakers where it will be decoded and set the volume level of that speaker; or, the signal-to-noise ratio of the system can be raised sufficiently high so that the power amplifier can be operated at full volume and during a quiet passage no background noise be heard in a quiet room. A signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 85 dB would be needed."
"Intermodulation distortion generated in a semiconductor diode in series with a resistor is analysed using a Volterra series representation. The equivalent circuit of a diode includes the nonlinear junction conductance, nonlinear junction capacitance, series resistance and series inductance. Nonlinear terms up to and including the fifth order are considered. It is shown that for the VHF range of frequencies the diode capacitance can significantly affect the magnitude and phase of the total distortion at a given product frequency."
"This paper describes the general principles behind the aerodynamic stabilization of flexible video discs as demonstrated by the Thomson-CSF stabilizer, and a modified version investigated by Zenith. It is shown that aerodynamic stabilization is a very nonlinear process and is governed by the stiffness of the air film between the disc and the stabilizer. For the stabilizers under discussion this stiffness is inversely proportional to the cube of the gap between the disc and stabilizer, which necessitates the use of a small gap. Depending on disc thickness and hence on disc stiffness, this gap may be 2-8 mils in excess of the disc thickness. In the modified version the lower CSF stabilizer is replaced by a flight deck. It is shown that the flight deck acts as a prestabilizer which produces a two-to-three fold improvement in stability for the same air gap. Experimental data and computer calculations are organized in a form which provides definite design criteria for the selection of an optimum system."
"Two parallel paths have been followed in the development of power linear ICs. One aspect has been the development of circuit designs and fabrication technologies capable of combining small signal and power output stages on a single chip."
"Two basic new systems are introduced that significantly reduce the chromaticity errors associated with automatic hue control. The first system provides a good balance between performance and price; the second represents near optimum performance. Both systems produce a definite improvement over any of the conventional types of systems that significantly distort the colors, such as green, that are near the Q axis."
"Many IC's have been used widely in television receivers recently.1), 2), 3) All these IC's must have been developed with the aim to improve the performance and to reduce the cost of the television receiver. It seems to be true that by using the IC's, the performance has been increased, but the cost has not been reduced except in rare case."
"A remote controller has definitely become one of the desirable features for TV receivers. Up to 4% of TV receivers sold in Japan are equipped with remote controller. Conventional remote control systems can be classified into the following two systems:"
"Achieving good picture quality in the design of a television receiver is more of a design art than it is a strict technical science. The skills required of an engineer designing a television picture IF amplifier or a video amplifier not only include a thorough knowledge of electronic circuit design principles but also require a feel for the relationships between picture detail (as seen on the tube), electronic systems, and individual circuit components. That 'feel' for the proper amount of pre-shoot in the system's pulse response will dictate whether the picture is crisp or flat. In like manner, excessive over-shoot in the pulse response in either the picture IF or video amplifiers will lead to an ' unnatural' picture. The 'feel' for the proper pulse response as viewed on the picture tube illustrates the use of artistic qualities in television circuit design. This paper does not attempt to define the artistic aspects of television design but rather addresses itself to the problem relating the pulse response of the IF and video amplifiers to the individual circuit components."

       "This paper reports improvements on the CD-4, discrete four-channel stereo system including newly developed integrated circuits. Up to now, the CD-4 systems have been considered to possess several disadvantages in performance compared with conventional two-channel stereo systems. These disadvantages were, for example, unsatisfactory signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), frequency response, distortions and unusual shock noises in the absence of a subcarrier as well as cross-modulation between the main and subchannels."
"Thin, flat-panel direct-view video displays offer the prospect of larger picture size and lower weight and volume, but they will be accepted only if they can compete with the excellent performance and low price of today's shadow-mask CRT. A new and important underpinning in panel development is the growing maturity of IC technology. If such new panels are successfully developed, they could find application in any size from compact portable to extra-large. Large panels will probably be the first to become e-conomically feasible."
"Projection color television has gained the attention of the consumer market during this past year due to the introduction of several low-cost systems into the market place. This paper covers the basic performance factors of these systems: the three-tube Schmidt projector and the color CRT with refractive optics. Future systems which include the light valves and laser TV will be discussed. Typical examples are given."
 "This paper reviews gas-discharge displays for large-screen flat-panel consumer TV. It covers the power and performance requirements for large TV displays, the advantages and dis-advantages of gas-discharge displays for this application, AC and DC devices, modulation techniques and circuit considerations. An attempt is made to describe all of the publicly disclosed work to date on real-time gas-discharge TV displays."
"Although there is considerable interest today in electroluminescent display devices, interest in this subject has varied greatly in the past. As far back as 1937 Destriau carried out experiments on phosphor powders and discovered that luminescence could be produced by the direct application of an electric field.3 Unfortunately his work was either ignored or looked upon with suspicion by the scientific community until 1950 when workers at the Sylvania Co. demonstrated that practical largetrea luminescent panels12 could be made, bsed on Destriau's work. The ensuing few years saw much activity as individuals at various laboratories undertook the study of electrically addressing such panels with the thought of flat-panel TV displays as their ultimate goal. The confidence tnd euphoria initially prevailing soon gave way to widespread pessimism as it became evident that some very difficult problems stood in the way. Aside from the fact that relatively high voltages were required to excite electroluminescent layers, the low average brightness obtained under pulsed or intermittent excitation when sequentially addressing elements seemed discouraging. In addition it was found that the addressing of selected elements by arrays of X-Y conductors caused excessive excitation of other elements, making the contrast of any image impractically low. Equally discouraging was the fact that the operating life of early layers was frequently only a few hundred hours."
"Liquid Crystal, Electrochromic, and Electrophoretic displays are the three examples of low power, passive displays which are described in this review. Their principles of operation are briefly summarized and their properties are compared in six different categories. None of these technologies is suitable for video applications; however, it is quite likely they will be used in digital displays where low power consumption is important and where only a small numbtr of display elements are required."
"Solid state devices and circuits have now achieved a dominant position in most areas of electronics in which vacuum tubes formerly held sway. They have also opened up new areas of electronic applications ( e.g. computers, calculators) not accessible to the vacuum tube. In this triumphant march of solid state technology there is, however, one vacuum tube fortress that has held off all challengers, and seems as impregnable as ever --the TV tube!"

  "A digital function selection system for ultrasonic remote control of TV sets uses pulse counting techniques with the 60 Hz line frequency as the time base. The system achieves superior noise immunity with a unique \"Confidence circuit,\" which uses an adaptive sampling technique to insure that a valid ultrasonic signal is being received. This prevents extraneous random ultrasonic noises present in the environment from causing any function to operate. This technique is superior to other systems in that it processes in-band as well as out of band interference. Upon receiving a valid ultrasonic signal, the I.C. decodes the signal to achieve two way channel control, eight step up-down volume, TV power on/off and mute on/off. A hysteresis circuit on the I.C. reduces the tendency for noise spikes on the 60 Hz line to affect the time base. An option pin enables the system to have either an eight step up-down volume control or a bistable function and four step one way volume control. The I.C. is implemented using p-MOS technology. This paper covers the design of the entire system with special emphasis on the digital integrated circuit."
"This paper describes all details of an ultrasonic remote control system in TV sets developed by ITT Semiconductors in Germany. The system will be introduced in 1975 by 20 TV set manufacturers in Europe. It consists of a CMOS device for battery operated transmitter control, which produces thirty ultrasonic commands and another p-channel MOS-device in Silicon Gate for receiver application."
"The synthesis of a new bipolar technology for the monolithic integration of GHz-transistors and adapted circuit techniques has been achieved. This makes the realisation of integrated circuits for FM front-ends possible."
"Investigation was conducted on the evaluation of various means for obtaining well-tracked bandpass response with emphasis on large-signal handling capability for Varicap VHF TV tuners."
"This paper describes a novel approach to a composite television IF system, integrated onto one silicon chip in a 16-lead DIP. The system performs synchronous video detection and phase detection, and uses a phase-lock loop to synchronize the IF to a locally generated 45.75 MHz reference signal. It includes a video IF amplifier, AGC generators, and a search oscillator which enhances the pull-in range of the phase-lock loop and eliminates the fine tuning in the television receiver."
  "In a color TV receiver employing a conventional shadow mask picture tube, only about a quarter of the emitted electron beams are used to energize the phosphor screen. For this reason, we have often experienced insufficient brightness with a large-screen color TV receiver. Phosphor material has been improved and the super black martix system has been devised to increase the brightness. These means, however, do not necessarily produce satisfying results. And if we want a brighter large-screen TV receiver, we must increase the high-voltage power."
"This paper contains a simple derivation of the fact that for a wide class of ideal vestigial sideband filters and with no distortion in transmission, the in-phase component of the waveform at the input to the detector is the modulating signal itself; the quadrature component is produced by a linear filtering operation on the modulating signal. When the vestigial sideband forming filter has a linear skirt, the impulsive response of this linear filter is h(f) _ sin bsr 2 where b is related to the extent of this skirt. For narrow band modulating signals, the filter described by h(f) is equivalent to a differentiator. Alternate models for the VSB format are proposed. One is chosen in which the quadrature-component-producing filter has an impulsive response which is amenable to computational use. With it, the response of an envelope detector to typical television test waveforms is computed. These results are applied to computing the phase error in the reference used in a quasi-synchronous detector whose input is taken from a conventional IF filter. In an analysis of steady state color error, by evaluating the effect of quadrature distortion using colorimetric coordinates which are subjectively significant, it is shown that the color subcarrier should be attenuated by approximately 7 dB to reduce color shifts in green to imperceptibility in a side-by-side test."
"A new integrated circuit is described which includes all the chroma functions prior to chroma demodulation, and which offers substantial advantages in performance and flexibility. Contained in the 16 pin device are the subcarrier regenerator, automatic chroma control (ACC), dc tint and color level controls, color killer and burst gating. The subcarrier regenerator is a phase-locked loop which provides good noise performance and accurate phase control. The dc controls have well defined characteristics. External adjustment of the color killer is provided for. Interaction between the oscillator and chroma channels can have serious consequences, and has been eliminated by careful circuit design."
"The surface acoustic wave (SAW) technology has existed in many laboratories for a number of years. It has already found a place in many military and professional systems. Perhaps its most successful application to date has been in providing pulse compression filters for chirp radar. Recently, however, SAW bandpass filter design has reached the state where a single device can perform all the filtering necessary in the I.F. stage of colour T.V. receivers. The added advantages of the SAW solution over traditional LC methods are immediately obvious. No manual alignment is necessary. The SAW filter is compact, rugged and reproducible."
"Power consumption is an important design criterion in television receivers today. The Wessel system, which incorporates a parallel switching-mode power supply within the basic trace-driven horizontal deflection circuit, operates over a wide range of line voltage at high efficiency. However, the low-impedance, precision toroid yokes used by some present-day receivers place even greater emphasis upon the efficiency of the Wessel system driver circuit. This paper describes a new driver circuit design which achieves more reliable operation at the required output with one-third (1/3) the power consumption of contemporary designs."
"In certain television applications, such as direct broadcast from satellites or interconnection between microwave links and CATV head ends, the received signal is on an FM carrier, while the ultimate user has a home television receiver which is designed for AM signals. The TV modulation may be transferred from an FM to an AM format and from the input carrier frequency to any desired output carrier frequency by means of a modulation converter consisting of an oscillator, two mixers, and an appropriate filter. This arrangement can be implemented at lower cost than the conventional approach involving demodulation followed by remodulation."

"The. circularly polarized mode of transmission has been proposed for TV. This paper reviews the theoretical aspects and corresponding advantages of circular polarization, such as improved local service, less critical antenna-orientation requirements, ghost-reduction capability, and potential advantages available for co-channel and adjacent-channel interference reduction. Should these features be verified by field tests, the results will be submitted to the FCC for consideration as part of the rule-making process. When the FCC adopts rules for circular polarization an opportunity will exist to improve the quality of television broadcast service to the public."
"This paper establishes the quantitative relation between a TV transmitter load VSWR and the system frequency response. The need for a low value of VSWR is stressed, particularly for multimode transmitting systems."
"Nowadays, news reporting on TV broadcasting requires speed and accuracy. In order to meet these requirements, NHK has developed an entirely new electronic news-gathering system which adopts the merits of both the 16-mm-film system and the television system. This new system consists of a very compact color camera, a portable VTR, a standard playback VTR, and a time-base corrector."

"From the beinning, plate moduladon has been the dominant method of modulation used in commercial amplitude-modulation (AM) broadcast transmitters. Recently, however, alternate modulation schemes have been employed in commercial transmitters in growing numbers, namely, pulse-duration modulation (PDM), modified Doherty, and modified Chireix (Ampliphase). This paper discusses traditional plate modulation and compares it, critically, to the newer methods being employed. Performance parameters and economic factors of each of the systems are reviewed and compared. A tutorial approach is used."
"Most horizontal deflection circuits used in TV cameras or TV receivers are deflection circuits operated by the switching function of transistors. This type of circuit is well known as an efficient deflection system having less power consumption, however, because there is a resistance existing in the deflection coil or within the circuit, it has a defect in that distortion is liable to occur in the deflection current. In order to improve the linearity of this deflection current, various methods were offered in the past, however, nothing definite has been found to solve this problem."

"A phase modulator is described which can directly deviate a crystal-controlled carrier by 1000 rad or more. Frequency multiplication or auxiliwry automatic frequency control (AFC) circuits are therefore not required. The modulator uses an accurate frequency source, a wide-band voltage controlled oscillator, a delay line, and two mixers The achievable phase deviation is proportional to the time-bandwidth (TB) product of the delay line, while the modulation bandwidth is inversely proportional to the time delay. Suitable delay lines are available using either bulk wave or surface acoustic wave transnission. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and distortion are compatible with requirements for broadcast service. Design examples are given for monophonic and stereophonic FM broadcast modulators."
"Theoretical and experimental results are presented of a new color TV camera pickup system using a frequency interleaving method. This system uses not only spatial-frequency encoding techniques, but also color stripe filters inclined to the line scanning direction. Frequency interleaved modulated color signals occupied together in the same frequency bandwidth are obtained as the output signals of the image pickup tube, and are electrically separated by a comb filter."

"The eight papers which follow this one are devoted to processes for extracting from seismic data signals having the maximum signal-to-noise ratio the data permit or to methods of deducing from the processed signals the subsurface responsible for them. In this paper I shall review briefly those characteristics of the signals and of the various types of noise which motivate the several processes."
"It is commonly assumed that a reflected seismic signal consists, at least in part, of a convolution of the earth reflectivity function with a propagating \"wavelet\". The purpose of \"deconvolution\" is to separate the wavelet from the reflectivity function, or to at least change the form of the wavelet to one which is more desirable. This paper describes methods which have been applied or proposed for the deconvolution of seismic signals recorded for geophysical exploration purposes."
"The theme of this essay is simple: what economic equilibrium is in a particular market (structure) depends on what individuals and firms know and how they react in disequilibrium processes to information imperfectly available in that market. Three simplified cases are used to demonstrate this point. The cases technically are shown to be related to the kinds of analyses common in System Theory. From this it is argued that as economists move away from general equilibrium models under certainty with analysis by static equilibrium systems of simultaneous equations, the concepts and methods of systems science will become more important to the economist."
"While it is no doubt appropriate for this panel to discuss a subject as extensive as the role of control and system theory in economics, prudence requires that I pursue a somewhat more modest objective. Consequently I shall confine my remarks to the application of control theory to macroeconomies, and more narrowly yet to short run macroeconomic policy. The subject area remains vast, of course; perhaps too vast to advance any serious generalizations. Notwithstanding I offer the prediction that over the next decade control theory's contribution to macroeconomic policy determination will be more qualitative than quantitative. By this I mean it is unlikely that control theory will be used to generate specific policy directives to guide the economy in the same manner that it generates controls to guide a missile. Instead I believe it will be used primarily to provide insights as to the appropriate policy structure."
"The following definition of Economics is given by P. A. Samuelson: \"Economics is the study of how men and society choose, with or without the use of money, to employ scarce productive resources, which could have alternative uses, to produce various commodities over time and distribute them for consumption, now and in the future, among various people and groups in society.\" Thus the study of economics is related to that of allocating scarce resources for alternative uses. This motivates the use of mathematical optimization techniques in economic problems such as consumer behavior, planning of production and inventory, economic growth, portfolio selections and many other things. The use of control theory seems to be a natural extension when one is interested in investigating the effect of certain changes on the whole motion or behavior over time of the economic system under investigation. When there are random variables or stochastic processes which may be involved in the economic system, the methods of stochastic control would seem to be appropriate. In the study of economics, one important class of problems is that of investigating the effects of a change (sometimes in an unknown way) in some internal parameter on the behavior of the system over time. For such a study, the concepts and methods of adaptive control are extremely valuable."
"It is argued that the interests of control and system theorists can be divided into two sets: the technical interests labeled Control Theory and the \"System\" interests called Cybernetics. It is suggested that unique contributions to economics can only come from Cybernetics."
"In this paper we consider a class of monotone mappings underlying many sequential optimization problems over a finite or infinite horizon which are of interest in applications. This class of problems Includes deterministic and stochastic optimal control problems, minimax control problems, Semi-Markov Decision problems and others. We prove some fixed point properties of the optimal value function and we analyze the convergence properties of a related generalized Dynamic Programming algorithm. We also give a sufficient condition for convergence, which is widely applicable and considerably strengthens known related results."
"We present new necessary conditions for a relaxed minimum in optimal control problems defined by certain classes of ordinary differential equations. These necessary conditions may be helpful in computing singular extremal arcs, in determining when these arcs are \"strictly relaxed\", and in defining regions of the state space that contain nonsingular extremal arcs only."
"A general sufficient condition for global optimality in terms of inequalities between the functions involved in the definition of the problem is developed. This condition is an extension of the sufficient condition obtained by Leitmann and Stalford [6] and can handle problems with constraints on the control and/or the state as well as problems with free final time. Simplified forms are obtained for the particular cases of minimum time and fixed final time problems. Simple examples which illustrate the applicability of the condition to problems with several extremal solutions and/or singular subarcs are also presented."
"Optimal control of singularly perturbed systems with free terminal time is considered. A reduction in system order is achieved by perturbing a small scalar parameter in the system equations. Using the solution of this reduced order problem, an asymptotic series approximation method is presented for obtaining the solution to the complete problem. A backward sweep approach on the reduced model is used in determining the asymptotic series terms. Numerical results on an example show the applicability of the method."
"Error propagation in conjugate direction methods is analyzed. Step size errors at any given iteration are propagated without change. Errors in search direction behave differently. Consider a series of n iterations and assume an error occurs in one search direction, dk. Then, the nth search direction dn, will have k components which deviate from the correct direction dn*."
 "The Riccati equation plays an equally important role in scattering theory as in linear least-squares estimation theory. However, in the scattering literature, a somewhat different framework of treating the Riccati equation has been developed. We show that this framework is very appropriate also for estimation problems, and that it enables us to give simple derivatitions of known results as well as to obtain several new results. Examples include the derivation of backwards equations to solve forwards Riccati equations; an analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the Riccati equation; the derivation of backwards Markovian representations of stochastic processes; and new derivations and new insights into the Chandrasekhar and related Levinson and Cholesky equations."
"A certain \"star-product\" formalism in scattering theory as developed by Redheffer is shown to also be naturally applicable to discrete-time linear least-squares estimation problems. The formalism seems to provide a nice way of handling some of the well-known algebraic complications of the discrete-time case, e.g., the distinctions between time and measurement updates, predicted and filtered estimates, etc. Several other applications of the scattering framework are presented, including doubling formulas for the error covariance, a change of initial conditions formula, equations for a backwards Markov state model, and a new derivation of the Chandrasekhar-type equations for the constant parameter case. The differences between the discrete-time and continuous-time are noted."
"A new approach is proposed for maximum likelihood estimation in linear constant coefficient dynamic systems with general structure. The formulation is developed in terms of the minimum number of variables required to specify the parameter sensitivity of state variables, called the reduced sensitivity functions. An efficient computation procedure is obtained for parameter estimation from time domain or frequency domain data. The importance of end conditions in the frequency domain approach is analyzed."
"The fading memory filter has been proposed as a substitute for the Kalman filter when model errors exist because it discounts old data, thereby, compensating for the influence of model errors. For model errors in the form of completely unknown inputs, this paper presents computational examples for which the asymptotic error of all fading memory filters will be greater than the Kalman error. This contradicts the assumption that, when the Kalman filter is no longer optimal, there exists a fading memory filter which will achieve lower mean squared error. An explanation for this error behavior and a discussion of its implications are included."
"A two dimensional discrete stochastic model for representing images is developed. This representation leads to a \"hybrid\" algorithm for spatial filtering of images. A \"hybrid\" algorithm is one where the filter equations are solved in a transform domain in one direction and in spatial domain in the other. Application of the model to linear filtering of images leads to scalar recursive filtering equations requiring only O(N2log2N) computations for N×N images. Examples on a 255 × 255 image are given."
"In this paper we discuss certain geometrical aspects of linear systems which, even though they arise in the case of single-input/single-output systems, do not seen to have been explicitly recognized and studied before. We show, among other things, that the set of minimal, single-input/single-output, linear systems of degree n, when topologized in the obvious way, consists of n+1 connected components. The Cauchy index (equivalently, the signature of the Hankel matrix) characterizes the components and the geometry of each component is investigated. We also study the effect of various constraints such as asking that the system be stable or minimum phase."
"A representation theory based on convolution operations is developed for a large class of linear systems containing pure and distributed delays in state and control. In terms of this framework a necessary and sufficient condition and a sufficient condition are given for functional (null) controllability. The conditions involve the generation of modules defined over a convolution ring of functions."
"The particular characteristics of the problem of distributing control decisions between man and computer in remotely controlled manipulation are discussed. State of the art is reviewed from two viewpoints: (1) Specifications of both control commands and control context of sensor signals the operator inputs to the manipulator control computer. (2) Operations the manipulator control computer performs on operator commands and realtime sensor signals to control the manipulator for a specified task. JPL breadboard systems, system components, and control experiments are described related to the development and evaluation of manipulator control systems with capabilities of distributing control decisions between man and computer."
"A model of the human arm, emphasizing the neuromuscular mechanism of feedback and control, has been constructed. Reconstruction efforts focused on two parallel aspects of the model: (1) direct control, (2) sensory feedback. The control scheme included a micro computer aided arm prosthesis using myoelectric pattern recognition as the control concept. The feedback elements centered around generation of two perceptual parameters which communicated to the amputee the state of the arm, thereby decreasing his control decision load. The parameters were electrical pulse frequency and spatial location. The developed technology was integrated into a three degree of freedom, self contained, externally energized arm which included elbow flexion/extension, wrist rotation, and hand grasp. A prototype system has been implemented and tested in the laboratory on a mini computer, and specification for a miniature control package has been established."
"A shoulder-disarticulation prosthesis with seven degrees of freedom is formulated as a decision process accepting fuzzy commands from the human nervous system. The problem is decomposed into a functional hierarchy of three levels associated with organization, coordination, and Self-Organizing control, respectively. The highest level transforms a complex command into a sequence of elementary motions. A fuzzy automaton in the middle level coordinates the action of the lowest level controllers which apply direct control inputs to the nonlinear plant."
"The paper describes a system for controlling an artificial upper extremity prosthesis for above elbow amputees in several degrees of freedom. The system employs microprocessor hardware and is based on time series identification of the voluntary myoelectric signals involved and on subsequent limb-function discrimination via the above parameters. The system requires only 1 to 2 electrode sites and satisfies the various practical constraints of weight, volume, and speed as arise in practical prostheses."
"Seismic exploration attempts to recover the acoustic structure of the earth from observations made at the accessible surface. Depositional history often makes a plane-layered model a reasonable first approximation to the structure. Field techniques do not correspond to the use of plane waves, but a method of extracting the equivalent of such observation from data will be discussed. Thus it is of interest to consider the inversion problem for this one-dimensional case. One method for performing such an inversion will be presented, and attendant problems will be discussed."
"In recent years Jon Claerbout and his colleagues at Stanford University have published several articles on numerical studies of approximations to the wave equation. These techniques have been applied to the migration of stacked seismic data, wherein a seismic wave field measured at the earth's surface is extrapolated downward into the subsurface. A simplified description of the method will be given, together with an account of some of the practical computer programming problems and the types of inaccuracies encountered. Routine production results are considered to be comparable or superior to the results derived from alternative migration techniques. Particular advantages are as follows: one, the possibility of using a detailed velocity model of the earth for the migration and two, the preservation of the amplitude and character of the seismic events."
"The problem of pattern recognition is, simply stated, that of assigning a classification to members of a set of objects based on measurements made on the objects. In a typical application problem, the relationship between the various possible classifications of a given object and the measurements is unknown or is very complex. In such instances, we turn to machines to examine the measurements and assist us in making the classification or to help us unravel the complex relationships between the classifications and measurements on a set of objects whose classifications are known a priori. In the context of hydrocarbon exploration, we have tried to answer the question: Is a particular portion of the earth's subsurface in a favorable situation for hydrocarbons to occur? The measurements to be used must be made on geophysical data observable at the surface of the earth. We have restricted the study to the use of only seismic reflection data for measurements."
"Most of the initial benefits derived from simulating seismic exploration over subsurface models were directed toward structural interpretive applications. Current seismic model studies are providing insights which are principally of stratigraphic nature. For example, the resolution inherent in the usual band of seismic frequencies under appropriate conditions was discovered to be at least three times greater than previously conceived. Additionally, quantitative methods for utilizing wavelet processed data are beginning to emerge. Such progress at this early stage of effort suggests more significant results to follow."
"Admitting that there are problems with applying systems engineering to human systems, how can we sharply bound these problems so that they can be studied? The approach here taken is to study the relationship of mathematical languages to other language forms in a philosophical argument. The argument concludes that mathematical systems do not refer to human values, that the ordinary language of citizens and clients can do so only under special circumstances, and that coherent literary language employed in dramatic scenarios is the means of providing the tie between abstract systems and the human values of social life. Thus all three sorts of language must be employed in systems analysis applied to human systems."
 "A feasible method for integrating technological data into a long-run macroeconomic model is proposed. It is argued that this technique reduces the dependence of large-scale decision models on historical data and provides a mechanism for inducing technological change, environmental controls, etc., into a decision model as endogenous variables through a surrogate sample data base."
"A multiobjective framework for the planning and management of a regional water resource system is presented, considering the conflicting objectives of environmental quality and the cost of water resource development. The regional water resource system is a complex, large-scale system and includes a number of proposed and existing water resource facilities (both water supply projects and wastewater treatment plants.) Treatment alternatives available at each wastewater treatment plant include secondary treatment, tertiary treatment, and recycling of treated effluent (at industrial plants only)."
"The purpose of this paper is to formulate an Optimal control problem which is useful for computing management schemes for ecological systems. Three basic constraints on the problem are considered. The optimal control should maximize a performance measure which reflects a maximization of a selected sum of time-weighted averages of state variables with a sufficient penalty on control. The control should be a positive time function corresponding to an input of material to the system. Finally, the control should be T-periodic in order to be compatible with the cyclic behavior of the ecosystem. Conditions are derived which provide for the existence of controls applicable to ecological problems."
"Those optimality conditions in [17] which pertain to the control of Markovian jump processes are presented. These conditions are justified in an intuitive manner. A fairly comprehensive list of references is appended."
"We consider stochastic optimal control problems of Mayer type with dynamics in the form of a system of ordinary differential equations perturbed by a countable state Markov process, and we prove the existence of an optimal control in the class of non-anticipative functions. The proof takes the same approach as the \"direct\" method of the calculus of variations, used extensively in deterministic problems, but substitutes probabilistic concepts where necessary."
"The problem of dynamic file allocation in a computer network is treated in the case when the time-pattern of the file demand rates is not perfectly known in advance to the designer. Instead, only a prior distribution and a statistical behavior are assumed, and the rates have to be estimated on-line from the incoming requests. We show that these estimates are sufficient statistics for the optimal control and obtain the equation giving the control laws as a function of the current estimates and the present location of the file."
 "Often a mathematical model of a dynamical system requires the consideration of uncertain elements. Historically, emphasis has been placed on studying systems in which disturbances enter additively, but many control problems include disturbances that can be more naturally modeled as uncertain (time-varying) multiplicative gains. If the multiplicative gain is of the white noise type, necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of many of these systems have been derived previously. In this article, we develop conditions for the stability of some discrete-time systems containing multiplicative colored noise. Discrete-time systems in which the colored noise is generated nonrecursively are studied. Necessary and sufficient conditions for their mean square stability have been obtained, and numerical solutions are provided for cases in which the colored noise parameter is generated recursively."
"The problem of optimal allocation of pointwise controllers for a class of linear stochastic distributed parameter systems (DPS) is considered. The optimal pointwise control is derived, via a direct approach, while minimizing a quadratic cost functional w.r.t. both control gains and controller positions using gradient techniques."
"The control of a class of stochastic systems with a norm invariant property is considered. The average value of the terminal norm is constrained to be zero. A fixed configuration controller is used to minimize a performance measure which penalizes both excessive control energy and variance of the terminal value of the norm."
"A new notion of computer identification, as opposed to the conventional plant identification problem, is introduced in this paper. It is assumed that it is desired to aynthesize a robust feedforward-feedback controller for an unknown plant so that asymptotic tracking, in the presence of disturbances, occurs. The only assumptions made regarding the description of the plant model are that: (i) the plant is linear and plant-invariant, (ii) the uncontrolled plant is stable. Note that it is assumed that the order of the plant modal is unknown. Necessary and sufficient conditions which allow the robust feed-forward-feedback compensator to be synthesized so that the controlled system is stable and so that asymptotic tracking, in the presence of both measurable and unmeasurable disturbances, occurs are obtained. An algorithm which allows the controllers to be synthesized is given. Some numerical examples are included to illustrate the results."
"Much interest has been generated in the design of multivariable systems. In particular, the system design problem can be transformed into a problem involving a system performance index with algebraic constraints. This paper investigates several approaches to solving the system design problem through application of optimization techniques, once the system performance index and constraint problem has been formulated. The pole placement problem with feedback gain constraints is developed as the motivating example."
"In this paper, the problem of obtaining a pair of relatively prime polynomial matrices from two given polynomial matrices is considered. A method to check relative primeness, in the form of a rank condition on a constant matrix, as well as an algorithm to obtain relatively polynomial matrices is developed."
"We introduce an extension of the usual notion of an input/output map and for linear constant-parameter systems an extended transfer function, that has a (matrix) polynomial- or more generally a differential/difference operator inverse, containing as a submatrix Rosenbrock's system matrix. A new class of system equivalence - \"maximally strict system equivalence\" (m.s.s.e.) is introduced as a necessary and sufficient condition for two minimal systems to have the same transfer function. We give an outline of the extension of these results to non-minimal systems, where results are only known for state-space systems in this generality. In the conclusion we discuss the relation of the extended system matrix to other deterministic and stochastic problems."
"In the first part of the paper, a characterization is given for the class of all closed loop eigenvector sets which can be obtained with a given set of distinct closed loop eigenvalues using state feedback. It is shown, furthermore, that the freedom one has in addition to specifying the closed loop eigenvalues is precisely this: to choose one set of closed loop eigenvectors from this class. Included in the proof of this result is an algorithm for computing the matrix of feedback gains which gives the chosen closed loop eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The last few sections of the paper present a method of utilizing the freedom to choose closed loop eigenvectors to improve the transient response characteristics of a coupled setpoint control system without altering its eigenvalues."
"A necessary condition for obtaining stable solutions to the minimal design problem is presented. The condition is shown to be sufficient for insuring the stability of solutions which need not be minimal. The results are based on the recently developed notion of minimal bases of rational vector spaces, and an example is employed to illustrate and clarify the procedure."
"The purpose of this paper is to summarize results obtained for the adaptive control of the F-8C aircraft using the so-called MMAC method. The discussion includes the selection of the performance criteria for both the lateral and the longitudinal dynamics, the design of the Kalman filters for different flight conditions, the \"identification\" aspects of the design using hypothesis testing ideas, and the performance of the closed loop adaptive system."
"This paper will describe an adaptive control system for aircraft that is based on a parameter identification on-line scheme. The adaptive mechanism uses two elements: one, a digital batch processing of a data record to obtain identified parameters; and, two, algebraic relations specifying the control law constants given the identified parameters. Concerning the first, a data record representing a time history of the most recent state measurements serves as the input to a computational algorithm for the identifier. It has a finite length and, hence, as new measurements are taken, old ones are pushed out of the data batch. The computational algorithm used to identify the parameters is a modified Newton-Raphson scheme. It uses a linearized model to represent vehicle motions. The model is obtained from continuous-time representations of the aircraft dynamics. The continuous-time representation is converted to a discrete form necessary for the model using a first-order Euler integration scheme. The model contains 10 parameters which are to be identified. Three parameters relate to the longitudinal motions of the vehicle and the remaining ones relate to the vehicle's lateral motions. The longitudinal and lateral model parameters affect only longitudinal and lateral model variables, respectively. This permits identification of longitudinal or lateral parameters as subsets when the data record does not contain adequate information for complete identification of all subsets of the model parameter space. Parameter subsets are altered only after a successful test of the rank of the information matrix related to that subset. The second element involves taking the parameter estimates and adjusting control law constants. That operation should be performed only after the process is converged to proper estimates of the parameters. Hence, another test (related to smallness of the model fit error over the data batch) is made to insure that the parameter estimates are meaningful. The design criterion for control law adjustments, given the parameters, is based on maintaining uniform linear response characteristics. Results of tests of the overall system will be presented. The tests are made on a fixed base, six-degree-of-freedom, piloted simulation of the F8-DFBW aircraft. The simulation is resident on the CDC 6600 real-time computer facility at Langley Research Center. The control system is resident on a computing system external to the 6600 facility, an EAI Pacer digital computer system. Control is scheduled using real-time interrupts; but, the processing of the adaptive mechanism is treated as a background job for the system. Records indicating performance of the identifier over a large range of flight conditions will be presented. Results will be presented for different data batch sizes (number of points) and densities (spacing in time between points)."
"This paper presents design and performance details for a set of adaptive flight control laws to be flight-tested in NASA's F-8 digital fly-by-wire research aircraft. These control laws implement an explicit maximum likelihood identification algorithm to estimate key aircraft parameters. The parameter estimates are then used to compute gains in a quadraticoptimal command augmentation control law."
"Simple mechanical linkages have not solved the many control problems associated with high performance aircraft maneuvering throughout a wide flight envelope. One procedure for retaining uniform handling qualities over such an envelope is to implement a digital adaptive controller. Towards such an implementation an explicit adaptive controller which makes direct use of online parameter identification, has been developed and applied to both linearized and nonlinear equations of motion for a typical fighter aircraft. This controller is composed of an online weighted least squares parameter identifier, a Kalman state filter, and a model following control law designed using single stage performance indices. Simulation experiments with realistic measurement noise indicate that the proposed adaptive system has the potential for on-board implementation."
"A system for on-line detection and identification of aircraft sensor and effector failures is developed. The heart of the system is a state estimator which provides accurate, real time estimates of the aircraft states. These estimates are used both to provide failure analysis and as inputs to the flight control system. Because the sensors measure functions of the aircraft state, the state estimator also provides running estimates of what it believes each sensor output ought to be, based upon the previous history of sensor outputs and commanded control inputs. Because of the relatively large number of sensors, of various types, that are available; there is an abundance of observability. Thus, failure of a single sensor will not greatly degrade the state estimates and in the event of a sensor failure the output of the failed sensor will diverge from the estimated value. The divergence is monitored and decision logic, based upon likelihood ratio tests, is employed for sensor failure detection and identification (FDI). The likelihood ratio methods provide a systematic, quantitative means for design of the decision logic. This FDI technique is in direct contrast to techniques which employ voting among like sensors and therefore require three sensors of every type in order to identify the single failure of any one of them. The present technique, employing likelihood ratio methods, requires fewer sensors because of its utilization of the redundant information available from sensors of different types which are coupled through the dynamics of the aircraft."
 "Two targets of measured, constant reflectivity in the area of San Francisco, California are studied. The first standard, a waste (carbon black) treatment pond at an oil refinery near Suisan Bay, having an area of approximately 0.3 square miles, (or 215 pixels), and bandpass reflectances of <0.5% in all four bands, is assumed to have a zero contribution to the radiance recorded by ERTS. The radiance observed then arises entirely from atmospheric scattering. The variation in these radiance values as a function of solar zenith angle has been analyzed. A second target, a concrete parking apron for aircraft at Moffett Field, California, assuming that it remains dry during the period of study has constant reflectances of 27.8, 31.0, 30.0, and 32.3 percent bandpass reflectances in four MSS equivalent channels. Using these values, the radiance observed by ERTS may be corrected for the atmospheric contribution, and thus values for the radiance from the target may be calculated. These values were studied as a function of solar zenith angle."
"A computerized system for processing ERTS images for geologic applications is described. The basic philosophy of the system is to generate the highest possible quality images and to apply simple enhancement techniques optimizing images for direct human interpretation. Automated mapping, classification and analysis techniques are avoided for several reasons. First, several types of noise are present: system noise generated by the camera system, data transmission and data processing and \"noise\" inherent to the natural scene-cultural effects, vegetation masks and clouds and water. Second, the geologic environment itself is extremely complex. Automated interpretive techniques usually merge such noise undecipherably into the image. A major part of the processing described here is devoted to the removal of \"noise\" patterns, atmospheric effects, variable illumination, geometric corrections, and correction for high frequency loss. The enhancement stage is the one tailored for the specific application and scale; utilizes relatively simple algorithms; and consumes a lesser portion of the processing time. It has been found, further, that the image processing technology is ideal for handling other kinds of mappable data, such as gravity and magnetics, in which extremely large (107 - 109 bits) data sets can be treated displayed and analyzed as images. Examples include shaded relief models of \"surfaces\" representing geophysical data, color composites of multivariate data to examine several types as well as their intercorrelations in a single image, and the use of false stereo in which any data set (e.g., gravity) can be merged as a stereo component of the image of any other data set. The basic goal is the evoluation of techniques for the presentation of immense multivariate maps or data sets directly to the human brain, by far the most sophisticated data interpreter."
"A review of the design of an interactive digital image processing system is presented. Reasons for interactive image analysis are given and the functional requirements of a system are determined from image processing problems and by considering the techniques applied by a human photointerpreter. Design considerations and the implementation of an interactive image processing system on a general purpose computer are described. Several examples demonstrating the application of interactive digital image processing are given."
"Six types of computer-processed remote sensing products are discussed which are intended to highlight differences in chemical or mineral composition of exposed rocks, minerals and soils. Examples of three of these (ironoxide ratio image, calibrated color composite of three ratios, and automatic recognition maps) are given in this presentation for a LANDSAT frame of the Wind River Basin, Wyoming. Mineral exploration can be improved by including iron oxide mapping as a reconnaissance tool for mapping hydrothermally altered areas in igneous terrain and exposed portions of geochemical cells in poroussandstones. Both metal and hydrocarbon exploration can be aided by stratigraphic mapping with automatic recognition maps, which can sometimes disclose \"hidden\" structures and can map some compositional differences among members and facies with in a single formation."
"Against a background of an I.T.C. proposal for an \"Agricultural Real Time Imaging Satellite System\", (ARTISS), some ideas about matching Man and Machine effort are given. Typical features of satellite MSS are reviewed. Many features other then pixel-wise Multi Spectral signatures should also be used in a classification process. Man is well equiped to use those extra features, but needs Machine help for efficient working. The aim of the ARTISS proposal is to provide developing countries with a dynamic survey system at reasonable cost. The author's ideas about the equipment for a minimum local groundstation are exposed. Implemention should use \"intermediate technology\", compatible with more advanced extensions in hard-and software."
"The problem is the gap: the gap between theory and practice, the gap between the academic world and the \"real world\", the gap between the ideal and the expedient. The gap is not unique to the field of automatic control. It has been identified in other branches of electrical engineering and in other engineering disciplines. Even in the field of endeavor as far removed from ours as medicine there is the gap: the disdain of the medical research for his clinical colleagues is legendary; so is the researcher's lack of bedside manner."
 "One has a distinct feeling that control theory is approaching a stalemate in the sense that one no longer sees contributions in the literature, which represent large strides. Rather, one has the feeling that the field is jogging in place. This state of affairs can be attributed to two factors. (i) There has been a great deal of very capable work over the last decade, that has thoroughly investigated the \"canonical\" questions raised in the fifties and early sixties. To the extent that some of these questions could be answered, they were answered, and those that remain open are largely intractable. (ii) We appear to be locked into a set of \"canonical\" problems and there has been little, if any attempt to raise new ones. A symptomatic area in this respect is pole placement. There has been a great deal of effort devoted to the canonical question of minimal compensators needed for arbitrary pole placement, and hardly any progress has been attempted on the unspoken next question which is that of how these pole placement results should be utilized in feed-back control system synthesis. In fact, it seems certain that the interesting results of the future should deal with synthesis. It is an area of great and largely unexplored possibilities. Among these: (i) techniques for interactive, computer aided: design; (ii) design techniques based on the use of trade off characteristics; (iii) the use of minicomputers in variable structure sampled data feedback systems; (iv) extensive use of optimization algorithms in the design of nonlinear feedback systems, partly as a tool for coping with nonlinearities and partly (simultaneously) with constraints in the time and frequency domains; (v) the specification of new types of control systems based on different performance expectations from those in current use. In short, it only seems that we are in a stalemate. By moving on to a new wave of exciting and meaningful research activity in the control area."
 "The purpose of this paper is to present certain key references that survey developments and trends in the area of decentralized estimation and control methods."
"The systemwide generation allocation problem is defined and its customary subdivisions, geographical, hierarchical, modal and functional are identified. Functional areas of control action are noted and the control practices within these areas and especially on the interfaces are observed and discussed. The necessity, progress and potential direction of a rethinking of the interfaces and their control is discussed."
"Secure power system operation is obtained, to a large extent, by on-line monitoring of the system assessing its security, and providing control action to improve its security level. Traditionally, the economy of system operation was the overriding factor. By combining economy with security, the problem becomes quite complex from the points of view of: (a) Methodology of security assessment (b) Overall objectives of system optimization, and (c) Computational feasibility for on-line analysis. In this paper, an overview of the application of optimization theory to this problem is examined. A critical analysis of a selected subset of methodologies is provided."
"A survey of the criteria of stability used in the power system transient stability problem is made. The status of progress in the use of these methods is given, and the areas of difficulty are outlined."
"An estimation-detection scheme is proposed for the estimation of signals with unknown parameters. The scheme is illustrated by considering the case of a signal with unknown but bounded variance. Two sets of bounds are used to determine two regions of signal uncertainty, and different linear estimators are used for each region. A detector is then used to select the appropriate estimator. Since no a priori information is assumed on the unknown parameters a weighted minimax criterion is used to optimize the detector and the estimators."
"This paper develops maximum likelihood (ML) estimation procedures for the parameters of a generalized Gamma probability density function. In addition, the likelihood ratio conditioned on the ML estimates of the process parameters is given. A special case arising in the analysis of carbon monoxide pollution data is discussed in detail and the performance of the binary hypothesis test functioning as a pollution forecasting algorithm is reported."
"This paper presents an alternative method in dealing with non-linear estimation problems. The principle is to approximate the integration of the conditional density functions by using Gaussian Qudrature Formulae and set up the grid for the current filtering density simultaneously. The grid is centered at the filtering mean. The size of the region where the grid locates is changed according to the conditional distribution. A method for choosing the number of nodes and the integration interval to minimize the integration error is given. For the case that the system noises and measurement noises are white gaussian and the measurement function is linearizable, the accuracy of the representation of the filtering density can be theoretically controlled by a priori choice of the number of nodes and the truncation factor."
"In this paper we describe a fresh approach to the discrete linear filtering problem. Our method involves an upper triangular factorization of the filter error covariance matrix, i.e. P = UDUT. Efficient and stable measurement updating recursions are developed for the unit upper triangular factor, U, and the diagonal factor, D. This paper treats only the parameter estimation problem; effects of mapping, inclusion of process noise and other aspects of filtering are treated in separate publications. The algorithm is surprisingly simple and, except for the fact that square roots are not involved, can be likened to square root filtering. Indeed, like the square root filter our algorithm guarantees nonnegativity of the computed covariance matrix. As in the case of the Kalman filter, our algorithm is well suited for use in real time. Attributes of our factorization update include: efficient one point at a time processing that requires little more computation than does the optimal but numerically unstable conventional Kalman measurement update algorithm; stability that compares with the square root filter and the variable dimension flexibility that is enjoyed by the square root information filter. These properties are the subject of this paper."
"The filtering algorithm for processing integral measurements given in reference [1] is extended to include analog type prefilters with infinite memory, and to include sequential processing of prefiltered data in multi-sensor, multi-sample rate systems. The extension to infinite memory prefilters requires serial decorrelation of the prefilter output prior to state estimation. These algorithms provide a technique for investigation of prefilter parameter sensitivities, and provide optimal compensation for any information loss due to prefiltering."
"The Rapid Estimation Scheme (RES) for estimation of states subject to unknown inputs has been described in Refs. 1 and 2. Kalman filter (KF) was observed to be divergent in some computer simulations when the states changed suddenly due to unknown inputs. This paper derives sufficient conditions for the convergence of KF after the occurrence of unknown inputs and also determines the conditions on the signal to noise ratio for the effectiveness of either KF or RES."
"Both differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) and adaptive predictive coding (APC) systems have been used somewhat successfully for low data rate digital voice transmission. A DPCM system has as its goal the removal of signal redundancy prior to transmission by a linear prediction of the incoming signal with a weighted combination of past signal estimates. The error in the prediction process is then quantized and transmitted to the receiver. An identical prediction loop is used at the receiver to reinsert the redundancy, and hence, to reconstruct the speech signal. Both the quantizer and predictor may or may not be adaptive."
"A method is proposed for estimating the norm of a system having a random damping term. Apart from the damping, the systems of interest would be norm invariant. Hence the estimation scheme is really a way of monitoring the damping. The estimator is a first order linear filter, and the results are suboptimal."
 "A long standing approach to nonlinear system theory is the use of Volterra series to represent Input/output behavior. Techniques have been developed for determining the terms in the series from differential equation descriptions and from Input/output experiments. However the generality of this representation in a sense ignores structural features of the system under consideration, and this often precludes mathematical tractibility."
"Bilinear delay-differential systems appear frequently in applications. We present here controllability properties of such systems and in particular we derive criteria for local accessibility, and a \"bang-bang\" theorem."
"This paper presents some explicit results on solution, stability, and transformation of a fairly broad class of linear time-varying systems. It is shown that for this special class of linear time-varying systems, the solution can be represented as a product of two matrix exponential functions and the system stability can be determined directly from eigenvalues of two constant matrices. Furthermore the system can be reduced to a linear time-invariant system by successive applications of an algebraic transformation and a t↔τ transformation. The generalized results given here contain several previously reported results as special Cases."
"The optimal control problem for distributed parameter systems with control applications to the coefficient matrices is formulated. A procedure for solving this problem and the necessary conditions for optimal coefficient controls resulting from the variational technique are given. The optimal coefficient distributed and boundary controls are characterized by the solution of a two-point boundary value problem."
 "It is well known [2, 3] that the nth order Lyapunov equation, AP+PA'=-Q, can be expanded to a n(n+1)/2 order linear vector equation and then solved using conventional linear equation methods. The purpose of this short paper is to present recent work on the sparceness of the resulting equation and the computational advantage of that sparceness, for large n."
"Sufficient conditions for the L∞ - and l∞ - boundedness of nonlinear interconnected systems are established. Systems which may be viewed as an interconnection of single-loop feedback systems are considered. Overall boundedness conditions are phrased iu terms of the margins by which each subsystem satisfies a certain boundedness condition. The existence of similar results for the L∞ - and l∞ - continuity of nonlinear interconnected systems is noted."
"The automatic classification of vectorcardiograms and electrocardiograms into disease classes using computerized pattern recognition techniques has been a much studied problem. To date, however, no system exists which meets desired accuracy and noise immunity requirements and development of new techniques continues. An important aspect of the problem is that of feature selection, in which the functions of data reduction and information preservation are performed. In this paper, the problem of linear feature extraction is studied and a modified form of the Karhunen-Loeve expansion is developed which appears to have some advantages for the present application. Comparison with other feature selection methods is made using a two-dimensional example. Finally, some areas for future research are pointed out."
"Diganostic radiology is a branch of clinical medicine in which various forms of radiation are employed as an aid in the diagnosis of potential pathologies in a relatively noninvasive fashion. Both radioactive and x-ray sources of radiation are commonly employed as are a wide variety of detector and equipment configurations. Our objective in this presentation is to survey some signal processing problems that arise in this context, particularly problems in which random point processes and statistical inference seem to be of some importance."
"A brief functional description of the manner in which the immune system seems to control disease and infection is presented. Recent hypotheses in immunology and the role of a model to support this work are discussed. This leads to the derivation of a simple model for the generation of antibodies from clonal selection theory. A survey of related research is provided along with model assumptions and shortcomings. Model innovations are suggested to explain the more intense secondary response to a repeated invasion by a particular alien as well as the immunoglobulin switch-over phenomenon. A case is established for more complex models which include two major classes of lymphocytes (white blood cells) termed T cells and B cells, their functional subclasses, their interaction, immune tolerance and cell mediated immunity. While plausible arguments are presented for further model development, it is noted that immunology, as supported by on-going experimental research, is such a rapidly changing science that a final model is hardly imminent. Plans are outlined for continued model development in sequence with new experimental evidence. It is seen that stochastic control and adaptive structures play a significant role in the immune processes."
"This study uses the techniques of optimal control to model the cat during the take-off phase of a maximal vertical jump. A set of kinematic and neuromuscular measurements are compared with the results of the mathematical model, to suggest additional experiments and to enhance the physiologist's understanding of normal movement."
 "Analysis and interpretation of multi-spectral images from aircraft and space platforms is finally advancing out of the empirical stage and is attaining a solid quantitative foundation. This logical evolution is made possible by wider acceptance and use of digital Image-processing techniques and a better understanding of the in situ spectral-reflectance characteristics of earth materials."
"An experimental program to develop an integrated remote sensing-geochemical petroleum exploration technique has been established by the U.S. Geological Survey. Briefly, the concept is based on previous and ongoing research within the U.S. Geological Survey which demonstrates that imperfect rock seals capping petroleum and natural gas deposits may permit large volumes of low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons to escape to the surface, with one or more of the following results: (1) the slowly seeping hydrocarbons chemically and biochemically oxidize; (2) liberated CO2 is incorporated into carbonates, forming pore-filling cements invested with unique isotopic signatures; (3) gas, expansive under depressurization, evaporates near-surface pore water, likewise precipitating isotopically distinctive pore cements; (4) the highly reducing hydrocarbons and associated compounds cause discoloration of surface strata by reduction and dissolution of iron. All these late diagenetic alteration phenomena reflect the subsurface distribution of petroleum. The BIRDDOG program in part attempts to explore for these kinds of surface anomalies using the following integrated approach."
"Two experiments were conducted by the U. S. Geological Survey using LANDSAT-1 multi-spectral scanner (HSS) data to identify ground features that are indicators of sulfidebearing rock; a nearby known sulfide deposit was used as a \"training area\" (control). The first experiment used visual examination of false-color composites to locate possibly favorable areas; the second employed classification by digital computer processing."
"Thermal channel data collected with the Skylab S192 multispectral scanner was evaluated for a scene collected over the Death Valley, California area during January 1974. The data collection features of the scanner and the preprocessing of computer compatible precision data products are described. The thermal scene is evaluated for surface feature discrimination using three techniques: 1) false color image construction based on data statistics, 2) image density slicing based on a frequency histogram, and 3) quantitative and qualitative single-channel classification of predominant features in the scene. Procedures and results are discussed and sample test materials are presented. The results indicate that relative temperature values in small adjacent areas have potential importance in feature discrimination. The temperatures of nonadjacent features over a large scene have less immediate value due to the adiabatic effects of altitude and the effects of differential solar heating."
"An accelerometer can be constructed using a radioactive proof mass the position of which can be determined on the basis of the difference between the mean number of emitted charged particles detected at opposite walls when the proof mass is not centered. If the emission rate is relatively small, however, the mean counting rate is very noisy; satisfactory operation requires optimum signal processing. The control system, designed by linear stochastic control theory, generates forces that tend to keep the proof mass centered between walls of the instrument and simultaneously produces on estimated acceleration output. The Poisson-type noise of the pickoff is approximated by Gaussian noise; the acceleration input is modeled as a random walk. It is found by simulation that for an instrument with 1.0 inch spacing between the walls, the proof mass excursion can be confined to a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.36 inch in a severe acceleration environment. The accelerometer output tracks a constant input without error and, when the input acceleration has a random component, the rms error is of the order of ten percent of the random component."
"Multiple-target tracking in high target density situations can be posed as a multi-hypothesis decision problem. The complete solution of such problems on a real time basis requires that the computations be carried out in a computer-efficient manner. This paper discusses a formulation of the tracking problem based on 0-1 integer programming which can markedly reduce Computer time requirements."
"This paper discusses the application of an eigenvalue sensitivity method1 to a linear, time-invariant, model of the High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (HTGR) manufactured by General Atomic. It is shown that for this type of system with distinct eigenvalues, a relation can be obtained between the solutions to the classical sansitivity equation and the eigenvalue and eigenvector sensitivities. This relation indicates that the eigenvalue and eigenvector sensitivities are more fundamental indicators of parametric effects than the solutions of the sensitivity equation. A FORTRAN program (SENSIT) was developed to implement the algorithms required for eigenvalue sensitivity calculations. This program was applied to a large scale (58 state) linear time invariant model of the HTGR operating under closed loop control."
"This paper deals with the comparison of two adaptive methods based upon sensitivity equations for use in the surveillance and diagnosis of an experimental nuclear reactor. The surveillance and diagnosis are obtained by a real-time comparison of reference parameters and the actual parameters given by the adaptive algorithm. The first algorithm uses an on-line, steepest descent method. Results obtained with this algorithm using experimental data from a reactor are given using two different criteria. The second algorithm uses both sensitivity equations and a recursive least squares method. An example is given using the experimental model of the same reactor. Both algorithms described in this paper are easily implementable on a mini computer and are not sensitive to a priori knowledge of the statistical properties of the noise. These algorithms are also suitable for the surveillance of nonlinear processes."
 "The autopilot design discussed here is based on the algebraic inversion of the system equations A natural manifold for this procedure is proposed and discussed."
"Optimal control laws are obtained for the elevator and the ailerons for a modern fighter aircraft in a rolling pullout maneuver. The problem is solved for three flight conditions using the conjugate gradient method."
"The techniques of Process Parameter Estimation are applied to the problem of reducing motion-induced noise in vector magnetic field sensors intended for submarine communications in the Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) band. Methods using both least squares fitting and steepest descent techniques are developed and shown by means of a computer simulation to reduce motion noise to a value less than the sensor noise level."
"A linear system with two sets of controls, one primary and the other redundant, is considered. A two level optimization procedure is used to control the system and to maintain maximal availability of the primary control."
"The purpose of this paper is to discuss, in an informal manner, some of the very interesting problems that arise when one examines decision strategies in dynamic communication networks. The study of such systems leads to natural decentralized control strategies associated with stochastic control problems with nonclassical information structure. Since this nonclassical information pattern is a consequence of the physical limitations on the speed of information transfer, we call this class of problems relativistic stochastic control problems."
"This is an elementary survey of recent work analyzing the stability of interconnected systems. The points of view used to organize the survey are: computational complexity, methods of analysis, the implication of the analysis for model simplication, and applicability to power systems. A fairly comprehensive bibliography is appended. Some suggestions for research are given."
"Asymptotic and aggregation methods are discussed as tools for separation of time scales in large dynamic systems."
"A general description of the decentralized control problem, with particular emphasis on large scale systems, is made. In this problem, constraints on the structure of the information flow between the manipulated inputs of the system and measured outputs of the system are imposed. Typically, it is desired to find a controller for this system (subject to the above constraints), so that stability of the resultant closed loop system is obtained, and so that regulation/tracking of the outputs of the system occurs, independent of any input disturbances occurring in the system. A motivation for dealing with the decentralized problem is made, classical ways of solving the problem are described, and recent results obtained on the problem are surveyed. Some numerical examples are included, in particular, a power system consisting of three interconnected synchronous machines; it is shown in this power system that there is no real advantage is using a (more complex) centralized control system over the conventional (and more simple) decentralized control system which is normally applied."
"The problem of optimal regulation for stochastic linear systems with adjustable plant parameters is examined and posed as a nonlinear programming problem. A computational procedure, built around the Generalized Reduced Gradient algorithm, is developed to solve the associated plant-controller design problem. The procedure is illustrated via a lateral autopilot design in which the quality of regulation is improved by approximately 18% over that achievable with a nominal fixed plant."
"Exclusive concern with mean utility has often masked the intrinsically probabilistic nature of the performance of an optimally controlled stochastic system. For a class of linear jump parameter systems, a design algorithm is presented for evaluating the stationary probability distribution of the utility function for the optimal closed loop system."
"This paper addresses the time propagation of triangular covariance factors. Attention is focused on the square-root free factorization, P = UDUT, where U is unit upper triangular and D is diagonal. An efficient and reliable algorithm for U-D propagation is derived which employs Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. Partitioning the state vector to distinguish bias and colored process noise parameters increases mapping efficiency. Cost comparisons of the U-D, Schmidt square-root covariance and conventional covariance propagation methods are made using weighted arithmetic operation counts. The U-D time update is shown to be less costly than the Schmidt method; and, except in unusual circumstances, it is within 20% of the cost of conventional propagation."
"We consider optimal control problems in which the state evolves as a semi-markovian process and the control acts only at some random times with instantaneous costs at these times. Dynamic programming optimality conditions take the form of differential inequalities which can be solved numerically."
"A problem of guaranteed error control is formulated (in a minimax sense) for a norm uncertain system. We eliminate the usual Frechet dlfferentiability requirement on the system error norm. Consequently, the classical differential theory (for stationary points etc.) is not applicable. Nevertheless, the solution may be characterized in this case by using *e, the envelope correspondence."
"This paper discusses the control of nonlinear stochastic systems and, in particular, linear systems with unknown parameters. The stochastic nature of the problem leads to the probing and caution properties of the control. Explicit expressions of the probing and caution terms in a stochastic control problem are presented. These terms are obtained by a closed-loop approximation of the stochastic dynamic programming equation. An approximate value of information can be evaluated and the benefit to be derived from probing (experimentation)can be traded off against its cost. The interplay between caution and probing is discussed."
"A decision-theoretic formulation is given for the problem of classifying an unknown nonlinear stochastic system into one of M classes when only input-output measurements are available. This leads directly to a pattern recognition solution for the problem, and Bayes-risk theory yields the likelihood-ratio test for class determinations. Parameterizations which yield an implicit description for unknown nonlinear systems are considered, and the theoretical likelihood ratio is related to these parameterizations. The difficult problem of initial feature selection is considered in terms of a parameter vector, and in terms of a quasi-moment expansion, both of which require no a priori knowledge of the system. Experimental results are also cited which show that classification can be accomplished with a low probability of error, and analogies with other classification problems are noted."
"Most of the present-day literature concerned with identification theory and techniques is directed toward lumped parameter systems, and many comprehensive surveys of the field are available, (see Refs. 1 and 2) for example(s)). Relatively little has appeared in the literature concerning distributed identification, and even more noticeable is the scarcity of papers dealing with systems described by the one-dimensional wave equation. Perdeauville and Goodson (Ref. 3) were perhaps the first researchers with a workable but time consuming method for the identification of coefficients of the wave equation. Fairman and Shen (Raf. 4) also considering the wave equation, used the technique of finite differencing to approximate spatial derivatives, and Poisson filter chains to approximate temporal derivatives."
"Recently major advances have been made in the analysis and estimation of parameters of stochastic compartmental models. The theory of illness-death processes as given by Chiang (1) provides a basis for the analysis of this important class of stochastic models. Motivated by the need for stochastic pharmocokinetic models, we have derived results which enable us to identify the parameters of m compartment models using time series data from one to r compartments. Following Matis and Hartley (2) we have derived explicit expressions for the elements of the covariance matrix for the case of observations from r compartments. We then incorporate the covariance matrix in a generalized least squares estimation of the parameters from time-series data. The parameters identification procedure, which uses a modified Gauss-Newton technique to minimize the generalized sum of squares, yields estimates of the values of the flow rates between compartments and standard deviations for these parameters."
"Let X be a measurement space and f(x) a real function defined on it. If f(x) takes only a small set of discrete values then we have the standard classification problem. Otherwise f (x) can be considered as defining a fuzzy pattern recognition problem. We consider the problem of dividing X into regions xi( = 1,2 .... R) such that on each one of them f(x) is approximated either by a constant or a linear function. The partition is generated for a given R by minimizing the total integral square error. This problem is equivalent to piecewise functional approximation. After the regions Xi. and the approximations have been determined than it is possible to predict the value f(x) for any given measurement x. The computational requirements of this approach are higher than those of the common learning algorithms but it is applicable in cases where (except for extreme cases) class membership is vaguely defined as it is often the case in socio-economic problems, mechanical and medical diagnosis etc."
"Various recent identifiability results for feedback systems are discussed and compared. It is shown that the use of a white noise perturbation input leads to robust methods, in that they require a minimum amount of information about the structure of the system. Such a method, using a combined stochastic approximation and covariance factorization algorithm, is briefly presented."
"This paper points out a relationship between identifiability and input selection for multiparameter systems. Two examples are given to illustrate this relationship."
"This paper treats one aspect of the identification of state-derivative-coupled systems, such as Mx(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)+ w(t) where M ≠ I and M is invertible. This equation can also be written as x(t) = F1x(t) + F2u(t) + w(t). We assume that reduced form parameters (F1,F2) are identifiable and develop a sequence of tests for establishing the identifiability of structural parameters (M, A, B) from (F1,F2). The tests are constructive, in that they can not only be used to ascertain the identifiability of (M, A, B); but, if (M, A, B) are not identifiable, can also indicate corrective actions to be taken so that (M, A, B) are identifiable."
"By applying a maximum likelihood approach to identification with empirical data from a tracking task, the output signal uncorrelated with the input signal (a definition of human operator remnant) can be determined. To obtain this remnant signal, a linear, stationary model describing the human is utilized. The innovations signal, is computed from the difference in the empirical data and the model's output. The remnant can then be identified using the innovations sequence by computing the component of the output signal which is uncorrelated (or orthogonal) to the input signal. Data from a Roll Axis Tracking Simulator is analyzed and remnant is identified to two phases of tracking (with and without motion information)."
 "In this abstract, we outline an analysis of the control structures required for the movement of an animal or a robot. As we shall see, artificial intelligence studies have tended to focus on the high-level planning of various stages involved in an activity, while control theory has had more to say about the regulation of posture and simple limb movements."
"Based on operational experience with initial computer control procedures, more sophisticated procedures have been developed designed to provide a greater variety of services simultaneously and to allow the operator more discretion in the quality of service provided. This paper describes these second generation control procedures and analyses their effectiveness in the light of previous operational experience and in a simulation context."
 "Fourth generation computers allow for a great deal of exploitation by the railroad industry. Capabilities exist for the computer to take on a role of virtually operating the railroad and executing a new philosophy of operation which addresses and emphasizes service reliability and car utilization. Management relationships and roles must change also; but in today's climate of impending financial collapse there is a new way out of the car utilization dilemma."
"The growing labor intensiveness of the air traffic control system, and concerns over the safety of aircraft operations, are focusing increased attention on the possibilities of increasing the level of automation. Advances in computer technology and communication techniques offer the potential for significant improvements in the operation of the traffic control system. This paper reviews the functions of air traffic control and, based on detailed studies of these functions, outlines an approach which has the potential of achieving a significantly higher level of automation with resulting improvement in safety and operating efficiency."
"The objective of the paper is to present a description of the various control functions necessary for the operation of advanced automated transit systems. These control functions are hierarchical in nature and range from scheduling and routing to control of velocity and spacing between individual vehicles. Proposed solutions to the various control problems which arise in advanced automated transit systems are discussed."
"The man in the pipeline control room (the dispatcher) is responsible for the minute by minute management of the pipeline system. He must keep the hydraulics in balance and deliver the correct product at the right time and in the right quantity at the right place. He is required to do this by operating the pipeline in its most efficient dynamic form. Small computers have made it possible to present more information to aid the dispatcher in decision making, Illustrations from many pipeline operating companies show how this new equipment is being used to speed human reaction."
"This paper reviews some of the recent developments and applications of simulation methods for use in nuclear production scheduling and fuel management. A more detailed summary of the state of the art is contained in an Engineering Foundation Conference paper (1). Emphasis in this paper is placed on the various formulations and approaches to the mid-range planning problem, whose objective is the determination of an optimal (least cost) system operating strategy over a multi-year planning horizon. The decomposition of the mid-range problem into power system simulation, reactor core simulation and nuclear fuel management optimization, and system integration models is discussed."
"Two processes are termed strongly (respectively weakly) feedback free when the canonical innovations representation (IR) of the joint process has one of two specified structures respectively [1-4]. The property that two processes are feed-back free captures the notion of a unique direction of influence between two processes. A set of equivalent characterizations of this property is presented in this paper. These characterizations yield a set of statistical tests for feed-back. When feedback exists between two processes it is possible to identify the separate loops of the IR by prediction error methods [5-9]. However, it is only when the disturbances in each loop are mutually orthogonal, and one of the loops contains a delay, that the loops so identified constitute the feedforward and feedback loops of the observed physical system. In this paper we describe how closed loop identification problems arise in load and generating source identification in power systems. We present some initial simulation results obtained by applying a spectral factorization algorithm to the problem of closed loop system identification. Further, we describe the application of this algorithm to real power system data [18-20]."
"The use of digital computers for power system protection and control has been studied for the past decade. However, economic considerations, reliability problems, and system constraints have prohibited the actual use of computers in substation protection schemes. Recent advances in microcomputer technology have provided power system protection engineers with a new tool. A distributed microcomputer protection scheme is introduced and compared to present substation protection techniques. Speed, reliability, and operating advantages as well as the adaptive control possibilities of the proposed system are pursued."
"There has been a very rapid increase in the size of power systems, and it is still growing. This growth has made the present day systems very big and complex. The complexity is arising especially due to many Interconnections, different types of loads and larger generating units. Also there is uncertainty in load forecasting. With EHV interconnections the disturbances are felt even in geographically distant parts of the system, increasing the severity of the disturbances. These factors make the satisfactory operating of the system a more difficult task. Added to this, Society is becoming more dependent on electric power; and it is essential to make the power available to customers without any interruption and within certain limits of voltage and frequency variations. This means that there is a great need to ensure that a system is as economical, reliable and secure as possible [1]. High reliability of the system is usually obtained by following the principles of bulk power supply planning. However, due to delay in commissioning of new plants and equipment, equipment outages, unexpected load demands and disturbances, the system may be forced to operate in or close to critical and emergency conditions. Hence, in addition to sophisticated planning and designing of the system, an effective operation and control of power systems is essential. The maintenance of a system in a reliable and secure mode is becoming an Important part of the Job of the operators. In the past, more emphasis was given to economic operation; but in view of the consequences of power failures, reliable and secure operation of the system is being given more importance. Security assessment deals with the tracking of the system and deciding whether the present state is secure or not. If the system's state is found to be insecure, it forewarns the operator to take possible remedial action or to be ready for the disturbance if it takes place. This is done before any disturbance (which may lead to failure or deterioration in the quality of supply) occurS. Thus security evaluation is essentially an on-line procedure. The paper will discuss the different operating states of a power system, system security and different approaches for transient security assessment. Recent research results applying the pattern recognition approach will be summarized and presented."
"Multistage stochastic programming with recourse is formulated in terms of a recursive sequence of mathematical programming problems--P0,..., PK--with stochastic data. A polyhedral property of their feasible regions is used to derive a Lipschitz property of their objective functions. A slightly stronger property is used to conclude that any measurable decision rule satisfying the explicit and Implicit constraints of Pk(0 ≤ k ≤ K) almost surely can be redefined on a set of measure 0 so it satisfies the constraints for every possible realization of the random variables. Sufficient conditions for each of the two polyhedral convexity properties are given."
"The multistage or staircase structure appears naturally in many models with time horizons. This paper presents and discusses a decomposition algorithm when the problem functions are convex. The Dantzig-Wolfe convex programming algorithm is presented as one of the techniques available for solving the generated subproblems. Computational implementation of the algorithm and more efficient techniques in the presence of special structure are discussed."
"This paper presents a new procedure for determining, from the state equations, the factored matrix form of the transfer matrix of a linear time-invariant system given in state variable form. The procedure is conceptually straightforward and demonstrates a connection between the desired representation and the representation of a lower order imbedded subsystem. Applying the basic procedure recursively leads to a computational algorithm for determining the desired representation. The algorithm differs from those presented previously in that explicit computation of a controllabillty or observability matrix is not required."
"On this paper we give several derivative-free algorithms for unconstrained optimization of a function of several variables. The algorithms are based on modifying some quasi-Newton methods by accepting a finite difference approximation to the gradient vector. They all proved to be locally and Q-superlinearly convergent."
"This paper considers the problem of exact minimum energy control of linear systems with linear functional constraints on the output. An explicit correspondence is established between constrained minimum energy control and interpolation with ARMA (autoregressive-moving average) splines, and then used to obtain a formula for the optimal control. The control-spline correspondence is an input-output duality: if the system is driven by the optimal control, the output will be the appropriate spline."
"An algorithm for finding the set of all Pareto-optimal solutions of a linear multiple-objective optimization problem is presented in this paper. This algorithm is successful in detecting any Pareto-optimal solution and will systematically and efficiently determine the entire set of Pareto-optimal solutions. An example is given to illustrate the algorithm."
 "For an apparently simple 2-stage linear-quadratic zero-sum difference game with dynamic information structure, we show that (i) there exist nonlinear saddle-point strategies which require the same existence conditions as the well-known linear closed-loop no-memory solution, (ii) there exist both linear and nonlinear saddle-point strategies which require more stringent conditions than the unique open-loop solution. We then discuss the implication of this result on the existence of saddle-points in zero-sum differential games for different information patterns."
"The problem of controlling a linear dynamic system by two competitive controllers having different quadratic performance indexes is formulated and investigated, Majorant control and minorant control programs are proposed."
"The problem of reducing the terminal state sensitivity to small variations in plant parameters for a class of zero-sum two-player linear differential games with a fixed target was examined by implementing the optimal strategies in a combined open-loop and closed-loop form. A direct search computational procedure was adapted for selection of two feedback matrices used in the strategies, if the elements in the matrices are restricted to have constant values. A specific example of a linear fixed-target pursuit-evasion game was illustrated. It was noted that not only the terminal state sensitivities can be effectively reduced to zero but the state sensitivities at all times until termination of the game are also greatly reduced."
"The pursuit-evasion problem of two aircraft in a horizontal plane is modelled as a zerosum differential game with capture time as payoff. The aircraft are modelled as point masses with thrust and bank angle controls. The games of kind and degree for this differential game are solved."
"A class of finite - state, finite - memory stochastic control problems is considered. A minimum principle is derived. Signaling strategies are defined and related to the necessary conditions of the minimun principle. Min - H algorithms for the problem are described."
"The performance of Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) decision methods for dynamic system identification is investigated. By examining a finite set of a posteriori probabilities a decision is made as to which of several possible regions of the parameter space the true parameter value lies. It is shown that for the true parameter value in a prescribed region the corresponding a posteriori probability converges exponentially (mean square) to 1. The analysis is based on the asymptotic per sample formula for the Kullback information function, which is derived in this paper. We believe that the properties of Bayesian MAP decision methods discussed in this paper make them useful for application in dynamic system identification in conjunction with standard techniques such as the maximum likelihood (ML) method."
"In this paper, the fundamental nature of the \"partitioned\" algorithms is demonstrated by showing that the \"partitioned\" algorithms serve as the basis of a unifying approach to linear filtering and smoothing. Specifically, generalized \"partitioned\" filtering and smoothing algorithms are given in terms of forward and backward-time differentiations that are theoretically interesting, possibly computationally attractive, as well as provide a unification of the previous major approaches to filtering and smoothing and clear delineation of their inter-relationships. In particular, the generalized \"partitioned\" filtering algorithms are shown to contain as special cases both the Kalman-Bucy filter as well as the Chandrasekhar algorithms. Furthermore, the generalized \"partitioned\" algorithms lead to important generalizations of the Chandrasekhar algorithms [5-7, 18- 19], as well as of the previous \"partitioned\" algorithms of the author [15-19]. These generalizations pertain to arbitrary initial conditions and time-varying models. It is also shown [20-22] that the generalized \"partitioned\" algorithm may also be given in terms of an imbedded generalized Chandrasekhar algorithm with the consequent possible computational advantages. Similarly, the generalized \"partitioned\" smoothing algorithm is shown to contain as special cases the major algorithms for smoothing such as those of Mayne and Fraser [9-10], Kailath and Frost [12], and Meditch [11], as well as the related ones of Zachrisson [13], and Biswas and Mahalanobis [14]. Finally, backwards smoothing algorithms for arbitrary boundary conditions are also obtained as a special case of the \"partitioned\" smoothing algorithms."
"In a radically new approach to linear estimation, Lainiotis [9-11] obtained fundamentally new discrete filtering and smoothing algorithms in a \"partitioned\" or decomposed form. The partitioned algorithms were shown to have several theoretically interesting and computationally attractive properties. In this paper, a companion to part I on continuous models [13], the fundamental nature of the partitioned algorithms is demonstrated by showing that the discrete partitioned algorithms serve as the basis of a unifying approach to discrete linear filtering and smoothing. Specifically, generalized discrete partitioned algorithms are presented that are theoretically interesting, computationally attractive, and all encompassing. The all encompassing nature of the generalized partitioned algorithms is demonstrated by showing that they contain as special cases all previous major filtering and smoothing algorithms. More importantly, they yield important generalizations, of past well-known algorithms, as well as whole families of such algorithms."
"For a linear stochastic, system minimizing the expected value of an exponential function of a quadratic yields a control law for the terminal guidance problem which operates linearly on the estimated states. The control gains are explicit functions of the error variance in estimating the state. It is shown that the control gains can be calculated by combining a precalculated matrix determined by a backward integration in time with the error variance calculated forward in time. If the measurement variance is estimated in real time, then the error variance must also be calculated in real time. The control scheme will then be adaptive reflecting the estimated quality of the information. The adaptive control scheme is applied to the terminal phase of a homing missile where the measurement variance is estimated on-line."
"This paper is concerned with the parameter adaptive least squares estimation of random processes. The main result is a general representation theorem for the conditional expectation of a random variable on a product probability space. Using this theorem along with the general likelihood ratio expression, the least squares estimate of the process is found in terms of the parameter conditioned estimates. The stochastic differential for the a posteriori probability and the stochastic differential equation for the a posteriori density are found by using simple stochastic calculus on the representations obtained. The results are specialized to the case when the parameter has a discrete distribution. The results can be used to construct an implementable recursive estimator for certain types of nonlinear filtering problems. This is illustrated by some simple examples."
"This paper deals with the dynamic stochastic control of a freeway corridor system, which consists of a multilane freeway interconnected with entry and exit ramps to one or more parallel traffic arterials, and subject to ramp controls and signals at intersections. Key issues associated with the use of modern estimation and control theory are presented."
 "The detection of accidents and other capacity reducing incidents, e.g., occurrences of disabled vehicles in traveled lanes, on urban freeways is an important aspect of freeway traffic management. This function has been automated in several existing freeway surveillance and control systems in the form of incident detection algorithms. Multiple feature incident detection algorithms use two or more functions of traffic data and associated thresholds to signal the occurrence of incidents. These algorithms are constructed to distinguish patterns of traffic conditions distinctive of incidents. In this paper, a general approach to the calibration and evaluation of multiple-feature algorithms which are structured as decision trees is described. This methodology is applied to the California algorithm."
 "Computer model SCOT (Simulation of COrridor Traffic) is a traffic engineering tool which simulates traffic flow through an urban freeway corridor network. It contains equations which describe the way vehicles are driven on freeways and streets and takes into consideration the field site geometry, traffic demand and control system. In this study, the capabilities of the model to simulate ramp control and to route traffic through the network along time minimal paths were investigated. Numerical values for standard traffic performance measures showed the improvement to freeway traffic flow caused by ramp metering as well as the resulting ramp congestion. The computed optimal traffic assignment showed that significant changes in the distribution of traffic could occur if drivers were given timely information."
"This paper investigates and extends the Surrogate Worth Tradeoff (SWT) Method of Haimes and Hall [1974] for the solution of multiple objective problems. The general multiobjective problem is reviewed. The geometric interpretation of the worth functions Wij and the interrelationships among the various Wij as well as the tradeoff rates of the ith and Jth objectives, λij are studied; a modification of the definition of the worth functions guarantees their applicability to a wider class of problems. Theoretical bases for the methodologies discussed are established. Two algorithms which utilize different approaches for implementing the SWT method are described, and the problem of allocation of stream resources is solved as a multiple objective problem by the SWT method. Computational results are presented and analyzed."
"An open loop feedback control strategy is developed for the control of a semi-markov population. Census forecasts of the population are derived. Assuming the existence of a cost associated to the census, an optimal control problem is formulated. A suboptimal control is obtained by solving at each period a mathematical programming problem. Evaluation of the proposed strategy is made for use as hospital admission system."
"The stability of two third-order population ecosystems is analyzed and system dependence on intrinsic rates of growth is demonstrated. A bounded, quasi-optimum feedback control law is derived to satisfy a quadratic cost function. The stabilizing effect of the law is studied both mathematically and via digital simulation."
"Effective enforcement of no-parking regulations, an essential operation in urban areas, is labor intensive and thus costly. Efficient, implementable enforcement strategies that can raise and keep compliance at a desired high level are needed. It is the objective of this work to determine such strategies. First a model relating enforcement (input) to compliance (output) was obtained on the basis of experimental data; its form is that of a homogeneous bilinear Markov process. Then several optimization problems that reflect different operating conditions were formulated and the corresponding enforcement strategies were derived. Finally, simulations were used to analyze the practical implications of the results."
"The growth path of a mixed, open urban economy is considered which is linked to the national economy through labor flows in the direction of higher per capita consumption. In its private sector, profit maximizing firms produce output, hiring individually labor but using jointly infrastructure with public good characteristics. The public sector divides via taxation output into consumption and infrastructural investments so as to maximize the current value of future per capita felicity. Urban growth paths are derived and public sector policies regarding labor migration and provision of infrastructure are analyzed."
"All project managers strive for cost and schedule realism. The Department of the Army has established a novel concept called the \"Total Risk Assessing Cost Estimate (TRACE)\" to develop a new program cost-estimation procedure for research, development, test and evaluation cost realism. Such a procedure properly accommodates program uncertainties/ risks inherent to specific work elements, and the high-risk work elements are budgeted accordingly. The purpose of this paper is to propose such a procedure which subscribes to a risk analysis approach and satisfies the essential elements of the TRACE concept. The procedure consists of two models: a cost impact model and a schedule variance model. Applications of the procedure to the NASA/Army Tilt Rotor Research Aircraft Project are also presented for illustration."
"Numerical results in this paper indicate that an efficient transition to a more costly energy resource could have a significant impact on macroeconomic variables."
"Generalized partitioned solutions of Riccati equations are presented in terms of forward and backward-time differentiations that are theoretically interesting, computationally attractive, as well as they provide important new interpretations of these results. This approach leads also to important generalizations of previous Riccati solutions such as the Chandrasekhar and the partitioned algorithms. Specifically, it is shown that the generalized partitioned solutions may be given in terms of a generalized Chandrasekhar algorithm. These generalizations pertain to arbitrary initial conditions and time-varying models. Furthermore, based on these partitioned solutions, robust and fast algorithms are obtained for the effective numerical solution of Riccati equations. A particularly effective doubling algorithm is also given for calculating the steady-state solution of time-invariant Riccati equations. The partitioned algorithms are given exactly in terms of a set of elemental solutions which are both simple as well as completely decoupled, and as such computable in either a parallel or serial processing mode. Moreover, the overall solution is given by a simple recursive operation on the elemental solutions."
"In this paper, the geometric relationship between the optimal solutions to the sampled-data and continuous linear quadratic regulator problems is investigated in a Hilbert space framework. It is shown that the optimal sampled-data solution, excluding the response due to the initial condition, is the projection of the optimal continuous solution onto the set of all solutions that satisfy the sampled-data constraint. That is, the optimal sampled-data solution is an optimal approximation to the continuous solution. In fact, it is shown that the sampled-data solution can be obtained by solving a sampled-data tracking problem with the continuous solution as the desired trajectory."
"A digital computer program (ORACLS) for implementing the optimal regulator theory approach to the design of controllers for linear time-invariant systems is described. The user-oriented program employs the latest numerical techniques and is applicable to both the digital and continuous control problems."
"We describe several interconnections between the topics mentioned in the title. In particular, we show how some previously known formulas for inverting Toeplitz operators in both discrete- and continuous-time can be interpreted as versions of the Christoffel-Darboux formula for the biorthogonal Szegö and Krein polynomials on the circle and the line, respectively. The discrete-time inversion result is often known as Trench's formula, while the continuous-time result was apparently first deduced (in radiative transfer theory) by Sobolev. The concept of innovations is used to motivate the definitions of the Szegö and especially the Krein orthogonal functionals, and connections to work on the fitting of autoregressive models and inversion of the associated covariance matrices are also noted."
"It is known that the minimum fuel control problem is equivalent to a minimum l1 norm problem with linear equality constraints. By applying the dual space theory of linear vector spaces, the minimum l1 norm can be found by maximizing a linear functional with a l𝓁 norm constraint. This maximization enables the application of a linear programming technique which is usually very efficient. The control sequence which achieves the minimum fuel cost is then found by applying the alignment property in the dual space."
"Generalized Chandrasekhar algorithms are obtained that are applicable to time-varying models as well as time-invariant ones. Backward and forward-time differentiations are introduced that readily provide the generalized Chandrasekhar algorithms as well as several interesting interpretations of these results."
"A method for estimating the parameters of a linear system by analyzing the impulse response of the system is presented. The impulse response is obtained by perturbing the unknown system with a pseudo-random discrete interval binary signal and using crosscorrelation techniques. Criteria for selecting parameters in the impulse response analysis and for the pseudo-random signals are presented."
"This paper considers the parameter identification problem of general discrete-time, nonlinear, multiple-input/multiple-output dynamic systems with Gaussian-white distributed measurement errors. Knowledge of the system parameterization is assumed to be known. Regions of constrained maximum likelihood (CML) parameter identifiability are established. A computation procedure employing interval arithmetic is proposed for finding explicit regions of parameter identifiability for the case of linear systems. It is shown that if the vector of true parameters is locally CML identifiable, then with probability one, the vector of true parameters is a unique maximal point of the maximum likelihood function in the region of parameter identifiability and the CML estimation sequence will converge to the true parameters."
"Motivated by the complexity and the large quantity of on-line operations required for nonlinear filtering problems, observers for nonlinear stochastic systems are constructed based on a Liapunov-like method. Sufficient conditions on the structure of a nonlinear stochastic system for the existence of an exponentially bounded observer are given. These conditions can be applied off-line. The stabilization of unstable nonlinear stochastic systems using observer feedback are investigated. Sufficient conditions to stabilize cascaded control and observer in a feedback arrangement are given."
"The problem of control of a linear stochastic system observed by both linear and hard limited measurements is considered. The control used is the LQG or deterministic linear feedback control where the state estimate is generated by a recursive nonlinear filter. It is shown that the feedback nature of the control induces a natural probing which activates the filter. The results of this feedback system with a nonlinear filter in the feedback loop is compated to a system with an extended Kalman filter in the feedback loop. The state estimation accuracy is also compared to the system without a control to demonstrate how the control activates the nonlinear filter."
"The analog adaptive filters, nonlinear in general, which are considered here have been proposed in connection with the problem of identifying an unknown system with a particular linear structure from measurements of its input and output. We show first that under ideal conditions, and provided the input signal satisfies a nondegeneracy (\"mixing\") condition then the norm of the vector of differences between the actual and the estimated coefficients converges exponentially to zero. Both upper and lower bounds on the rate of convergence are derived and both bounds exhibit an identical and rather unexpected dependence on the gain of the filters' control loop. These results are subsequently used to bound the behavior of the filter for various perturbations from the ideal situation as when noise is present, the unknown system is time varying and the analog integrators have finite memory."
"In the model of this paper the state of the system follows a linear auto-regressive process and is observed with noise. The decision-maker's problem is to estimate the current state: with a payoff function quadratic in the decision variables the optimal estimator is the conditional mean, given the observations. With the use of the Kalman filter results of interest to economists are obtained. The basic result is that the optimal estimate is a convex linear combination of the current observation and the previous optimal estimate. This is a generalization of the 'adaptive expectations' formula widely used in economics."
"Filtering problems arising in quantum electronics are investigated. In particular the minimum variance linear filtering problem incorporating quantum mechanical measurements is solved for both scalar and vector signal processes. The simplification of the filter under certain assumptions is demonstrated. Examples from optical communication systems illustrate the results."
"This paper presents a result on computing the generic rank of a structured matrix and applies it to the problem of structural controllability first studied by Lin. The main result is a simple algorithm for the determination of structural controllability of multi-input linear systems."
"The relation of eigenvalue location properties of weakly coupled systems and systems with slow and fast modes in singular perturbation analysis is considered. A \"weak interconnection\" condition that does not require a set of eigenvalues to be smaller in modulus than another set is introduced. Stability, controllability, sensitivity and optimality are discussed."
"The decentralized robust control of a completely general servomechanism problem is considered in this paper. Necessary and sufficient conditions, together with a characterization of all decentralized robust controllers which enables asymptotic tracking to occur, independent of disturbances in the plant and perturbations in the plant parameters and gains of the system, is obtained. A new type of compensator called a decentralized servo-compensator which is quite distinct from an observer is introduced. It is shown that this compensator, which corresponds to an integral controller in classical control theory, must be used in any decentralized servomechanism problem to assure that the controlled system is stablizable and achieves robust control; in particular, it is shown that a decentralized robust controller of a general servomechanism problem consists of two devices (i) a decentralized servo-compensator and (ii) a decentralized stabilizing compensator. It is then shown that, under certain mild conditions, there almost always is a solution to the robust decentralized servomechanism problem for any composite system consisting of a number of subsystems interconnected in any arbitrary manner. This last observation has important implications for process control."
"A design procedure for minimal-order observers for linear, observable, time-invariant systems is developed based on certain polynomial matrices associated with the transfer functions of the plant. The approach is to select the observer dynamics so that the feedback control law is satisfied with a minimal-order system. The method is a frequency domain technique but is significantly different from earlier results. Necessary and sufficient conditions for construction of a minimal-order observer to observe several linear functions of the state are given."
"A synthesis procedure for dynamic compensators based on a differential operator representation is developed. The compensators satisfy the algebraic separation, principle and may qualify as 'control observers'. As such they show the same properties as a state observer in a control loop. However, this compensator approach is more general, in that it immediately allows zero placement to be taken into account. For single-input, multi-output systems, a simple and unified procedure, for the construction of minimal order compensators with and without arbitrary pole placement is established. This procedure then is generalized in a straightforward way to the construction of low order compensators for multi-input systems. The approach is particularly advantageous if a higher order (dynamic) state feedback control law is given. In this case, a total compensator of minimal order can be constructed."
"A completely general algebraic method for converting a set of linear differential equations that describe a multivariable system to the standard state equation model is considered. The entire procedure is developed in a straight forward manner so that each aspect of the algorithm is simplistic in nature as well as efficient when implemented on a digital computer. An example is presented to illustrate all phases of the method. A PL/I program has been developed by the authors for use on the IBM 360 computer."
"The augmented error signal concept, recently introduced, can be useful in designing model reference adaptive systems for plants with inputs which are subject to hard saturation. Liapunov's Direct Method is used as the basis for these designs. Figure 1 shows the configuration for the types of systems considered. The adaptive control acts to null the augmented error, and, in the process, also assures that the true error between plant and model approaches zero."
"The formulation of a class of parameter adaptive control problems, including plant parameter identification, is developed for deterministic linear systems which leads to a positive definite performance index J(θ) with the properties: (i) J(θ) and its derivatives can be computed at the end of each observation time interval using only input-output data, i.e., no state estimation is employed, (ii) a minimal value J(θ*), computed by the use of any suitable gradient Type algorithm, is known to be optimal provided J(θ*) = 0 and some other nondegeneracy conditions involving the input-output data are upheld, (iii) unknown disturbance inputs can be incorporated."
"Some characteristics of model reference adaptive control systems are described with a special attention to the learning aspects in adaptation. Learning aspects in adaptation does not necessarily require an explicit identification scheme as demanded in most of the published research literature."
"An on-line, adaptive decoupling scheme is proposed in which the performance criterion is a coupling measure based on on-llne input-output correlation analysis. A procedure for constructing a minimum norm feedback gain for decoupling control is described. The approach leads to an efficient fine-tuning algorithm which preserves decoupling in the presence of sufficiently small (or slow) parameter variations."
"This paper reports results obtained in an evaluation study of model-tracking parameter identification for the optimally controlled CH-47 helicopter while in flight. The model is made to track some of the helicopter parameters by means of Liapunov-designed adaptive algorithm. The topics investigated include the accuracy of identification of the time-varying vehicle and the effect of controller feedback upon the performance of the identifier."
"This paper presents a stable implicit adaptation algorithm for model reference control. The constraints for stability are found using Lyapunov's second method and do not depend on perfect model following between the system and the reference model. Methods are proposed for satisfying these constraints without estimating the parameters on which the constraints depend."
"The problem of pole positioning is considered when the parameters of linear, time invariant systems are unknown. A specific parameter adaptive philosophy is proposed and conditions for convergence of the paramerer identifier are presented. A stable and unstable open-loop model are then implemented with the above adaptive scheme to assess its performance characteristics."
"Digital enhancement of satellite data from NASA's Land Satellite (LANDSAT) is providing new information useful to a variety of natural resources investigations, including mineral and hydrocarbon exploration. Experience has revealed that digital processing of the satellite's computer compatible tapes is the only feasible and efficient method for extracting the maximum amount of valuable geological information contained in them. This study provided an opportunity to critically evaluate the application of enhanced data in extracting additional geological information from test sites in Central Colorado and northwestern Canada, which are areas of significant metallic mineralization and hydrocarbon potential, respectively."
"The earlier work [7, 8] on the joint adaptive plant and measurement control problem has been restricted to stochastic systems with time-invariant (constant) unknown parameters. This paper extends the results to stochastic systems with time-varying unknown parameters. It is shown that the plant and measurement control calculations can be separated which simplifies the implementation of the scheme."
"Geophysical tools used in the direct detection of hydrocarbons include the study of time, velocity and the amplitude anomalies. Static and dynamic corrections are generally understood to be the corrections applied to the arrival times of reflections in the normal course of seismic data processing. However the validity of velocity analyses and the resulting processed seismic sections largely depend on the accuracy of static time or linear phase shifts computed to remove near surface time anomalies. Similarly the validity of amplitude anomalies present on the seismic section will depend on the proper removal of the near surface effects. This paper presents a technique for computation of surface consistent amplitude and phase corrections. Several examples using both marine and land data are presented to illustrate the techniques."
"General linear-quadratic singular variational problems with free end-point are examined. Procedures are given for establishing whether a prescribed problem has a solution, and for computing the optimal performance index and optimal controls when these exist."

 "A technical description of the EOLE location and data collection system with 480 constant level balloons released in the Southern Hemisphere is presented : the EOLE satellite contacts successively each platform, acquires and stores range and range rate data allowing computation of the location of each transponder and meteorological data measured by the plat form sensors. This information is stored on board and then read out by telemetry upon reception of a command from ground stations. The experiment itself is described and the main technical results are analyzed ; the ultimate location accuracy of the EOLE System was found to be of the order of 300 meters for fixed platforms but, some difficulties concerning the Location of drifting balloons were encountered due to the necessity of compensating the Doppler shift for platform motion. The main scientific results are briefly presented as well as some post-EOLE experiments. Future developments of this type of location and data collection system are described as a conclusion."
"In 1974, the Random Access Measurement System (RAMS) will be launched aboard the NIMBUS F satellite as part of the Tropical Wind, Energy Conversion, and Reference Level Experiment (TWERLE). This paper describes operation and performance of the RAMS instrument, which will provide a means of tracking and collecting data from a large number of instrumented platforms. In operation, the RAMS will perform satellite onboard processing of up to eight simultaneous platform transmissions, following search and detection of the randomly received platform transmissions in a compressed-time expanded-frequency domain. The processed data is stored aboard the satellite for readout every 108 minutes (orbital period), and platform locational coordinates and/or velocity components are determined in a central ground data processing facility. TWERLE system performance design goals are ±5 km position location, ±1 meter/second velocity determination, and 1000 platforms/orbit multiple access accommodation."
"The NIMBUS Meteorological Satellite will carry a system designed to receive electronic platform signals. The Doppler data is processed to provide estimates of their location and velocity. The current system provides for a location estimation accuracy of about 1 KM and component velocity estimation accuracy of about 1 M/S. The estimates, however, can be perturbed by various suspected noise sources. These effects are assessed to provide a measure of robustness of the estimation process."
"This paper describes the balloon instrumentation system which provides the one-way link for data gathering and navigation in the Tropical Wind, Energy conversion and Reference Level Experiment (TWERLE). In this experiment 400 instrumented constant-level balloons will be launched at the southern hemisphere during 1975. The Random Access Measurement System (RAMS) on board the NIMBUS-F satellite, will comprise the receiving end of the link. The data encoder, stable oscillator, transmitter and antenna are described, as well as two supporting components, the power source and the magnetic cutdown. These six items weigh 850 g. The oscillator-transmitter consume 1.9 W dc power to provide 0.6 W phase modulated RF power. Standby dc power consumption is 0.3 W."
"The overall Buoy Transmit Terminal (BTT) to Nimbus-F Satellite, RAMS (Random Access Measurement System) concept is examined. This system provides a dual position fixing and communication function. A general approach to meeting the BTT requirements is discussed. The paper continues with a discussion of the development of the various BTT elements which make it ideally suited for placement on-board buoys with small payloads. Sample performance parameters, derived from test data, are presented to provide a measure of familiarity with the BTT and its applications."
"A new approach for measuring winds, temperature and humidity in the tropics has been developed which utilizes high-altitude superpressure balloons and a communications or data-collection satellite for data relay. A large balloon is used to carry a load dropsondes which are individually released upon command from a synchronous satellite. These sondes telemeter Omega navigation signals, temperature and humidity data to the mother balloon which also serves as a data relay terminal to a synchronous satellite. The satellite in turn transmits the data to a ground station. Upon reception the data are processed in a large computer to recover the meteorological measurements. The National Center for Atmospheric Research is sponsored by the National Science Foundation."

"The mutual coherence function is derived for the scattered field due to a plane wave incident on the surface of the sea. The analysis is based on first order small perturbation theory, and neglects composite surface effects. The concept of an interferometer measuring the space correlation function of the scattered field providing information leading to the determination of the wave number spectrum of the sea surface is demonstrated. Assuming that the sea has a Phillips spectrum with a low cutoff number determined by the wind, a number of the basic physical properties of the proposed device are examined."
"The first-order correction to the approximate proportionality between the brightness temperature and the specific intensity of radiation which is usually assumed to hold in the near earth environment at microwave frequencies is examined. Corrections as large as 7°K in the vicinity of 300 GHz are shown to be required. It is shown that the influence of this correction can be incorporated into solutions of the low frequency form of the radiative transfer equation simply by a change in the boundary conditions describing the downward flowing flux at the top of the earth's atmosphere."
"A new type of marine water-height sensing device has been designed and built for use as a tide gauge. Primary prerequisites for the instrument were inexpensive construction, avoidance of moving parts, reliability of operation in a marine environment, and direct computer interface for automated data acquisition. The resultant instrument employs carbon electrodes fixed to a polyvinyl chloride pipe, and remote electronics to sense water level in the pipe. The electronics were designed so as to minimize current through the electrodes. The design is adaptable to different tidal ranges and resolutions, and could also be used as a wave-height sensor."
"The response of a general induction sonde in a heterogeneous formation is computed using a difference potential technique. This difference potential method effectively transforms the source coil singularities into a continuum of finite sources distributed throughout the formation. The resulting equations are solved via finite-difference techniques. The apparent conductivity responses are corroborated by the solutions of an integral equation formulation for two invaded thin bed examples and a homogeneous formation example."

  "The experimental program to date has concentrated on the forecaster's work station. By presenting field forecasters with a simulated problem, we were able to identify several important features to be enhanced and several to be changed. The most important feature to be enhanced was the flexibility in creating individual work stations. Smaller units, with specialized func-tions, that could be linked together in various combi, nations, appear to be highly desirable. The forecast preparation function was indentified as the most critical for design of the work station. This function places more emphasis on alphanumeric (KCRT) and message composition devices than on graphic displays. The use of KCRT devices for forecast preparation has several advantages including cost. Beyond the technical details of the work station, we learned much about the idiosyncrasies of the forecasters. A significant number wear bifocals, for example, and the orientation of displays is particularly important. The development of one horizontal keyboard for all hardware control functions is another change to be considered. From the field forecasters we also gained insight into the training required. The mechanics of AFOS are easily learned, but adaption into forecasters' work routines will be more difficult. However, considering the high skill level of National Weather Service field people, \"overkill\" on training should be avoided. The local data base needs to be enhanced. To this end, the parallel programs leading to automating surface, radar and upper air observations are being interfaced with AFOS."
"The primary interface between the AFOS system and the National Weather Service (NWS) forecaster lies within the area of meteorological forecast applications. Although AFOS will benefit the present system in many ways, it will also allow for new applications and different packaging of guidance material. Two such efforts are now in progress. The first of these concerns the automatic monitoring and updating of aviation terminal weather forecasts. Specifically, the AFOS system minicomputer will be programmed to compare each surface observation with the terminal forecast and determine if a problem or a potential problem exists. If so, a message will be automatically generated which will alert the forecaster to the situation and provide him with an objective forecast of ceiling and visibility. The second effort concerns the generation and updating of computer-worded public forecasts. The initial forecast, along with a guidance matrix, will be generated centrally and transmitted via the National Distribution Circuit to the forecast office. The forecaster can accept the forecast as is, make minor changes through text editing the message, or make major changes. Updating to include major revisions requires that the forecast be regenerated, this time on the local AFOS minicomputer."
"A Man-Computer Interactive Data Access System (McIDAS) has been developed for image processing and analysis. The hardware and software design of McIDAS is outlined with specific regards to the meteorological user. A variety of image processing techniques have been implemented on McIDAS for use with many kinds of images, in particular, ATS, ERTS-A, Mariner X, and SMS-A satellite data. A flexible digital image enhancement system is included in the McIDAS design. Special mention is made of the NAVIGATION, WINDCO, and CLDHGT systems which were developed for the purpose of aligning time sequences of geosynchronous satellite pictures, and determining the motion and height of selected cloud targets. The support which McIDAS can provide to the TV broadcasting community is also discussed."
"The Man-computer Interactive Data Access System (McIDAS) is a combination of hardware and software developed for processing image data from high volume data sources such as satellites. This paper describes the use of McIDAS. Key features of McIDAS are: color television display with capability for rapid (up to 30 frames/sec) sequencing of set of images, analog and digital data storage, interactive data processing and display control, data flow and processing controlled by computer software, data processing by accessing subsets of data. Uses of McIDAS include: measuring cloud velocities from geosynchronous satellites, calibrating cloud pictures for rain from radar, classifying land use from ERTS images, assembling weather data for public broadcast."

"An experiment was performed to determine the fading characteristics of backscattered radar signals from four agricultural targets at 9 GHz. The targets included two different row crops (corn and soybeans), a continuous canopy (alfalfa) and bare ground. After a short review of the statistics of Rayleigh fading backscatter, the data processing method and the results of the experiment are analyzed. Comparison with theory shows adequate agreement with the experimental results provided crop type, soil moisture condition and incidence angle are correctly incorporated in the target model. Because recent studies indicate that a high degree of precision is required for mapping vegetotion types with radar, it is necessary to acquire as much a priori knowledge of target fading characteristics as possible."
"This paper describes a low cost Omega-sonde data acquisition system consisting of a portable shipboard raw data recording package and a minicomputer interface used in the data reconstruction. The Omega phase is detected against a crystal controlled reference signal. The detected relative phase is recorded in digital form using timing signals controlled by the same crystal oscillator. The meteorological information is recorded in analog form. The data are stored on two-track audio tape cassettes which are processed via the interface and a minicomputer to yield IBM compatible computer tapes. The interface converts both the phase and the meteorological data to parallel-bit format. The recorded meteorological data (frequency) is counted and digitized using a clock signal which is phase-locked to the recorded phase data timing signal. The effects of tape wow and flutter on the meteorological data are thus reduced considerably. Samples of recovered phase and meteorological data are included."
"In order to obtain in situ measurements, to several meters depth in a marine sediment, of compressional wave speed and attenuation, a device has been built for attachment to ocean bottom sediment corers. This profilometer consists of transducers on the lower end of the coring tool which are connected by armored cables to an electronics package on the upper end of the tool, thus allowing acquisition of acoustical data with a minimum of modification to a standard corer. Early measurements with a prototype profilometer, which required electrical cables to the surface, established the accuracy and usefulness of the technique. The new deep water version of the profilometer is self contained including provisions for recording the data in the electronics package on the corer. Design operating water depth for the new system is 5 km. Test results for the new profilometer are presented including several high resolution in situ sound speed profiles to 12 m depth in deep water (4.5 km) sediments. Detailed layering is described including a high strength, high water content layer, several thin high speed sand layers, and several low speed layers. The data indicate that the near surface low speed zone in these sediments is composed of several thin low speed layers imbedded in a higher speed matrix."
"A technique is described for utilizing a hybrid computer as a time code reader and digitizer. The NASA 36-bit time code is an absolute time reference for digitizing analog signals to 1 mV resolution at a 1 kHz sampling rate. The analog computer circuit and the operation of the merged analog and digital computer systems is described. A result of this digitization process applied to analog signals recorded on magnetic tape during an Auroral sounding rocket flight is given as an example. This is a general technique that could be applied to other areas such as geology, meteorology, oceanography, and seismology."
"Optical devices currently used for crosswind measurements are calibrated and results interpreted on the basis of theoretical predictions. However, under strong turbulence conditions, the experimental observations do not compare well with the theoretical predictions. This deficiency can be overcome by use of a learning machine which utilizes a pattern recognition technique. Basically this approach substitutes observed experience for a detailed knowledge of the physical model. The technique utilizes a minicomputer to process observed spectral profiles. In the training phase spectral features, which are weakly intercorrelated but strongly correlated with the crosswind, are selected and classified with known winds. These data are stored in the machine. During the execution phase, the observed spectral features are compared with the previously stored classifications to yield a best estimate of the crosswind. Experimental results are presented which quantify the performance of this method."

"An investigation into the effects of hydrostatic pressure and tape thickness on the ac breakdown strengths and discharge inception stresses for various lapped dielectrics impregnated with liquid nitrogen is described. Dielectric losses are given for composite dielectrics measured at a temperature of 77.3 K and a pressure of 1.7 × 1055 N/m2 (10 psig). Analysis of the results shows that discharges occur in gas bubbles in the butt gaps of the lapped tapes and that increase in the hydrostatic pressure applied to the system increases the discharge inception stress. This suppression of discharges can also lead to an increase in the breakdown strengths of the dielectrics studied."
"Prebreakdown currents flowing between a pair of planeparallel sterling-silver electrodes are measured as a function of gap length in ultrahigh vacuum (~10-9torr). The emitted currents are found to follow the Fowler-Nordheim (FN) field-emission theory. The electric-field enhancement factor (ß) at the cathode is determined both before and after subjecting the electrodes to repeated breakdowns. Prior to sparking the electrodes ß is found to increase from 160 to 320 over the gap length 0.38-3.04 mm. After sparking the electrodes ß increases from 136 to 220 with increasing electrode separation in the range d=0.25-2.54 mm. The effect of sparking is to decrease the value of ß at a fixed gap length. It is also observed that repeated sparkings of the electrodes result in a considerable decrease in the emitted current (by up to three orders of magnitude) at a fixed gap length and a fixed applied voltage. The vacuum breakdown potential is measured in the range d=0.25-3.04 mm. It is found to increase linearly with increasing gap length up to d = 1.5 mm at which a transition to the Cranberg-clump mechanism of vacuum breakdown ensues. For d=1.5 mm the breakdown voltage follows a dependence law on distance to the power of 0.41. The critical electric field at breakdown is determined to be (7.7 ± 0.7) × 10-9 Vm-1 in the range d=0.25-2.54 mm."
"Kraft paper is used for insulation in oil-immersed equipment such as transformers. The reason is that Kraft paper has given satisfactory performance on electrical and mechanical properties. As for life, however, thermal degradation occurs due to temperature rise in operation. Examples of these kinds of the Kraft paper are cyanoethylated Kraft paper and amine modified Kraft paper. Kraft paper containing morpholine, oxyalkylamine, aromatic polyamine, para-toluene-sulfone, etc., are well known. This paper describes a method for thermally upgrading Kraft paper using carbamate compound. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1) n-Butyl carbamate is effective for thermally upgrading Kraft paper. 2) n-Butyl carbamate modified paper does not contaminate transformer oil."
"A new method of investigation into the voltage endurance of solid dielectrics is described. This method is founded upon measurements of the short-time electric strength of specimens prestressed by the same magnitude of ac voltage but for different times. By plotting electric strength against the aging time and comparing the experimental points with theoretical patterns, obtained by a theory previously put forward, determination of the coefficient of voltage endurance n is possible in a short time and with good precision. To check the results, other means are also used. The experimental data are plotted on the Weibull paper in order to determine the dimensional coefficient b which is closely related to n. Measurements of nondestructive properties are carried out, too; according to the aging theory remarked above it seems possible, in fact, to determine the coefficent n by means of such measurements. After showing the theoretical background of the new research, experimental data, pertinent to solid insulating materials for medium-and high-voltage cables, are reported. For polyethylene (PE) the data agree very well with the theory, for a value of n equal to 13. Ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) shows an uneven period in the first hours of stressing, after which the material seems to settle with a high value of n, larger than 20. In both cases the new method has shown its great usefulness in arriving at the result in a very short time and with high reliability."
"The theory of stress distribution in the insulation of high-voltage direct current (dc) cables is refined by accurately including the effects of heating by the leakage current. The results have specific implications with respect to thermal instability; in particular, a new type of instability is identified. Numerical examples are presented, and certain published experimental data are shown to support the theoretical results."

"The IEEE Group on Electrical Insulation is responsible for leadership, coordination, and communication between chemists, engineers, mathematicians, and physicists who are concerned with dielectric phenomena and behavior, with development and characterization of all gaseous, liquid, and solid electrical insulating materials, and with utilization of these dielectric materials in electrical and electronic circuits and systems under all conditions of use. The IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation is published to provide a permanent record of the expanding corpus of scientific and technical knowledge required by all IEEE members and others interested in the interdisciplinary field of dielectrics and electrical insulation. This Transactions is edited to encourage deeper understanding and greater effectiveness in observing, classifying, interpreting, and reporting facts and theories germane to dielectric behavior and properties of electrical insulating materials. Thoughtfully prepared and carefully documented papers dealing with fundamental concepts of dielectric behavior, with original theoretical and experimental studies, and with reproducible means of evaluating performance of materials and equipment are most appropriate.

"The theory of voltage gradients in the insulation of high-voltage dc cables insulated with oil-impregnated paper is refined by including the effects of power losses within the insulation. The analysis is performed by means of perturbation theory, which yields formulas that are more convenient to use than the more exact results derived in a companion paper."
"The goal was to develop a simple method for determining the dependence of dielectric constant and loss tangent on frequency in the range 10-200 MHz for a number of dielectrically lossy liquid resins. A test cell was devised which could be used with an available Hewlett-Packard RX meter. The calculations were worked out based on a calibration of cell constants and series inductance determined with five standard liquids. Data for five commercial resins and four curing agents are given. The method provides 5-percent or better accuracy up to 200 MHz."
"The effect of dissolved gases in mineral oil on conduction currents and conduction current pulses at high fields has been investigated. For a given stress, larger gaps resulted in increased conduction currents as well as current pulses. Oxygen, nitrogen, and air dissolved at small equilibrium pressures (1 torr) resulted in a reduction in the number of current pulses of various magnitudes. However, increasing the oxygen content to 20 torr gave more pulse activity. The results are discussed by considering a model which invokes both cathode and anode space charges."
"Experimental data are presented describing the relationship between the dissipation factor of capacitors containing polypropylene film impregnated with trichlorodiphenyl and the applied voltage, the duration of the applied voltage, and the thickness of the liquid layer adjacent to the polymer film. A general theoretical treatment based on the equivalent circuit representation of a low-loss polymer capacitor in series with a high-loss liquid capacitor provides a qualitative explanation of the experimental data. The results demonstrate that ion conduction in the thin liquid layers between the impregnated polymer and the electrodes can account for the observed dissipation factor. The ion transit time across the liquid layer is very short compared to the period of a half-cycle so the ions are immobilized on the film or foil surfaces for a large fraction of each half-cycle. The ion transit time and consequently the dissipation factor are strong functions of the applied field and the thickness of the liquid layer. These factors as well as a trapping of the ions by the film causing the dissipation factor to decrease with time on voltage must be considered in interpreting the dissipation factor data of impregnated polymers and in attaining the potentially low losses possible in these systems."
"An investigation into the repetition rate and magnitude of internal discharges in artificial cavities in epoxy resin, polyethylene, and mica, using a multichannel pulse height analyzer is described. The effect of time of voltage application, cavity dimensions, and location, and opening the cavity or ventilating it in air and nitrogen has been studied. The results indicate that it is the discharge quantity rather than the discharge energy measured externally in the largest pulse that is important. It is suggested that in order to correlate discharge damage with discharge activity, it is essential to measure continuously both discharge magnitudes and repetition rates."

 "It is shown that two mechanisms are encountered in metal migration in glass-a platelike and treelike growth mechanism. The treelike growth, requiring a much higher interfacial energy contribution, is favored by high voltage application. The interaction of these two mechanisms accounts for the unexpected voltage and gap dependence of the niigration rate. The location of the metallic growth has been established as being in the volume of the glass. Significant differences exist in the electrical characteristics of the substrates of different manufacturers. After the application of glass dams these differences become less pronounced."
"Measurements of temperature histories of epoxy/glass prepreg layers during multilayer printed wiring board lamination have been recently obtained. It is shown that the temperature histories may be predicted by an analysis of the transient heat flow process within the multilayer board (MLB). The analysis requires a knowledge of the press platen temperature history during laminations and the thermal resistance of the padding material. Theoretically predicted results show close agreement with the experimental data for both 5-layer and 15-layer MLB's using the \"hot press\" as well as the \"cold press\" cycles. The present method may be used in the design of MLB lay-ups, in particular the determination of the necessary padding thickness to achieve heating rates which give adequate timing \"windows\" for cure pressure applications. The present theory has been applied to study the effect of kraft paper padding on the prepreg temperatures. Results are shown for both 15-and 5-layer laminations employing the hot press as well as cold press cycles. The number of kraft paper sheets used is shown to have a significant bearing on the temperatures."
"This paper presents the results of a study to identify the thermal characteristics of the laminating process for multilayer printed wiring boards (MLB's). MLB's with 5 and 15 conducting layers were studied by embedding thermocouples into the epoxy/glass bonding sheets during the \"hot-press\" lamination process. An effort was made to isolate the important parameters governing thermal variation during hot-press lamination and to determine the thermal timing \"window\" for cure-pressure application necessary for uniform resin flow. The results show that whereas the temperature of the bonding sheets in a 5-layer MLB are practically identical, the temperature in 15-layer MLB's differs in excess of 37°F (20.50°C). The study also concludes that the lag between the time the lay-up is inserted and the press is closed governs temperature differences for a given MLB. Under laboratory conditions, the lag can be as small as 4 s;typically in production, however, the lag is 80 s for multiopening presses. It is these temperature variations that can cause voids, cured thickness variations, measle tendencies, and delamination, resulting in high proportions of defective MLB's. These temperature differences can be reduced either by increasing the padding thickness or by employing a \"cold-press\" lamination process. The effectiveness of these methods is also discussed."
"Conformal coating materials and processes were comparatively tested and evaluated for protection of electronic equipment. An extensive literature search was conducted for various generic types of conformal coating materials and processes. Testing and evaluation of candidate coating systems were accomplished using printed circuitry coupons, critical components, electronic assemblies, and flexible printed wiring circuitry to determine retention of electrical properties after temperature and humidity conditioning."

"Ultrasonic techniques are useful for the detection and location of partial discharge or corona sources associated with HV power apparatus, particularly oil-filled power transformers. Measurements are commonly made using narrow-band transducers operating in the frequency range from ~20kHz to ~300 kHz, and occasionally at higher frequencies for which there is little published information. Because of the lack of available data on the spectra of ultrasonic emissions from discharges in oil-insulation systems, an investigation was initiated to determine if there was an optimum measuring frequency and whether discharges could be identified by their spectral characteristics. It was discovered that insulation voids and gap-type discharges, for example, have clearly identifiable ultrasonic frequency characteristics, and the actual physical size of voids may be estimated from their frequency spectra."
"A wide-band peak voltage detector is presented, which is used for measuring partial discharges in submarine telecommunication cable systems. For high-voltage discharge detection of simple dielectric geometries or complete power filters, the wide-band detector is suitable for laboratory or factory use. A low-cost low-resolution amplitude-distribution analyzer can be assembled by combining several detectors for the special requirements of high-voltage dc testing, at a small fraction of the cost of a commercial distribution analyzer."
"Vacuum insulation with cylindrical ceramic spacer insulators has been studied with respect to changes of its ac flashover voltage with time. The distributions of times to failure, which were found to confirm Weibull's distribution, were used for plotting the regression curves for times up to 350 h. The results show that even at rather low stresses the flashover voltage decreased in time. This phenomenon is connected with the recorded deposition of metal particles from the electrodes on the surface of the spacers during the tests. This possibility of the decrease of the flashover voltage, induced by the deconditioning effects of contaminating conducting particles generated under the working stress by the system itself, must be taken into account when considering the suitableness of using special means of increasing the short-time flashover voltage of vacuum insulation for cryocables."
"The results of a series of experiments performed in sulphur hexafluoride gas for pressures up to 100 psig (0.68 MN/m2) are described. Uniform field electrodes and both dc and standard impulse voltages were used. The volume resistivity of the dielectric material used was considered to be a significant parameter, and for this reason some graphite loaded coatings were Also used. The results indicate that the breakdown voltages were lowered by graphite loading of the material. Prebreakdown currents, not unexpectedly, were lower for higher resistivity coatings. In some cases the withstand voltage was more than three times that for uncoated electrodes. Small sized particulate contamination did not seriously affect the voltage withstand. Considerable surface charging of the coating was also observed in many cases."
"The dielectric properties (ac and dc) and the viscosity of an insulating oil and its aromatic and nonaromatic fractions are compared. The results indicate that the properties of the whole oil cannot be determined ined from the properties of its components and their concentrations. A model based on dipole interaction is presented and is shown to- account for the observed results."
"The knowledge of the impregnation mechanism of porous solid insulation seems useful to ascertain the reaching of optimum insulating properties, but the problem has been scarcely dealt with in the literature, perhaps because of the high analytical difficulties resulting if a theoretical approach accounting for all the relevant phenomena is taken. A simplified mathematical model of pressboard monodimensional impregnation with transformer oil is presented, and a method for an experimental evaluation of model parameters is developed. Results of a set of experimental tests carried out by different methods and under different conditions are reported together with experimental tests of breakdown strength during impregnation, and a satisfactory agreement with the model previsions is noted. Finally, plots of approximate values of model parameters for different pressboards are given."

  "An EMC Figure of Merit (FOM) for single-channel voice communications systems, based on the channel-denial concept, was developed by using a building-block approach. This approach assumes a co-site environment and involves the use of relatively simple scoring formulas for selected EMC parameters, which are linearly combined, with appropriate weighting factors, to calculate FOM's for transmitters, receivers, and systems (i. e., transmitter-receiver pairs). The parameters chosen for transmitters included spurious emissions, noise near the carrier (i. e., broadband emissions outside the band containing desired modulation components), and intermodulation products. The parameters chosen for receivers were spurious responses, adjacent-signal interactions, and intermodulation products. The parameter scoring formulas were developed to reflect the frequency spectrum denied by each parameter. A channel was considered denied if (S+N+I)/ (N+I) < 10 dB in a moderately dense co-site environment. The weighting factors for the building-block approach were determined by running a computer program that kept track of the number of channels denied by each parameter. Example calculations for HF, VHF, and UHF systems are given, and the interpretation of the scores is discussed. The procedure developed enables quantification of the EMC characteristics of transmitting and receiving equipment. The EMC FOM provides system planners, design engineers and managers with a tool for making objective, consistent decisions. It also has potential value for those concerned with the formulation of EMC specifications and standards. It does not, however, indicate the absolute probability that compatibility will be obtained; rather, it gives information about the relative chance of obtaining compatibility."

"A method of detecting significant sources of ship topside intermodulation is presented which represents a major extension in capability and ease of use. The method involves a two-frequency test procedure and the use of elementary direction finding techniques. Deliberate concentration on interfering signals of the high order is the basis of the method. A computational scheme is presented which permits the determination of the lowest intermodulation product or order contributing to a given interfering signal."
"Measurements of power line conducted interference are commonly made on commercial equipment throughout the world using line impedance stabilization network (LISN's) in accordance with industrial and governmental procedures. Procedures in the United States applying to the 0.15-30 MHz frequency range specify an LISN that presents a frequency-dependent RF impedance to the equipment under test (EUT) whereas other national practices specify as LISN having an invariant 150-ohm impedance. This paper explores the expected measurement differences resulting from use of the two LISN's for power line interference measurements. Calculated difference factors, which depend on the EUT power line RF-input impedance, are developed. The factors have utility in assessing expected conducted interference levels in one LISN measurement configuration, given the interference levels and impedance parameters of the other. Measurement differences, in addition to those introduced by the LISN, which are attributed to variations in specified field strength meter parameters (i. e., detector, bandwidth, mechanical time constants, etc.) are beyond the scope of this paper."
"In the operational use of mobile communication terminals, it may often be unavoidable to park them in a location where they would be subject to ignition noise due to local traffic. This type of noise causes errors in digital systems. Since it is impossible to define a general model for impulsive noise, one must measure the necessary statistical paramaters to be used for calculating its effect on a communication link. Although these parameters vary for different types of links, peak amplitude distribution, time distribution, and duration of impulses at various amplitude levels should be known. In this paper noise amplitude distribution (NAD) measurements carried out on the VHF/UHF bands for ignition noise are explained. The information derived from the NAD is the peak amplitude distribution of the impulses; in addition, the average repetition frequency of the impulses is also obtained. An analytical expression is found for the probability density function of the idealized NAD."
"The effects of impulsive noise on phase-locked loop (PLL) FM demodulators is investigated. The PLL FM demodulator used for the experiments is basically a second order loop employing an active filter. The impulsive noise used for this work is ignition noise. Impulse response of the receiver is investigated and the PLL FM demodulator is digitally simulated. The response of the receiver employing the PLL FM demodulator used in the ground terminal to an input signal consisting of unmodulated carrier and impulses is investigated experimentally. The system margin is fouind to be degraded by about 10 dB."
"An analysis of the shielding effectiveness of braidedwire shields is made using the parameters of the woven wire and the theory of electromagnetic coupling through small irises. The coupling through the rhombic-shaped holes in the braid is approximated by using the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of elliptical holes of the same width and length as the rhombus. The analysis develops the transfer impedance and the mutual capacitance of the shield. The transfer impedance is calculated and plotted for shields of different optical coverages. The variation of mutual capacitance and mutual inductance with the weave angle of the braid are examined."
"Computation of the incidental, quasi-peak electric field intensity detected by an airborne, tuned, horizontal dipole antenna has been performed using a symmetrical representation of measured, surface man-made incidental radio noise data and the radiation field integral for the observed power at a height, h, above the surface. The derived electric field intensity as a function of observer altitude is compared with the results of four sets of measurements obtained over central Tokyo by Ishida for heights lying between 0.3 and 3 km. The comparisons reveal that the dependence upon altitude of the predicted quasi-peak electric field strength agrees with the observed trends and, further, that the measured and predicted field intensities display an average difference of less than 0.7 dB. These results and experimental comparisons for a tuned, airborne, horizontal dipole antenna complement the experimental confirmations of a comparable analysis previously reported for vertical, tuned, airborne dipole and monopole antennas."
"A theoretical model is defined for an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) simulator for testing EMP effects on high altitude satellites. The simulator is composed of three flat-plate transmission line sections. The first and third sections are tapered to accommodate, respectively, a generator and a terminating resistor. This problem is analyzed in the frequency domain over those frequency components which are known to contribute most significantly to a typical EMP waveform. The analysis uses a numerical technique to solve the basic problem of an unknown current distribution on a curved, tapered strip, excited by a known electric field. The unknown current is solved by the method of moments, using triangular basis functions. As a check, input impedances are computed for the triangular dipole, showing good agreement with experimental results. For the transmission line simulator, computed input impedance, VSWR, power dissipated in the terminating resistor, and the power lost to radiation are presented as a function of frequency. The computed current distributions are used to calculate the electric fields between and immediately beyond the parallel plates. Although a considerable portion of power is converted to radiation at the higher frequencies, it is shown that at least within the working volume the electric field maintains a reasonably constant level."
"The transmission characteristics of transient electromagnetic pulses in biological material are studied using a plane wave pulse incident normally on a semi-infinite layer model. With the dispersion properties of complex tissue dielectric constants taken into account, the steady state transfer function was examined as a function of frequency. Integral solutions for the transmitted field of a Gaussian pulse were obtained through Fourier transformation. The transmitted waveforms inside muscle were determined numerically for various depths pertinent to biological situations. The results suggest that incident pulse experiences severe reflection at the airtissue interface and, shorter pulses are transmitted more readily than longer ones. For an incident pulse of 50 kV/m and 1 us in pulsewidth, the transmitted amplitude is 221 V/m."
"The near-zone field components 27πρ | Hϕ (ρ;z) |, 27πρ | E(ρz) | and 2(π/ß) | Ez(ρ;z) | are determined numerically for a monopole of length h and radius a erected vertically over a perfectly conducting half-space of infinite extent. Curves are supplied for the field under the following conditions: (a) ßh = π/2, Ω = 2 ln (2h/a) = 8.531, a/λ0 = 7.022 × 10-3, 1.01 ≤ ρρ;/a = 100, 0 ≤ z ρ h; (b) ßh = π,Ω = 9.917, 1.01 ≤ /a = 100, 0 ≤ z ≤h. Here ß = 2π/λ0 is the free-space propagation constant. Unit voltage is applied to the base of the monopole by means of a coaxial cable having a characteristic impedance of Zc = 50 ohms."
"A number of papers have appeared during recent years about electromagnetic waves produced by antenna currents with the time variation of Walsh functions rather than that of sinusodial functions. Experimental transmitters and receivers for such waves have been developed. There are a variety of effects of Walsh waves that do not exist for sinusoidal waves or are so obscure that they are generally not recognized. This makes a discussion of these effects difficult for the nonspecialist. The range-Doppler resolution in radar lends itself more readily to a discussion, since Walsh waves bring in this case not a new effect, but only a substantial improvement of a well-known one. It is shown that our present technology should permit an improvement of about one order of magnitude in the Doppler resolution by using carriers derived from Walsh or other two-valued functions rather than sinusoidal functions. The theoretical improvement of the relative range resolution is substantially greater since it no longer depends upon the duration of the modulating signal but upon the period of the carrier and the switching time of the carrier. The absolute range measurement is not changed."
"This paper draws attention to the fact that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the theory of linear time-invariant systems and linear dyadic invariant systems. It then proceeds to extend the use of random processes in conjunction with spectral analysis technique to identifying multiple input-multiple output dyadic systems. Emphasis is placed upon the role played by coherence functions in measuring the goodness of the identification."

 "The time and amplitude statistics illustrated are important and useful in describing the time-dependent, measured electromagnetic (EM) noise in mines. They are 1) Allan variance analyses (AVA), 2) interpulse spacing distributions (ISD), 3) pulse duration distributions (PDD), 4) average crossing rates (ACR), and 5) amplitude probability distributions (APD). These statistics are illustrated using a rather large store of raw analog data measured in operatioal mines through computer software techniques. The curves generated for the figures characterize the noise environment in the mines from which the corresponding data were taken, and should aid in the design of reliable communication systems for such mines."
"A simple expression is presented for the attenuation of signals along an overhead conductor with a ground return. The formula appears to be sufficiently accurate to provide useful estimates of the line attenuation up to frequencies for which the conductor height is of the order of a quarter wavelength."
"Phase controlled systems (PCS) built with nonlinear inductor filters for radio frequency interference (RFI) suppression give irregularites in the radio noise spectrum. These irregularities are important for the measurement of the RFI behavior of the PCS and the design of RFI filters. A theory is given that explains the most important observed effects. It is shown that the theory leads to a more practical definition of the RFI suppression activity of the nonlinear inductor."
"Data on transient-voltage environment are needed for the specification. and design of reliable transit-system electrical equipment, especially those containing semiconductor devices. Such data taken on the 600-V dc propulsion systems of the Chicago Transit. Authority (CTA) and the Long Island Railroad (LIRR) are presented. Transient-voltage counters, supplemented by an automatic cathode ray oscilloscope, were used to monitor transient voltages in substations, wayside switching stations and transit cars. The 37.5-V dc battery line was also monitored on board one transit car on the LIRR system. This program spanned a period of two and a half years. Theoretical analysis on the characteristics of transients caused by lightning and switching is also presented."
"The distributions of current and charge induced on the surface of electrically thin metal cylinders by an external electromagnetic field are described by means of theoretically and experimentally determined graphs. Various possible standing-wave patterns are shown including some with unexpected properties such as the coincidence of current and charge minima. A knowledge of these distributions is essential to the determination of the shielding properties of imperfectly conducting cylinders and cylinders with small aperttires. It is also a prerequisite o an understanding of currents and charges on crossed metal cylinders including aircraft exposed to an electromagnetic pulse. The significance of the location of the junction in the standing-wave patterns is pointed out."

"A new recursive formula for defining Walsh functions on the real line is presented. It leads, in a natural way, to an explicit representation of Walsh futctions. The explicit representation can be identified with. the representation of Walsh functions by the products of Rademacher functions. It can also lead to other representations of Walsh functions in a straight-forward manner. Using the new-formulation, one can prove many known properties of Walsh functions easily and systematically and gain new insight."
"An algorithm for computing the correlations of Walsh functions is presented. Given indices j and p between 0 and 2n - 1, the algorithm computes the correlation between the jth and kth Walsh-Paley function at time differences t = i2-n, i =0,1,..., 2n - 1. These values specify the correlation completely as it varies linearly between these points. A Fortran program is shown. The time required to compute a complete 2n point correlation is approximately the same as that of a 2n point fast Walsh transform."
"The availability of digital computer time and scientific programming languages (such as Fortran) has, resulted in the use of the digital computer for electromagnetic pulse (EMP) coupling analyses. This report describes combining complex frequency domain analysis techniques with the SCEPTRE computer program to evaluate the time response of the current induced on a thin-wire scatterer when the scatterer has been excited by an arbitrary shaped electromagnetic pulse. The method is illustrated by performing an analysis for the current which would be induced by a fast rise time EMP (unit step) and a relatively slow rise time EMP (waveshape similar to that produced by a lightning stroke)."
"The computation of a real Hadamard (or Walsh) transform can be simplified by first computing a pseudotransform, employing an easily derived auxiliary matrix each of whose elements is either l or 0 (instead of 1 or -1), and then applyimg se very simple linear corrections to obtain the; desired transform. The auxiliary matrix is not orthogonal, so its square, unlike that of the Hadamard (or Walsh) matrix, is, not a scalar matrix. However, sibject to one easilyg satisfied restrietion, it has an inverse, Which, within a scalar. multiplier, differs from ihgt of the Hadamard (or Wtalh) matrix of the same order in only a single element."

"Attenuation measurements were made in the 1 to 1000 MHz frequency range in two wet-granite tunnels leading to an underground facility. The purpose of the measurements was to determine the vulnerability of the facility to interfering electromagnetic radiation. Continuous-wave signals were propagated within the tunnels and the signal levels at various distances from the transmitter were measured with a spectrum analyzer. Measurements were made using antennas to launch and receive the signals and also using baluns to conduct the signals directly to longitudinal metallic structures. These structures consisted of ventilation ducts and of the sheaths on power cables and coaxial cables. At low frequencies, the path attenuation was on the order of 2 dB/100 ft. (0.07 dB/m). The results show that this low attenuation probably resulted from the presence of the longitudinal metallic structures in the tunnels. The maximum path attenuation occurred at 50 MHz in one tunnel and at 200 MHz in the other (smaller tunnel). Then, at higher frequencies, it is thought that propagation occured in a waveguide-like manner. At the higher frequencies, it was found that bends in the tunnels significantly increased the attenuation. It is concluded that if interfering signals in the MHz range are anticipated, tunnels free of longitudial metallic structures should be used. To prevent interference by higher frequencies, where waveguide-like propagation occurs, tunnels should contain bends."
"The use of the linear antenna as a probe to measure both the constitutive parameters of material media and the electric field interior to such media is reviewed. The advantages of using probes with a particular geometry (i. e., electricaUy short, resonant, bare or insulated) for specific applications are discussed. Applications in the areas of geophysics and biophysics are cited."
"Light transmittance and the Rf shielding effectiveness of a gold film on a glass substrate is investigated. The dependence of the transmittance of visible light upon the thickness or surface resistance of a gold film on a glass substrate is determined numerically by the optical properties of the gold film and glass substrate. The Rf shielding effectiveness produced in the far field over the frequency range of 100 MHz to 30 GHz by the gold film is calculated and compared with experimental data. An optimum condition is established between the light transmittance and the shielding effectiveness. The results are applicable to any transparent glass coated with any thin metallic film."
"This work discusses the active circuit behavior of typical bipolar transistors as they are injected with low level microwave energy. The observed response is found to be due to square law rectification of the energy at the transistor's emitter-base junction. A rectification efficiency measurement'is described which gives a quantitative measure of a transistors sensitivity to microwave interference in terms of an equivalent rectified base current interference signal per unit of absorbed microwave power. Measurements show that a typical n-p-n Si planar transistor (FT = 450 MHz) has a rectification factor of approximately 0.05 mA/mW for 2 GHz microwave energy. Typically, this factor decreases at about 6 dB/octave as the interference carrier frequency is increased. A model for the rectification effect is propQsed which suggests that it is due to ac crowding and the decrease in transistor a at the edges of the emitter, in addition to the basic nonlinearity of the emitter-base junction volt-ampere characteristic."
"The electromagnetic susceptibility of UHF transistors is investigated. The 2N5179 RF amplifier type transistor was selected as a representative UHF transistor because of its chip structure. It is a silicon n-p-n epitaxial planar transistor with an interdigitated baseemitter metallization pattern. Several manufacturer's versions were tested. A single RF pulse at 240 MHz was applied directly to the base terminal with the emitter terminal grounded. The incident RF pulse power required to cause a 50 percent failure rate is in the 35-70 W range for a 3 μs pulse duration and in the 150-450 W range for a 0.3 , μs pulse duration. The primary variable is the percentage of the incident power absorbed by the transistor. The absorbed pulse energy required to cause a 50 percent failure rate is in the 20-35 μJoule range for 0.3-3.0, μs pulse durations. The gs pulse and CW RF burnout powers for 2N5179 transistors are similar to those for 1N23 mixer diodes. The data suggest that UHF receivers with an RF transistor amplifier front end may be as susceptible to intense EMR at UHF frequencies as are UHF receivers with a mixer diode front end."
"The Applications Technology Statellite-6 (ATS-6) has successfully withstood repeated entrances into and exits from occult in a period centered on the 1974 autumn equinox, during which it was subject to potential changes as hikh as 11 000 volts based on onboard measurements. Much of the outer surface of the spacecraft is an insulator, dictated by thermal control design. Consequently, special measures were required to protect the spacecraft, and especially its commmand receiving system, from electrical dischargesp whose accompanying fields could destroy sensitive receiving circuits. This paper describes the thermal blanket grounding criteria applied to prevent undesired discharge effects."
"The effect of ferromagnetic shields on the self and mutual inductances of the wires enclosed by a ferromagnetic shell has been theoretically analyzed. Some theoretical equations based on a simplified model, which assumes that the driving wires and returning wires are located within two separated magnetic shells, are derived. The analysis shows that the effect of the ferromagnetic shells on the inductance of the wires depends strongly on the separation of the two magnetic shells; the closer the two magnetic shells, the stronger the effect. For a configuration of two identical ferromagnetic shells of internal radius 0.65 cm and separated by 10 cm, it is estimated that the self and mutual inductances are increased by about 30 percent for a wire of radius 0.06 cm. The changes of the self and mutual inductances are essentially due to the interactions between the ferromagnetic shells and the induced fields of the current elements."
"The method of moments is applied to the computation of the charge distributions and capacitance matrix for electrostatic systems of bare and dielectric-coated cylindrical wires. Several choices of expansion functions are investigated in detail and compared. Harmonic series expansion functions are shown to be especially well suited to problems involving systems of closely-spaced dielectric-coated cylindrical wires."
"An automated model that calculates the frequency separation requirements for interference free operation of electronic systems located in a given environment is described. Using these frequency separation requirements, the model assigns a channel to each system in the environment based on the frequencies available to each. The model calculates inter system, antenna coupled interference levels only. It uses an iterative, but nonexhaustive, process which attempts to develop a compatible assignment. Preassignment checks are performed to determine if a complete assignment is impossible based on the number of frequencies available to each system and the separations between these frequencies. If an assignment is impossible, a partial assignmnent with the least number of deletions restults. Using the preassignment checks, the model can be used to determine a channel scheme for a new system that will conserve spectrum space and allow compatible operation in any given environment. The results of a recent application of the model to an environment of microwave landing guidance systems including the proposed MLS is given."
"The currents and charges induced in a pair of electrically thin crossed wires by a normally incident plane electromagnetic wave are derived by analytical methods. The boundary conditions at the ends and at the junction are explained. The solution of a new integro-differential equation for the currents is obtained in terms of trigonometric and integral-trigonometric functions. Depending on the electrical lengths of the crossed elements and location of their junction a variety of quite different distributions of current and charge obtain. These determine the scattered near and far fields. Graphs of computed currents and charges per unit length on the four arms of several important cases are displayed. The accurate determination of the induced currents and charges on a mathematically tractable structure-the thin-wire cross-is an early step in a study that will proceed to electrically thick cylinders, wide strips, and their junctions in crossed configurations in an effort to gain a meaningful approximate understanding of the currents and charges induced on an aircraft by an electromagnetic pulse."
"Relations are developed for the determination of the Fourier spectra of frequency-limited periodic waves from truncated Walsh spectra. The matrix conversion process is simplest if the highest-order Walsh coefficient in the spectru to be converted is 2n, where n is an integer. For such cases, compensation for truncation consists of a diagonal matrix that premultiplies the Walsh to Fourier conversion matrix and the elements of which are [(sinx)/x]-2 terms. Element values range between unity and less than π2/4. The same compensation matrix is used for determning the Walsh spectra. of sequency-limited waves from 2n Fourier expansion terms. Examples are included which demonstrate the spectral conversion processes, Walsh to Fourier and Fourier to Walsh."

 "This paper describes a novel procedure for determing the accuracy of hyperbolic multilateration systems. Basically, the procedure links the conventional accuracy measures (e. g., GDOP) to the moments and products of inertia of a mass configuration that is easily derived from the system geometry. Thus, the problem of determining accuracy measures is reduced to that of calculating simple moments and products of inertia. The insight provided by the procedure makes it possible to derive a variety of useful approximations for GDOP and other accuracy measures."
"A recently developed procedure [1] for assessing the accuracy of hyperbolic multilateration systems makes it easy to determine basic limitations on accuracy. This paper illustrates how such bounds can be derived. The results include bounds for a variety of geometries that are representative of practical ground-based and satellite-based hyperbolic systems. The results are applicable whenever the ranging errors can be treated as uncorrelated zeromean random variables. In some cases the bounds quantify general knowledge (e. g., the directional dependence of errors). In other cases the bounds represent entirely new limitations (e. g., optimum accuracies for sector-restricted and cone-restricted transmitter/receiver configurations)."
"This paper treats the problem of finding an orthogonal matrix which is the closest, in the Forbenius norm, to a given nonorthogonal matrix. This nonorthogonal matrix is the result of a fast but rather inaccurate computation of the well-known direction cosine matrix (DCM) of a strapdown inertial navigation system. The known closed-form solution to this problem is rederived using the directional derivative method, and the conditions for minimum distance are derived and discussed. A new iterative technique for solving this problem is derived as a result of the application of the gradient projection technique and the directional derivative method. The practical computational problems involved in this technique are discussed. The new technique is demonstrated by three examples. Although particular attention is given to the 3 X 3 direction cosine matrix, the conclusions are nonetheless valid higher order matries."
"The designer of a communication system often has knowledge concerning the changes in distance between transmitter and receiver as a function of time. This information can be exploited to reduce multipath interference via proper signal design. A radar or sonar may also have good a priori information about possible target trajectories. Such knowledge can again be used to reduce the receiver's response to clutter (MTI), to enhance signal-to-noise ratio, or to simplify receiver design. There are also situations in which prior knowledge about trajectories is lacking. The system should then utilize a single-filter pair which is insensitive to the effects induced by relative motion between transmitter, receiver, and reflectors. For waveforms with large time-bandwidth products, such as long pulse trains, it is possible to graphically derive signal formats for both situations (trajectory known and unknown). Although the exact form of the signal is sometimes not specified by the graphical procedure, the problem in such cases is reduced to one which has already been solved, i. e., the generation of an impulse equivalent code."
"The maximum-likelihood estimator of the line of position (LOP) resulting from K frequencies received from each of two Omega stations for high SNR is derived. The estimator takes advantage of interfrequency correlation of phase uncertainties by modeling them as resulting from phase velocity uncertainties which are jointly Gaussian with known covariance. The utilization of Omega for search and rescue systems is examined. For this application, the result of increasing the size of the unambiguous lanes of Omega by addition of a fourth frequency to the present three-frequency format is examined. The results of Monte Carlo simulation, performed for several easily implemented fourth frequencies, are presented. The simulation results illustrate the extent to which lane errors can be expected as a function of various fourth frequencies, phase velocity uncertainties, and SNR."
"An algorithm is described which finds optimum transmitter and receiver weights to maximize clutter suppression in a predetermined clutter region when using burst waveforms. It is assumed that the transmitter weights can only take on values from a finite set. This optimization problem is solved using a branch and bound algorithm. An example is given which shows the improvement in clutter suppression when this new design procedure is used as compared to a simpler nonoptimal procedure."
"An on-line two-dimensional optical processor has been used to process simulated linear and planar phased-array radar data off-line but at real-time data rates. The input transducer is an electron-beam-addressed KD2 PO4 light valve."
"This paper considers the detection of a sinusoidal or chirp signal imbedded in wideband FM interference (as might be generated by some types of active jamming), such that after pulse compression or other integration, the interference can be approximated by a sum of sinusoids of independent phase. The detection probability in such non-Gaussian noise is compared to that for Gaussian noise, with the Gaussian result approached, as required, in the limit that the number of sinusoids in the sum increases without bound. For detection using a comparison of the envelope with a threshold which yields a given false-alarm probability (CFAR detection), the detection probability is improved over the case of Gaussian noise, so that the usual approach basing the design on Gaussian noise would be conservative. Using a threshold determined from the envelope mean, the FM interference yields a lower false-alarm probability than for Gaussian noise, with detection probability only slightly degraded."
"A rigorous theory is developed for the course scalloping amplitudes observed in the bearing indications of an airborne standard VOR receiver in the presence of multipath signals. The VOR transmitting antenna pattern characteristics, the scattering properties of the multipath source, and the effects of ground reflection are all built into the theory so that their combined effects on the scalloping may be quantitatively investigated. The analysis assumes that the VOR receiver characteristics are ideal."
"The use of data obtained by a monopulse radar to estimate the location of the radar cross-section centroid of an ensemble of scatterers is discussed. Both dish and phased-array antenna radars are treated. Expressions for the bias and variance of the centroid estimates are presented, including the effects of the radar receiver and beam pattern characteristics, receiver noise, and the video waveform sampling granularity, as well as the target properties. The monopulse tracking approach discussed here is contrasted with a raster scan approach presented previously."
"An inverse filter, contained in a recently published paper by Senmoto and Childers, is improved by the application of a shaping function derived by Turin in an earlier paper."
"A processing technique based on pulse-cancellation techniques familiar in moving target indicator (MTI) radar is proposed for separating (in Doppler) echoes of a reentry body traveling at hypersonic velocities from those of its lower velocity turbulent wake appearing in the same range cell. The cancellation technique is implemented by forming the sum of the products of binomial weighting coefficients of alternating sign with the complex echoes of a small number of closely spaced transmitted coherent pulses; thereby, in effect, synthesizing a digital canceler. The ability of the two-and three-pulse canceler to estimate body RCS in the presence of attached wake is demonstrated by employing coherent burst data collected by the AMRAD radar for a mission flown at the White Sands Missile Range. Estimates of body RCS obtained from the two-and three-pulse canceler compare favorably to the corresponding estimates obtained from a 30-pulse Doppler periodogram for this mission. Expressions for both the achievable wake rejection ratio and the mean and standard deviation of the body power estimate of the N-pulse canceler are derived as a function of the wake parameters, assuming Gaussian wake statistics."
"Closed-form solutions for all the estimated power moments as a function of the number of independent samples were found for the linear and logarithmic receiver. Incoming signal envelope distribution is assumed to be Rayleigh. The estimates' expected value and standard deviations are plotted and compared with those of a square-law receiver. It is shown that the bias in the expected value for both receivers depends on the number of samples. Only when the number of samples is large does the bias become constant, and the standard deviation around the unbiased mean becomes inversely proportional to the square root of the number of samples. The logarithmic receiver produces the largest standard deviation. When the input samples are dependent, an expansion of the method is suggested to obtain approximate moments."
"A simple ionospheric prediction model is employed to determine the reduction in the positional estimate errors in HF hyperbolic position-fixing systems provided by the use of the model. Quantitative results of positional estimate errors before and after the application of the model to experimental time-delay data are compared."
  "A method of constructing digital phase reversal codes which have few nonzero sidelobes and which are available in frequent lengths is given. This is particularly important in the area of longer codes. The codes are a form of combined sequence and, hence, have the desirable property of bandwidth reduction for the outer code. However, only two member codes are required. A major usage of these codes may be in addressing."
"The problem of estimating radar range derivatives using phase differences is considered. A minimum-variance, unbiased estimator is obtained. The resultant variances of the estimates so obtained are shown to be significantly lower than those of a least-squares estimator. Finally, a recursive form for the estimator is derived."

 "The problem of measuring a constant phase difference between two sinusoids which have been corrupted by two additive noise processes is investigated. For the case in which both noise processes are Gaussian and the signal-to-noise ratio is high, the variance of the time-averaged phase-difference estimate is found as a single integral over the noise power spectral densities and cross spectral density. Arbitrary cross correlation is allowed between the two noise processes. Two cases of practical interest are considered: 1) the noise processes have identical, rectangular power spectral densities and are statistically independent; 2) an idealized radio direction finding situation in which two spatially separated sensors are immersed in an isotropic, planar noise field. For the statistically independent case, a universal curve is presented which permits determination of phase-estimate standard deviation for arbitrary signal-to-noise ratio and for a wide range of bandwidths and integration times."
"A two-dimensional matched filter technique is described for processing ing the signal from a pulsed coherent troposcatter link to obtain high crosspath resolution \"maps\" showing the relative positions of individual scatterers. For a typical tropolink (station displacement 200 km; midpath beam halfwidth 2 km; wavelength 0.3 meters) crosspath resolution is about 4.5 meters under perfect conditions. Vertical resolution is inversely proportional to scatterer height, but even for wide bandwidth signals is never better than hundreds of meters. Slight velocity mismatches between the signal and filter degrade crosspath resolution considerably so that the scatterers' velocity must be known accurately a priori. Crosspath resolution is relatively insensitive to mismatch in signal and filter record lengths. Random fluctuations of the velocity of a scatterer seriously degrade crosspath resolution. For the typical tropolink parameters and with a 10 m/s scatterer crosspath velocity and a 0.2 m/s standard deviation ion fluctuation the crosspath resolution degrades by an order of magnitude. It is concluded that the matched filter imaging scheme will produce images of individual scatterers if specific atmospheric conditions ions exist. The best results are obtained if the received signal comes from a single scattering layer at a known height, with scatterers moving at a known constant horizontal velocity, with no along-path or vertical components. Such a layer would be observed during night time or early morning when convective and mixing processes are at a minimum."
"This paper presents a target identification method based on an estimation of the natural frequencies of oscillation in transient radar signatures. The emphasis is placed upon signal modeling and estimation ation strategy rather than relating resonance locations to physical structures. Salient features of this identification method are: 1) target aspect angle is not needed, 2) multiple targets of the same type can be illuminated simultaneously, and 3) bandpass interrogation ion pulses can be used. The latter feature is compatible with existing radar facilities. The method is applied to some simulated transfer functions, and factors affecting estimate accuracy are discussed."
"This paper considers the use of sensitivity and error analysis algorithms for combined estimation and control systems to conduct trade-off studies for sensor equipment packages for a simple longitudinal inal motion VTOL hover controller. Simulation results indicate that in many problems the extra effort expended in model identification ation is justified in order to reduce the sensitivity of the system performance to implementation tolerances. The results of the hover controller design problem demonstrate the use of the algorithms as an aid in design decision making."
"The effect of I F filter bandwidth to I F frequency ratio on the probability of error in a binary bandpass communication system with nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) and split-phase (SP) signals is investigated. ed. Explicit results are given for the case when the bandpas I F filter is transformed from a single-pole low-pass filter."
"four widely used self-oscillating dc-to-square-wave parallel inverters which employ an inductor-capacitor tuned network to determine the oscillation frequency are reduced to a common equivalent RLC network. The techniques of singular-point analysis and state-plane interpretations are employed to describe the steady-state and transient ient behavior of these circuits and to elucidate the three possible modes of operation: quasi-harmonic, relaxation, and discontinuous. Design guidelines are provided through a study of the influence of circuit parameter variations on the characteristics of oscillation and on frequency stability. Several examples are provided to illustrate the usefulness of this analysis when studying such problems as transistor emitter-to-base junction breakdown during oscillations and the design of starting circuits to insure self-excited oscillations in these inverters."
"False lock occurs in Costas demodulators with sweep frequency acquisition because sideband energy is detected in the data channel. It is shown that utilizing the data and error channels to make the lock decision will prevent false lock from occurring."
"Useful new properties are obtained with a coherent pulse-burst waveform if the FM slopes are allowed to change from pulse to pulse. A design feature using such a \"slope-coded\" waveform is the ability to transfer, in a controllable manner, ambiguity volume from the range ambiguity peaks to regions located between the peaks (in the frequency direction). Slope coding thus provides a useful mechanism for matching the waveform to the environment; i. e., it permits the signal designer to make some compromise between range ambiguity-peak heights and low-velocity clutter rejection."
"The worst error performance of estimation filters is investigated for continuous systems in this paper. The pathological performance study, without assuming any dynamical model such as Markov processes for perturbations, except for its bounded amplitude, will give practical and dependable criteria in establishing the navigation and maneuver strategy in deep space missions."
"An extended Kalman filter is used to process line-of-sight measurements to stars and known landmarks providing a statistical indication of performance in estimating spacecraft attitude, orbital ephemeris, and the bias drift of a set of three strapdown gyros. The landmark measurements were assumed to have been taken from the imagery of an Earth-observing multispectral scanner. It is shown that filtering of these noisy measurements results in highly accurate estimates of the above parameters. Results are given showing the sensitivity of performance to various system parameters such as star tracker accuracy, errors in the knowledge of landmark position, and number of stars and landmarks processed."
"This paper considers the detection of a known constant signal in an additive non-Gaussian noise under the assumptions of discrete time and statistically independent noise samples. The objective is to determine how large sample size must be before the easily computed asymptotic relative efficiency becomes a valid measure of performance. The exact small-sample error probabilities are calculated for a Neyman-Pearson optimal nonlinear detector consisting of a zeromemory nonlinearity followed by summation and threshold comparison. \"Large-tailed\" noise having a double exponential distribution is used as an example. The exact distribution of the test statistics for a linear detector and for the Neyman-Pearson optimal detector are calculated. Then the relative efficiency of the Neyman-Pearson optimal detector, as compared to a linear detector, is computed in order to study the rate of approach of the relative efficiency to its asymptotic value."
"Phase-locked-loop (PLL) bit synchronizers often employ integrate-and-dump type phase detectors that provide phase error information only at discrete points in time. Usually these phase detectors are followed by sample-and-hold circuits to produce a stairstep error voltage as the input to a standard analog circuit loop filter. When the loop is configured in this manner, it is referred to as a hybrid PLL. Sampled-data analysis methods (Z transforms) are used to determine the stability and transient response of this loop."
"There is a problem in deciding whether a radar observation of an object in outer space is of a known catalogued satellite or of a newly launched satellite. With some radar systems joint or dumbell radar images of two satellites cause occasional confusion, and appropriate decision theory for this situation is derived. Decision theory for the individual image is given in an appendix."
"A computationally efficient scheme for forming a bank of identical contiguous rectangular digital filters is described. The data processing is organized in a sequential form allowing use of the FFT algorithm as the first stage. An example is given in which a bank of 256 rectangular filters is formed using only a few percent of the number of complex multiplies required by straightforward procedures. The steepness of cutoff is unaltered and the inband ripple is only slightly affected, but the sidelobe level suffers some degradation."
"The probability of detection and false-alarm rates are developed for laser radar systems perturbed by background radiation, fluctuating targets, and atmospheric turbulence. In particular, some results on the decibel loss due to atmospheric turbulence are presented."
"It recently has been shown in the literature that many dc-to-squarewave parallel inverters which are widely used in power-conditioning applications can be grouped into one of two families. Each family is characterized by an equivalent RLC network. Based on this approach, a classification procedure is presented for self-oscillating parallel inverters which makes evident natural relationships which exist between various inverter configurations. By utilizing concepts from the basic theory of negative resistance oscillators and the principle of duality as applied to nonlinear networks, a chain of relationships is established which enables a methodical transfer of knowledge gained about one family of inverters to any of the other families in the classification array."
"One of the most important objectives of a radar angle-tracking loop is to keep the target within the beamwidth of the radar antenna. Thus, the behavior of the antenna pointing error is of vital interest in determination of tracking performance. For a tracker with a general polynomial linearity (representing nonlinear receiver characteristics), subjected to constant line-of-sight rate inputs, random initial antenna pointing errors, and white Gaussian receiver noise, a method to obtain approximations to the transient mean and variance of the antenna pointing error as explicit functions of time is presented."
"The result of an investigation of the effects of pulse shape and duty cycle on the probability of error are presented for a pulse-gated binary modulation (PGBM) laser communication system when the background irradiance has the important Lorentzian spectral shape."
  "This correspondence deals with the effect of multiple signals on the control voltage of the delay-lock discriminator (tracker). Given n returned signals with known delay and power, a formula for the tracker estimate is derived. The analysis has specific application to low-altitude altimeters where the leak signal from the transmitter to the receiver may have delay comparable to the delay of the true signal."
"A direction-finding technique is presented that is capable of simultaneously estimating the arrival angles of multiple signals. Pulsed as well as continuous signals can be handled with the signal form only approximately specified. An adaptive antenna array is used as a processing device in the estimation technique. The effect of input signal and feedback loop parameters upon estimate bias is discussed."

 "A two-dimensional numerical analysis of the cross section of a homopolar inductor alternator supplying a rectifier load is developed. Besides the effects of the nonlinearities of the magnetic materials, the eddy currents induced in the rotor by the nonlinear load are considered. Results for a 95-kVA homopolar inductor alternator are presented and include magnetic induction and flux distribution at two instants of time, output voltage, eddy current densities, and loss. The theoretical results have been found to be in good agreement with available test data on the alternator."
"The results of a theoretical investigation of the influence of polarization on multipath are presented. First, the case of a point target is examined and it is confirmed that the multipath effect tends to vanish for rough sea and small grazing angles. Models of a buoy and of a large ship are then introduced and it is shown that, for targets that are extended in height, the multipath effect for vertical and horizontal polarization is substantially the same."
"A technique used in the flight control industry for estimation when combining measurements is the complementary filter. This filter is usually designed without any reference to Wiener or Kalman filters, although it is related to them. This paper, which is mainly tutorial, reviews complementary filtering and shows its relationship to Kalman and Wiener filtering."
"This is a summary paper describing the processing of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data using digital correlation algorithms. Fundamental SAR theory as it applies to the various SAR modes, namely, strip mapping, spotlight mapping, and Doppler beam sharpened mapping, is described and a baseline design applicable to all SAR modes is presented. Digital processor design is developed, starting with a simple single filter mechanization and proceeding through more complex processing algorithms. Prefilter design is discussed, as is the more advanced processing algorithms, namely, multiple parallel prefilters, two-stage correlation, and FFT processing. The primary processor tradeoff is increased functional complexity versus reduced arithmetic and memory requirements. For high-resolution applications, the arithmetic requirements can be reduced by an order of magnitude or more by implementing the more advanced processing algorithms."
"A generalized motion compensation approach applicable to all SAR modes, i.e., strip mapping (side-looking or squint), spotlight (or telescope) mapping, and Doppler beam sharpened mapping (DBS), is described. The basic concept is the formation for unit vector ū and the slaving of the real illuminating antenna and the processed synthetic antenna to this unit vector. The amount of motion compensation which is required is developed in terms of transfer curves for the main motion reduction paths, i.e., translational, rotational (lever arm), and real antenna stabilization. The transfer curves are obtained by dividing the expected motion spectrum by the required sensitivity spectrum. The most critical motion reduction path for typical parameters is shown to be the translational path. The lever arm and real antenna stabilization paths are less critical, but must also be implemented."
"The application of two-degree-of-freedom inertial sensors in a minimally redundant strapdown configuration is considered. The potential improvement in reliability which can be achieved by exploiting the failure isolation capability unique to this configuration is evaluated. A unified, statistical approach to the detection and isolation of both hard and soft sensor failures is presented. The effectiveness of this unified approach to FDI in terms of the mean time to detection, the mean time between false alarms, and the accumulated attitude error prior to detection is indicated by simulation results."

"A concept for adaptive directional filtering in a Nyquist rate scanned array based on time-domain sampling in the array sum channel is presented. By this method the adaptation rate may be independent of the scan rate in contrast to arrays with adaptive weight setting in the array element channels."
"Two classes of coherent radar types are analyzed to ascertain whether any significant advantages exist for a given system. The classes compared are those coherent radars which transmit a phasecoherent pulse-to-pulse RF carrier as opposed to those which transmit randomly phased RF carriers but store the coherent information at the radar for Doppler extraction. Rigorous new analytical development is avoided in favor of examination of the considerable existing literature, examination of practical limitations, and synthesis of generic solutions from key concepts. Examination is made of coherent radar classes from the viewpoints of reconnaissance ance and intelligence measurement, new radar design and devlopment, and electronic countermeasures vulnerability. The conclusion that the classes of coherent radars examined have a priori and a posteriori equivalent performance has significant implications not published in any reference source."
"Optimal detection of rectangular pulses in noise is considered, subject to a sidelobe constraint which ensures adequate resolution capabilities, and a new sidelobe reduction filter is derived. Tests in the laboratory and on a Westinghouse AN/TPS-27 search radar system em indicate that use of the new filter substantially improves both resolution and clutter performance over such standard techniques as fast time constant (FTC), delay line differentiator (DLD), and pulse length discriminator (PLD)."
"With the availability of modern data processing techniques and lowcost stable time references, the use of Loran in a direct-ranging mode offers certain potential advantages. In order to generate reliable direct-ranging Loran (DRL) performance projections and system designs, however, accurate system error models are required. This paper first describes the processing of airborne flight data from a DRL receiver to identify models for significant DRL system errors. These models are then used in a Kalman filter covariance simulation to generate performance predictions for an optimally integrated DRL system. Comparisons with conventional hyperbolic Loran are also given. DRL is shown to be capable of substantially improved position accuracy over that of conventional hyperbolic Loran, especially in regions of poor geometry. A stationary ground-align technique for improving DRL performance is also discussed."
"In this paper, a pulse torquing loop of a force integrating type sensor is investigated with the aim of increasing the measurement accuracy by choosing the proper design parameters, viz., sampling frequency and deadband. From the results, it is advisable to employ as high a sampling frequency as possible, while further improvements in performance can be obtained by operating the system in ternary mode with a deadband value, approximately equal to half the quantized output."
"This paper analyzes a sequential feedback detection scheme derived by Kramer's nonsequential intermittent one; in addition to the noiseless information feedback channel, it makes use of a noiseless decision feedback channel. Expressions for the normalized average evergy per symbol, average decision time, probability of error, and average power are derived. The comparison with the nonsequential intermittent scheme shows that the proposed one allows an appreciable gain in transmission rate and requires a smaller peak-to-average power ratio."
"The use of a Kalman filter in an applications problem requires a detailed model of both the system dynamics and the measurement dynamics. The model for many problems may be extremely large in dimensionality. However, in many instances one has a limited computer capability and, thus, must purposely introduce modeling errors into the filter in order to gain a computational advantage. However, as is well known, this may lead to the phenomenon of filter divergence. This paper considers the development of equations which allow one to evaluate a filter of reduced state. The equations are based upon using covariance analysis techniques in order to determine the true root-mean-square estimation error. These equations are computationally more advantageous than others appearing in the literature."
"This correspondence considers the problem of optimally controlling the thrust steering angle of an ion-propelled spaceship so as to effect a minimum time coplanar orbit transfer from the mean orbital distance of Earth to mean Martian and Venusian orbital distances. This problem has been modelled as a free terminal time-optimal control problem with unbounded control variable and with state variable equality constraints at the final time. The problem has been solved by the penalty function approach, using the conjugate gradient algorithm. In general, the optimal solution shows a significant departure from earlier work. In particular, the optimal control in the case of Earth-Mars orbit transfer, during the initial phase of the spaceship's flight, is found to be negative, resulting in the motion of the spaceship within the Earth's orbit for a significant fraction of the total optimized orbit transfer time. Such a feature exhibited by the optimal solution has not been reported at all by earlier investigators of this problem."
"A proportional boresight-error measurement is described for tracking systems that is applicable to envelope-producing matched filters with hard-limited inputs. The error response is derived as a function of input SNR and the filter output SNR is estimated."
"The acquisition problem for binary delay-lock loops is re-examined. Previous results obtained by Spilker and Gill on the maximum allowable search rate are shown to be in error. New results are given for the 2-Δ loop with video correlation and the 1-Δ loop with video and envelope correlation."

 "A cumulative index of IRE/IEEE papers on radar subjects was published in IEEE Trans. Aerospace and Electronic Systems in 1972 and updated in 1973. Since that time, the index has been expanded to cover textbooks and most of the US. and European journals in which radar papers are published, and to cover papers through December 1974. The subject classifications of the 1972 index have been retained, with a few modifications. The subjects Waveforms and Pulse Compression have been merged into Signal Design, with subclassifications: General, FM, Phase Code, and Pulse Bursts and Trains. Papers in the areas ofAntennas, Arrays, and Detection have been divided into several subclassifications. Multipath and Multiple Targets have been combined with Resolution, and new subjects on CFAR and OH Radar have been added. Material on Ranging has been placed under Measurement or under Signal Processing, and Three-D Radar has been merged with Search Radar. The journals indexed and abbreviations for them are given. Many related papers, not listed here, can be found by reference to two cumulative indexes ofIEEE Transactions: the AES Twenty-Year Index, (IEEE Trans.

 "A direct stochastic sensitivity analysis algorithm is developed for linear dynamical systems having incompletely known input statistics. The new algorithm extends previous results by applying covariance propagation concepts which utilize as a forcing function the sensitivity covariance matrix associated with the uncertainty in the elements of the system input covariance matrix itself. The developed algorithm is evaluated in the context of a generalized sensitivity analysis formulation involving nonlinear transformations on the input signals. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the new algorithm."
"It is shown by use of D.A. Huffman's polynomial representation for a finite sequence of contiguous pulses in a pulse train that Barker's binary-coded sequences can be modified, by a weighting of pulse amplitudes, to a condition where time sidelobes in the pulse compressed signal are substantially reduced. In such a pulse amplitude modification there is a sacrifice in pulse train energy since each pulse does not have maximum energy. Results here are provided for Barker's sequence of length 13 only."
"An attitude normalization scheme, based on quaternion updates' of the attitude matrix in a strapdown system, is presented which is optimal in the two-norm sense. Furthermore, the algorithm requires minimal computer time and memory load."
"Error equations for inertial navigation systems are derived using a perturbation (or true frame) approach and a psi angle (or computer frame) approach in a manner which shows the underlying as sumptions and allows direct comparison of the two methods. The comparison is general since the analysis is not associated with any particular mechanization. Different definitions of velocity errors and misalignment angles result from the two methods of error analysis, and, consequently, have significance in testing and analysis of pure-inertial systems, Doppler-inertial systems, and inertially aided weapon delivery systems. Examples and numerical results are presented for a local-level north-pointing mechanization."
"This paper describes studies of the TETAC system (Teaching Equipment for Telegraph Technology Aided by Computer). The system has been developed for training students at the University of Electro-Communications. TETAC is an intelligent system which recognizes Morse code sent by hand and converts it to letters by means of online and real-time processing. In addition, the system evaluates the qualities of trainees' keying operations; namely, it identifies the students' faults or tendencies. Although TETAC is now in the testing stage, we are confident of the effectiveness of the training and of TETAC's usefulness in modernizing a maritime communication system."
"A scheme for automatically detecting incipient failures in the feedback sensors (or instruments) of control systems is described. The feasibility of the scheme is investigated by applying it to a simplified version (fourth order) of the flight control system for a hydrofoil boat. A single set of inertial instruments is used to provide the feedback signals; the redundancy which is normally obtained by multiple instrument sets is obtained here, artificially, by a subsystem of multiple Luenberger observers and logic circuits. Tests indicate that scale factor errors, errors due to threshold effects, and bias errors in the instruments are detected as they occur. The tests also indicate further analytical work which should be done to explore the limitations of the basic scheme."
"The defruiter that is employed in the Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS) to prefilter asynchronous replies has a complex impact on the detection, estimation and validation properties of the detection subsystem. Its positive and negative effects are quantitatively enumerated via a simulation of the beacon processing subsystem of the Automated Radar Terminal System (ARTS III). It is concluded that the disadvantages of using the present-day defruiter in the ARTS III digital processing channel outweigh the advantages when fruit rates are below several thousand per scan. As an alternative to the total elimination of the defruiter a more general class of preprocessors is defined and their input-output relationships are derived using a Markov Chain formulation. These are found to represent an improvement over the current defruiter in that the positive effects of defruiting are retained while some of the negative effects are reduced."
"An experimental program is described that had the objective of measuring the effects of the time-dependent structure of downlink (air craft to ground) interference generated by the Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS) in an active air traffic terminal area that are relevant to system and ground controller response time. The results of this program indicate a number of interesting details concerning the correlation of the level of the downlink interference with changes in the arrival and departure rates of aircraft at the local terminal sites."
"Maxwell's equations govern the eddy-current phenomenon, and are the starting point of this analysis. It is shown that Maxwell's equations, as applied to steady-state ac conditions, can be transformed to a Fredholm-type integral equation in eddy-current density. In turn, it is demonstrated that the method of subareas can be used to solve the Fredholm equation. This approach leads to the familiar circuit-analysis concepts of resistance and inductance in finite coupled circuits. The coupledcircuit method can be utilized in cases of complex, mixed boundary conditions without difficulty, as is illustrated by an example of the eddy-current losses in a conducting disk of finite thickness and finite radius, in the presence of a current-carrying loop. Experimental data is presented which confirms the theory, for a range of disk thicknesses. References are included to previous work."
"This paper reviews a large number of silicon solar cell irradiation experiments performed over the last 10 years, including 1-MeV and energy spectrum electron studies, and low-(100-keV) and high-energy (up to 155-MeV) proton studies on bare and covered silicon solar cells of several types. The results of satellite flight experiments on individual solar cells are also presented, as well as data from complete solar arrays and data on the new high-efficiency solar cells. Experimental evidence indicates that the percentage of degradation is smaller in thin solar cells than in thick ones, and that cells with high resistivity (10 Ω·cm) degrade less than cells with lower resistivity (1 Ω·cm). It is shown that high-efficiency silicon solar cells produced at COMSAT Laboratories and pilot production groups of these cells retain most of their increased power output under irradiation. It is emphasized that all surfaces and edges of the solar cells must be completely shielded from the large flux protons in the space environment. Insufficiencies in the published data are noted in certain areas, and recommendations for additional research are presented. Finally, an extensive bibliography is included."
"This paper analyzes the operation of a phase-locked loop (PLL) preceded by a bandpass limiter (BPL) in the presence of impulsive noise. It is shown that the effect of the limiter consists essentially in a change of the statistics of the pulse strengths of the noise, so that the behavior of a BPL + PLL can be deduced from that of a simple PLL by suitable adjustment of the noise model. It is found that the limiter greatly enhances the PLL performance by reducing both the phase-error variance in the loop and the probability of cycle slippage. Finally, the design of the filter of the BPL is discussed, resulting in the conclusion that the best results are obtained by using a singletuned RLC circuit."
"Doppler processors are used in radar to separate target returns from clutter. When the clutter is at a range farther than the unambiguous range of the radar, the ability to reject the clutter is degraded. In this article the degradation is analyzed for an N-pulse batch processor with Dolph weighting, and the results show how degradation varies with design sidelobe level."
"Two jet fighter models, 1/8th of original size, have been measured in the \"radar range\" installed in the anechoic chamber of the Armament Technology and Procurement Group in Berne. The measurements have been made at a frequency of 40 GHz (5 GHz for full scale), with an accuracy of ± 2 dB and a dynamic range of 80 dB. The statistical distribution of the radar cross section has been calculated with the help of a computer, based on the measured data. The detection probability has been calculated with the help of a correlation procedure. This procedure allows explanation of the symmetry relation between the detection probability and the cumulative distribution of the radar cross section, and of a well-known characteristic of the median value of the radar cross section. A statistical model is proposed for the distribution of the radar cross section of jet fighters, consisting of the distribution of a spheroid in which each element itself exhibits a Rayleigh fluctuation. This model presents a certain number of interesting characteristics, and there is an acceptable degree of coincidence with the measured values."
"This paper discusses the performance and sensitivity of a maximum-likelihood length estimation algorithm which was originally developed to estimate the separation between unresolved point scatterers. It shows that when the two-scatterer target model is valid, the algorithm reliably estimates lengths shorter than the Rayleigh limit provided that the strength of no third interior scatterer (or its equivalent created by a few very closely spaced scatterers) is greater than the geometric mean of the strengths of the fore and aft scatterers."
"Boresight correction on detected but unlocated targets may be made if a bearing (whose error is unknown) is repeated on two seeker headings and another bearing is repeated on two seeker headings, or if bearing is repeated on three seeker headings. The assumption is made that seeker position and heading are known. The procedure is effective either with the above or with the combination of restricted seeker travel and intermittent target detection."
"This paper reviews various electric generation schemes for wind energy conversion suitable for interconnection with a power grid. The schemes can be generally classified as constant speed constant frequency (CSCF) and variable speed constant frequency (VSCF) systems. Historically, only CSCF systems have been used for large power generation in wind power plants. However, with the advent of power electronics and the availability of solid state devices capable of handling large amounts of power, VSCF systems are becoming competitive. Various schemes under each classification are discussed and compared. It is stressed, however, that the optimum choice of the generating scheme is not decided by considering the generator alone. The optimum choice is one which minimizes the cost of energy generated by the wind power plant."
"The Kalman filtering technique can be used to improve estimates of angular velocity (in a strapped-down navigation system) using angular increment (rate integral) data. A simple, second-order, constant coefficient digital filter can yield significant improvement for a very high or a very low noise-to-signal ratio·r = 4 σθ /σ α T2, where σ θ is the rms noise in measuring angular increments, σ α is the rms angular acceleration, and T is the sampling time. For r ≈ 1, the filter affords negligible performance improvement."
"In synthetic aperture radar a large linear phased array is formed from the rapid movement of a single element through each position in the array. Storage and coherent combining of the successive radar echoes are central to the array-forming process. Optical processing is the most common technique because of the efficiency with which Fourier transformation may be accomplished with simple optics. Real-time operation, however, requires all-electronic processing, which is difficult to accomplish because of the huge quantity of data to be manipulated. Dynamic range compression by hard limiting may ease the problem by reducing the number of bits per frame. The effects of hard limiting are analyzed in this paper. It is shown that large targets simultaneously illuminated by the radar antenna will produce image targets or ghosts displaced in angle. Statistically homogeneous clutter will \"linearize\" the hard-limited receiver and suppress the ghosts without loss in contrast, as does thermal noise if it is larger than the target echoes. Pulse compression reduces the probability of images from prominent targets. Judicious choice of the pulse-compression waveform is a powerful tool for destroying coherent buildup of images from all large targets not in the same range resolution cell. Linear FM, the most common choice, unfortunately does not exhibit this desirable property."
"Advances in the analysis and design of low-frequency radio navigation systems are presented in four sections detailing system design, propagation, receivers and processors, and error analyses. Emphasis is on the short-baseline case where radial accuracies of 114 feet are possible for non-line-of-sight operation to ranges of 50 miles from transmitters. Possibel future applications for LF include an efficient solution for commercial ground transportation management, remotely piloted vehicle navigation, and cruise missile guidance. An error budget and experimental results are included plus a countermeasures analysis."
"Theoretical results are presented on probability of error in the detection of binary FM signals for various frequency deviations with fixed bit rate, restricted predetection filter bandwidth, ideal limiterdiscriminator reception, and integrate-and-dump postdetection filter decision. The results show that suboptimal system performance can be achieved by choosing the largest possible value of deviation index which lies approximately at 0.7 + 2n, where n = 0, 1,...,k. k is determined by the reconstructability of signal after the bandpass filter."
"A system is developed to detect tracks crossing two-dimensional noise fields. This is accomplished by filtering and integration of signal power in the frequency domain of a new class of generalized transforms which include the FFT and FBT as limiting forms. If the track is essentially parallel to a transform axis and if filters are derived from hard-limited linear approximations to tracks, the FBT offers considerable hardware economy over the FFT in the mechanization algorithm."
"In this paper the dependence of the threshold CNR of a simple phaselocked demodulator on the frequency deviation of an FM signal has been evaluated by the concept of quasi-stationary approximation. Experimental findings have been presented in support of the theoretical conclusion."
"The use of Doppler radar measurements to provide velocity damping for an aircraft inertial navigation system is considered. Three different Doppler antenna configurations are examined: two-axis stabilized, azimuth stabilized, and data stabilized antennas. A general reference velocity error equation is presented and appropriately evaluated for each of the Doppler configurations. Specific elements of the error equations are examined and physically interpreted for both local-level and space-stable inertial systems. Detailed examination of the interaction of Doppler radar and inertial navigation velocity error mechanisms is provided."
"A sensor array is treated as a spatial filter in rejecting undesired signals. The array is governed by a control law derived from the noise covariance matrix supplied by the time-varying noise field in an optimal fashion. Signal-to-noise ratio is used as the optimality criterion. The optimal control law is self-adjusted by a simple adaptive scheme. The adaptive scheme is computationally efficient due to a fast matrix inversion formula. The adaptor is stable and is independent of initial condition for sufficiently long operating periods."
"This paper treats the problem of estimating a signal corrupted by noise that is sampled and quantized at a high data rate. Local and global processors are proposed to achieve data compression that permits near optimal extraction of information. Two techniquesmaximum likelihood and minimum transform chi square, which are in the class of best asymptotically normal estimators- are investigated for the local processor. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach."
"In view of the fact that the Frank-Hiemiller (FH) signal has the property that its periodic autocorrelation is zero, it is desirable to generate multiple FH signals for possible use in a multiple-signal environment and, in particular, in multiple-access communication systems. These multiple FH signals are generated by transformation of an FH matrix whose consecutive rows describe an FH signal. The periodic and nonperiodic autocorrelation and cross correlation of the multiple FH signals are derived, and it is shown that the periodic autocorrelation of multiple FH signals preserves the ideal properties of FH signals and nonperiodic cross correlation is bounded by 1/sin (n/π), where n is the number of phases. In this context, a formula for nonperiodic autocorrelation for FH signals is derived and plots of the autocorrelation of FH signals of length 81 100 and 121 are given. The bound derived for the periodic and nonperiodic cross correlation is applied to find the performance of multiple-access spread-spectrum satellite communications."
"The optimum processing is found to detect a signal sequence in a set of M \"images\" with a common background; the \"images\" are the final counts, after a fixed reception time, for each of J spatially separate detectors and for each of M separate receptions. The spatially varying background is assumed either unknown or normal with known mean and covariance; results are generally confined to the device noise limited case. It is shown that, unlike the classical case, optimum signal selection, along with optimum processing, can not entirely eliminate the detectability loss due to the background."
"The spectrum of a digital FM signal can be considered as an indicator of the resistance of the signal to distortions caused by band limitation. The study in this paper is oriented toward the design of signaling pulses that will achieve an FM signal spectrum concentrated about the carrier frequency. Convenient spectrum expressions and general guarantees of optimality are found for binary FSK signals."
"Some simple formulas of Blachman giving the zero-frequency spectral density of phase rate for narrowband Gaussian random noise in terms of the latter's spectral radius of gyration are used to derive the zero-frequency spectral density of radar glint for a complex target in terms of the radius of gyration of the collection of radar scatterers and the rate of zero crossings of the target echo."
"A result of Morinaga et al. [6] for the autocorrelation function of phase rate of narrowband Gaussian noise when averaged over accompanying wideband Gaussian noise is used to derive the power specturm of inherent glint and, thereby, its variance for a frequency-agile radar assuming Gaussian random angular motion of a complex target. The zero-frequency spectral density of inherent glint is shown to be -9.8 dB relative to that for a fixed-frequency radar under similar conditions. This result is not sensitive to the product of the agility bandwidth and the radial target extent, provided this product is adquate (as is normally ensured by current design practice for given target types). The associated glint variance with adequate agility bandwidth is shown to be 0.142 ϒ20, where ϒo is the relevant radius of gyration of the collection of radar scatterers comprising the target. A theoretical relation due to Durrani and Greated [8], derived in another context, indicates that the wideband echo spectrum resulting from frequency agility needs, in fact, to have a bandwidth of the order of 103 times that of the narrowband echo spectrum associated with target angular motion to achieve the above 9.8-dB improvement factor. For the lesser bandwidth ratios of 102 and 10, the indicated improvement factors fall to 9.4 dB and 6.5 dB, respectively."
"This correspondence gives a method of selecting n features out of k (n < k) FFT filter outputs which characterize them classes of target signatures to be recognized. The method differs from other known techniques in that it uses a priori information of the target measurements. It is based on an error bound established by Lainiotis which is a weighted sum of Bhattacharyya coefficients."
"This correspondence considers the duality of linear estimation and control with constraints for discrete time systems. By using Bellman's principle of optimality, two important problems in estimation-namely, constrained energy and multiplicative noise-are shown to be duals of linear regulator problems with constraints on the control and states, respectively, with boundary conditions specified at opposite ends of the extremals in time. Algorithms are presented to establish the duality concept."
"The claims made by Grasshoff in his recent comment on the spinning stabilizer are only heuristic in nature and the claims are found to be in error because the body of dual-spin stabilization theory developed during the past decade and on which Grasshoff's main defence is based was proved to be erroneous."
"Formulas for detection performance are derived for a noncoherent radar system that has orthogonally polarized receiving channels and uses linear video addition. The background is assumed to be Gaussian noise, and Swerling I and 11 target models are considered."
"In the experimental ground station for a synchronized discrete-address beacon system (Synchro-DABS) a timing count for transmitting the synchronizing interrogation is generated by a single subtraction which also removes system delays. Effects of aircraft motion are removed by paired interrogations."
"The effect of front-end jitter in a previously proposed sequential feedback scheme for binary signals detection is considered [1]. The presence of this type of multiplicative Gaussian noise in addition to additive Gaussian noise results in an \"effective\" additive Gaussian noise so that system performances are easily obtained from previous considerations."
"A bit synchronizer for pulse-code modulated signals using a minicomputer is described. lt is a real-time system suitable for low bit rates and it extracts bit information even when the bit width is varying. Its performance in the presence of Gaussian noise is presentld."
"A CW signal at frequency f1 can be translated to frequency f2 by adding equal phase steps of size B cycles at a uniform rate fm. The frequency shift f2 - f1 is Bfm. Spectrum components are produced at frequencies fn = f2 + nfm (n any integer>. Their normalized amplitudes are an = (sin πB)/π (B + n). This is a simpler result than one previously published, and less restricted with respect to values of B."
"Approximations to a square-law detector in digital signal processor implementations using quadrature channels result in a loss of detectability. Previous studies to determine this loss in several cases of practical interest are supplemented by an asymptotic analysis which applies when a large number of pulses are integrated. The results obtained show that the asymptotic loss due to the \"sum-of magnitudes\" detector, as compared to a square-law detector, is O.29 dB. Similarly, the asymptotic loss in a system which sums the magnitudes in a single channel (video MTI canceller) is 1.79 dB. For both of these results, it should be recalled, however, that even a perfect envelope detector is subject to an asymptotic loss of O.19 dB, as compared to the square-law detector."
"The relevance of the polarizability tensors in low-frequency scattering is discussed. Data are presented for a variety of perfectly conducting, rotationally symmetric bodies simulating simple aerospace objects, and it is shown how the presence of any coating influences the results."
     "Provides instructions and guidelines to prospective authors who wish to submit manuscripts."

"Provides a listing of current staff, committee members and society officers."
  "Sonar echo analysis that is not affected by relative motion between target, transmitter, and receiver is discussed. Motion-tolerant measurement and recognition of range-distributed targets involves: 1) a determination of the effects of range rate upon echoes from non-planar reflectors and 2) the derivation of a signal, filter bank, and target parameterization scheme that is insensitive to those effects. The appropriate system is derived, simulated with a computer, and tested with actual echoes from various targets. The system's signals and filters are very similar to those found in biological sonars."
"New techniques have been evolved for the application of Langmuir probes to the measurement of electron densities in the wakes of hypersonic projectiles flown in ballistic ranges. These techniques concern probe cleanliness, minimization of flow disturbance, minimization of reflected shocks, and the effect of plasma potential. Electron density level estimates obtained with the probes in sphere wakes were in good agreement with electron density estimates derived from simultaneous measurements with a microwave interferometer."
"In this paper a new monopluse technique for reducing radar multipath angle-tracking errors is proposed. The solution is achieved by using two monopulse antennas at different heights. The available signals allow one to control the antenna-height diversity so that the elevation angle control signal is not affected by reflected-wave components. The size of the antenna system may be reduced by properly using phase shifters. A possible configuration of such a system is considered and some practical data on the antenna-height diversity are discussed."
"High range-resolution monopulse (HRRM) tracking radar which maintains wide instantaneous bandwidth through both range and angle error sensing channels provides range, azimuth, elevation, and amplitude for each resolved part of the target. The three-dimensional target detail can be used to improve and extend radar performance in several ways: for improved precision of target location, for target classification and recognition, to counter repeater-type ECM, to improve low-angle multipath tracking, to resolve multiple targets, as a miss-distance measurement capability, and for improved tracking in chaff and clutter. These have been demonstrated qualitatively except for the ECCM to repeater ECM and low-altitude tracking improvement. Initial results from an experimental HRRM radar with 3-ns pulse length show resolution of aircraft into its major parts and precise location of each resolved part accurately in range and angle. Realtime closed-loop tracking is performed on aircraft in flight using high-speed sampled, digitized, and processed HRRM range and angle video data. Clutter rejection capability is also demonstrated."
"This paper considers the effects of noise and transmission delays in a phase-averaging mutual synchronization system. The basic analytical ideas are developed with respect to a two-station system which contains first-or second-order analog phase-lock loops. From the equation describing the phase error dynamics of each system, a generalized Fokker-Planck equation is derived. It is used to obtain a good approximate analytic expression for the phase error probability density function (PDF), which is confirmed by simulation. An important quantity for such mutual synchronization systems, under random disturbances, is the variance of the frequency deviation. This may be obtained directly from a knowledge of the phase error PDF. The above development is then extended to a mutual synchronization system of arbitrary size."
"A new class of staggered PRF MTI radar processors is developed in this paper. These processors are constrained to achieve a specified value of MTI improvement and, subject to this constraint, minimize variations in processor response as a function of target Doppler frequency. The selection of both filter weights and PRF stagger sequences is discussed and a number of representative designs are presented."
"The performance of various coherent MTI systems in the presence of white noise is investigated. The single-pulse signal-to-noise ratios at the output of the filters are presented for the case of large system bandwidth. Generalized results, calculated as a function of the system's bandwidth, are given. Finally, those results are compared to the optimum signal-to-noise acheivable by a matched filter."
"This paper presents an algorithm for a class of suitably constrained reduced-order filters which minimize the variance of the estimated variables. The algorithm generates both the filter gain history and the true estimation error covariance. The algorithm provides a quantitative criterion which can be used to measure the performance of any reduced-order estimator. Both continuous and discrete estimators are considered. Several examples are treated including an application of the technique to a hybrid navigation system of high order."
"Analysis of a typical amplitude-comparison monopulse angle-tracking radar shows that gain variation and bias in the radar error signal can occur under certain conditions involving multiple targets. The general behavior depends on the Doppler separation of the targets relative to system bandwidths; for a specific situation, the gain variation and bias are functions of the relative strengths of the targs. The analysis is shown to be consistent with experimental observations."
"This paper analyzes the performance of a number of modulation and speech processing techniques that have been considered for single voice channel per carrier transmissions via satellite. This transmission mode is applicable to demand assignment systems, which make possible the most efficient loading of the satellite transponder in applications where the traffic at individual Earth terminals is not sufficient to justify a substantial number of dedicated channels. The analysis basically determines the operating point for the satellite transponder which minimizes the required Earth terminal G/T. The fraction of the total link noise allocated to uplink noise is treated as a parameter, so that the cost of improving G/T may be traded against the cost of providing increased Earth terminal transmitter power. Both analog and digital modulation techniques are considered, together with various practical combinations of syllabic companding, voice-actuated carriers, and error-correcting codes. The results are presented in general analytic form, applicable to any modulation technique for which carrier-to-noise density ratio, channel width, and guardband width may be specified. Curves showing required G/T as a function of the total number of voice channels per transponder are also presented for the above-mentioned signal processing techniques, assuming \"CCIR/CITT type\" speech quality and transponder EIRP and bandwidth typical of current domestic satellite configurations."
 "Previous digital design experiences provide guidance and offer solutions for one of the newest digital technology applications: The commercial transport AFCS. In addition to facing well-documented problems of software control and maintainability, operational safety adds a new dimension to the requirements for software reliability. After a general discussion of the problems encountered in past digital system programs, this paper addresses the specific requirements of the commercial transport system and their implications in terms of system architecture and software development. An immproved solution to the problem of software design is offered, and its impact on traditional and future problem areas is outlined. A description of a prototype digital AFCS under development is presented. The experiences to date with this system reinforce the correctness of techniques and approaches used in its development."
"Functional partitioning, redundancy structure, internal communications, and software modularization define the architecture of a digital automatic flight control system (DAFCS). Selection of a suitable system architecture for commercial transports involves such factors as the functional scope, growth provision and flexibility requirements, sensor interfaces, the aircraft's actuator and control surface redundancy, and the dispatch reliability requirements. Trade-offs concerning these various factors are discussed, and it is shown that a very versatile and almost universal DAFCS can be configured to meet the general and peculiar needs associated with each aircraft application. Specific results associated with this system's recent demonstration flights in the DC-10 aircraft, as well as examples from several other transport aircraft applications of the same DAFCS architecture, are used to illustrate the design concepts."
"The availability of digital MSI and LSI has made digital flight control systems more cost effective than analog systems for all but the simplest systems. The organization of a digital flight control system is concerned not only with implementation of the control laws and associated logic but also with the management of the data used in these computations and the organization of the computation. The configuration taken by a digital flight control system is dominated by the integrity and data handling requirements. This paper considers the impact of these factors on the design and operation of digital flight control systems with particular emphasis on the use of fiber optics for transmission of data between lanes."
"In airline service the reliability of a system is more than the confirmed failures for the system; it is the total removal experience of the system. Thus, the reliability of a system lies not only in the piece part failure rates, but also in the capability to verify and isolate failures. The application of digital technology brings several significant reliability improvements to automatic flight control systems (AFCS) when compared to contemporary analog systems. These advantages are demonstrated by the experience of the digital air data computer (DADC) of the DC-10 and the digital AFCS of the JA-37 Viggen. Experience with this equipment is reviewed, and the results are interpreted in terms of projections for airline DAFCS reliability. The digital system built-in test implemented by a stored program and the central processor gives a system integrity and dispatch reliability unequaled by analog systems. This high-integrity self-test reduces removal rates by giving line personnel a trustworthy tool and more complete automatic test processes for verifying maintenance actions. Digital circuit technology is directly suitable to largescale integrated circuits (LSIC) which reduce piece part counts and improve LRU reliability. Digital circuits are less subject to drift and the attendant difficulty to detect failures. These factors, coupled with the inherent high-integrity self-test, provide the basis for a significant improvement in reliability by the use of a digital automatic flight control system."
"Beginning with process controls in the mid fifties, digital control systems have seldom met all the claimed advantages and in many cases have been outright failures. Airborne digital computers have just begun to appear in the commercial jet transport market after several years of experimental and military development. The success of these systems in meeting user expectations has not been overwhelming, which leads to the question: Why change from known analog flight control technology to digital? This paper examines that question by reviewing the state of the art in analog flight control system technology and evaluating this against current airline problems. A realistic means of evaluating claimed advantages for new technology is thus established. The advertised solutions of digital technology to analog problems are examined and, in some cases, debunked. However, consideration of the real problems and the capabilities of digital systems leads to the conclusion that there is a real payoff. Evidence from background studies at Boeing is offered to support this conclusion. A description of the digital flight control system electronics (FCSE) development program for the new Boeing 7×7 airplane is also provided. This program is currently in progress, and its specific objective is to assure that the real payoff is achieved for the subsequent production system."
"This paper begins with a review of the advantages of SSTs over subsonic aircraft for long-range travel in Russia. It then describes the navigation and control equipment used in the Russian SST. the TU-144. The reliability of this automatic navigation and control equipment (as well as other equipment) is increased through the use of redundant components. Weight, space, and serviceability requirements and their effect on equipment design are discussed."
  "The phase-sensitive noncoherent MTI detects targets by relative motion between the target and an extended clutter background. In this type of MTI, the phase of the target is compared with the phase of the clutter in an adjacent range bin. Theoretical analysis of the system's performance is presented. The improvement factors for single- and double-delay periodic filters are derived and computational results are included."
"A study is made of a transmitting antenna spinning relative to a receiving antenna, showing that the received signal undergoes a phase shift which depends upon the relative orientation and the ellipticity conditions of the two antennas. It is shown that this phase shift is important in Doppler distance measuring equipment because it must not be confused with the phase shift caused by the changing distance between the antennas."
"It is shown that when the gyro spin vector is in opposition to the spin vector of the vehicle, the output differential equation of the gyro becomes unstable for large vehicle spin values. When the gyro is used with its spin vector along the spin vector of the vehicle, the steady-state response of the gyro is a nonlinear function of the roll rate of the vehicle."
"The uniformly spaced burst waveform provides excellent clutter rejection in cases where the clutter and targets are separated in velocity. However, it has the major disadvantage that an object at one range (at or near the search velocity) will give returns up and down range from the search range. If a simple threshold detection scheme is used which decides that an object is present at a location when the return at the corresponding time crosses a threshold, then a single object will give rise to many detections. (We shall call the detections at the ranges other than the true range of the object ambiguous detections, or ambiguities.) There are two classes of techniques to remove these ambiguities: those operating with a single transmission and those requiring additional transmissions. This correspondence considers the coincidence detection procedure which requires the transmission of two bursts with different pulse spacings. The detection and ambiguity removal performance of this algorithm is considered in detail for the case of scintillating targets."
"A comparison of the structure and performance of two detectors for an array processing problem is discussed. The first is optimal for detection performance in the Bayesian sense and the second models a maximum-likelihood (beam-forming) approach. Of particular interest is the loss in performance due to nonoptimal processing."
"Complementary sequences are useful because when the autocorrelation functions of the member codes are algebraically added, the resultant peak-to-sidelobe ratio is theoretically infinite. Two major types of these sequences, called, respectively, the \"pure sense complementary sequences\" and the \"broad sense complementary sequences,\" exist. Both types are available in unlimited lengths. However, the lengths of both types are restricted to discrete values. This correspondence reports on another type of complementary sequence which offers the system designer trade-offs among the parameters of code lengths, numbers of member codes, bandwidths in the encoding and decoding networks, pulse width and, hence, resolution, PRF, etc."

  "The Applications Technology Satellite (ATS-6), the most powerful, most sophisticated, most versatile communications satellite flown to date, is the last of NASA's experimental satellites intended to demonstrate major advances in communications and spacecraft technology. It is a multipurpose, multidisciplinary spacecraft whose principal objectives were to demonstrate a large, unfurlable antenna structure and precise pointing and attitude control in the synchronous orbit The spacecraft carries 27 different experiments, 3 of which demonstrate users' applications of satellite communications. Significant advances in antenna technology, precise attitude control, materials technology, spacecraft structures, and thermal control have been successfully demonstrated. The most significant accomplishments of the ATS-6 mission are the demonstration of the practicality of satellite broadcasting to small, simple, inexpensive ground stations and the uses of this potential service in the solution of social problems involving education and health care. The success of these initial demonstrations has led ATS-6 experimenters and potential users to incorporate a Public Service Satellite Consortium dedicated to the provision of satellite broadcasting services for educational and health-care applications."
"The Applications Technology Satellite-6 (ATS-6) uses a 9l1-r parabolic antenna with high gain to enable communications with simple, low-cost ground stations with 3-m-diameter antennas. The structural system met all of its requirements, deployed properly, and preserved sensor alignment within 0.1 degree. The thermal control system has kept all temperatures within specified limits. The communications subsystem in-orbit performance has also exceeded specifications with high receiver gain-to-temperature ratios and high transmitter El RP. The spacecraft propulsion system performance has been within specifications. The near-perfect geosynchronous orbit achieved by the Titan IIIC resulted in a 8-kg fuel saving which should extend mission life. The attitude and control subsystem is providing the necessary stabilization and accurate slewing control. The electrical power subsystem provided 40 W more than the specified value at the last summer solstice. The telemetry and command subsystem performance has also been nominal."
"The ATS-6 is the most advanced experimental satellite that has evolved from the Application Technology Satellite Program conducted and implemented by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA/GSFC). This project utilizes a state-of-the-art spacecraft and ground terminal network to perform advance studies and to conduct technological demonstrations in a large number of scientific areas. The design and implementation of this unique spacecraft permitted multiple experimentation simultaneously. The control of the spacecraft is performed at ATS Operational Control Center (ATSOCC) located at NASA/GSFC. Experimentation which was performed covered a wide spectrum of communications, technological, meterorological, and scientific subjects. Three principal ground terminals are utilized to assist the experimenters to acquire data. Data reduction and analysis are performed by the many facilities at NASA/GSFC in support of the experimenters."
"The Health/Education Telecommunications (HET) Experiment involved six different experiments conducted under the auspices of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) with technical assistance from NASA. The HET Experiment on ATS-6 was operated and controlled from a network coordination center in Denver, Colo., which included a 4-and 6-GHz Earth station. The HET Experiment used remote Earth terminals with 3-m-diameter dishes having a 35 dB gain at 2.5 GHz. In addition, comprehensive terminals operating at both C-band and S-band were used for communications with Alaska. The total network involved a complex of satellite and land links at C-band, S-band, and very high frequency (VHF), using the ATS-1, ATS-3, and ATS-6 satellites. The network performance exceeded expectations with remote terminal operations exhibiting a peak-to-peak signal to weighted rms noise ratio of 49 dB at least 99 percent of the time. The remote site operators performed well and were well motivated although they had little previous technical experience."
"The Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE) is scheduled for the second year of satellite operation. Applications Technology Satellite (ATS-6) will receive C-band video signals frorn Abmedabad and Delhi, India, and will retransmitt the video and two audio sub-carriers at 860 MHz to 6 clusters of 400 direct-receive stations for a total of 2400 direct-receive stations. Morning programs of 1.5 hours per day are designed for classroom use, and evening programs of 2.5 hours duration are designed for village adult education. Indian production antennas and television sets have been tested and found to meet specifications, and a successful experiment is anticipated."
"The Television Relay Using Small Terminals (TRUST) Experiment was designed to advance and prornote the technology of broadcasting satellites. A constant envelope television FM signal was transmitted at C band to the ATS-6 Earth coverage hom and retransmitted at 860 MHz through the 9-m antenna to a low-cost direct-readout ground station. The experiment demonstrated that high-quality television and audio can be received by lowcost direct-receive ground stations. Predetection bandwidths significantly less than predicted by Carson's rule can be utilized with minimal degradation of either monochrome or color pictures. Two separate techniques of dual audio channel transmission have been demonstrated to be suitable for low-cost applications."
"Thr first radio tracking of one artificial satellite via another began on April 16, 1975. At that time the NASA Applications Technology Satellite6 (ATS-6) geostationary satellite began to relay both tracking and telemetry data from the near-Earth geodynamics satellite, Geos-3. This historic first was followed by the ATS-6 relay of data from the NASA weather satellite, Nimbus-6 launched on June 12, 1975. This paper presents the various experiment configurations, equipment descriptions, and results achieved to date with these satellite-to-satellite tracking and data relay experiments."
"The frequency band from 5.925 to 6.425 GHz is served by fixed satellites and by terrestrial microwave links. There is a possibility of microwave links pointed at the horizon causing interference to the uplinks of domestic and international communications satellites sharing the same frequency band. A mathematical model has been derived for predicting the fields at geostationary orbit based on the known characteristics and known distribution of the terrestrial microwave relay system. The Applications Technology Satellite-6 (ATS-6) is sensitive to signals in the range of 10 dBW radiated in the direction of the satellite. Signals in the range of 10-30 dBW have been recorded over various parts of the United States."
"The Applications Technology Satellite (ATS-6) Millimeter Wave Experiment, developed and implemented by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, has provided the first direct measurements of 20-and 30-GHz Earth-space links from an orbiting satellite. Studies at eleven locations in the continental United States were directed at an evaluation of rain attenuation effects, scintillations, depolarization, site diversity, coherence bandwidth, and analog and digital communications techniques In addition to direct measurements on the 20-and 30-GHz links, methods of attenuation prediction with radars, rain gauges, and radiometers were developed and compared with the directly measured attenuation. This paper presents a review of the major results of the first year of measurements with ATS-6, with emphasis on the impact of the measurements on millimeter wave space systems design."
"The 13/18-GHz COMSAT Propagation Experiment (CPE) is reviewed, the data acquisition and processing are discussed, and samples of preliminary results are presented. The need for measurements of both hydrometeor-induced attenuation statistics and diversity effectiveness is brought out The facilitation of the experiment-CPE dual frequency and diversity site location, the CPE ground transmit terminals, the CPE transponder on Applications Technology Satellite-6 (ATS-6), and the CPE receive and data acquisition system-is briefly examined. The on-line preprocessing of the received signal is reviewed, followed by a discussion of the off-line processing of this database to remove signal fluctuations not due to hydrometeors. Finally, samples of the results of first-level analysis of the resultant data for the 18-GHz diversity site near Boston, Mass., and for the dual frequency 13/18-GHz site near Detroit, Mich., are presented and discussed."
"The Geosynchronous Very High Resolution Radiometer (GVHRR), flown on the three-axis stabilized geosynchronous satellite, Applications Technology Satellite-6 (ATS-6), collected meteorological data for two months during the summer of 1974. Several hundred images were successfully taken. Data collection terminated when the instrument chopper motor failed. The instrument, its supporting ground equipment, and the data collected in orbit are described."
"The Radio Beacon Experiment is designed to measure the total electron content and ionospheric content between the satellite and any observer within its field of view. Since Applications Technology Satellite-6 (ATS-6) is visible from about 43 percent of the Earth's surface, an international community of observers have made measurements using it. The radio parameters have to be measured to an accuracy of a few percent, which requires good system calibration and stability. The spaceborne beacon transmits signals on frequencies of 40, 140, and 360 MHz with amplitude modulations of 1 MHz and/or 0.1 MHz for the measurement of modulation phase, Faraday rotation, and amplitude. The overall system objectives and requirements are discussed along with the design of the ATS-6 transmitter and the receiver in Boulder, Colo. The role of the principal investigator in the context of the international program is considered with particular reference to the joint National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Max Planck Institute (MPI) observation program. Monthly median hourly values of total content, plasmaspheric content, and shape factor show distinct diurnal and seasonal variations. A specific event is described to illustrate the use of a spaced receiver network."
"A summary of the design of the University of California at Los Angeles' fluxgate magnetometer is presented. Instrument noise in the bandwidth 0.001 to 1.0 Hz is of order 85 my. The DC field of the spacecraft transverse to the Earth-pointing axis is Sx = 1.0 ±2.1ϒ, SY = -2.4 ± 1.3ϒ. The spacecraft field parallel to this axis is less than 5ϒ. The small spacecraft field has made possible studies of the macroscopic field not previously possible at synchronous orbit. At the 96° west longitude of Applications Technology Satellite-6 (ATS-6), the Earth's field is typically inclined 300 to the dipole axis at local noon. Most perturbations of the field are due to substorms. These consist of a rotation in the meridian to a more radial field followed by a subsequent rotation back. The rotation back is normally accompanied by transient variations in the azimuthal field. The exact timing of these perturbations is a function of satellite location and the details of substorm development."
"The Solar Cosmic Ray and Trapped Particle Experiment was designed to study the entry, propagation, and loss of solar cosmic rays and the acceleration and loss of trapped electrons and protons in the magnetosphere. Two orthogonal proton and alpha partical telescopes measure protons from 300 keV to 250 MeV and alphas from 2 MeV to 200 MeV. Electron spectrometers measure electrons from 50 keV to 1 MeV and are used in conjunction with the 300-keV to 1.2-MeV proton channels to study the injection of electrons and protons into the magnetosphere during substorms. Two solar cosmic ray events were observed during the first four months of operation. The first of these began on July 3, 1974, and is probably one of the more complicated events in recent years. There were numerous flares and sudden commencements as well as intense fluxes of low energy plasma with a severly perturbed magnetosphere. The second solar cosmic ray event was smaller and was associated with an isolated east limb flare. The first increase was observed on September 11, 1974."
"The University of California at San Diego (UCSD) Auroral Particles Experiment on the Applications Technology Satellite-6 (ATS-6) consists of five electrostatic charged particle detectors. The features which contribute to the uniqueness of the UCSD data include a rotation capability which often allows sampling very near the direction of the magnetic field, an energy range of five orders of magnitude with a lower extreme of less than 1 eV, and a very large geometric factor which results both from a postenergy analysis electrostatic lens and from the unique ovoidal shape of the analyzing plates. A preliminary look at a subset of UCSD magnetospheric data emphasizes those phenomena which are observed as a result of the new features described. These phenomena include intense magnetic field aligned auroral particles, a persistent and very low energy dusk region enhancement, and low energy 1-10-s fluctuations tentatively identified as Alfven waves."
"The University of Minnesota Electron-Proton Spectrometer Experiment consists of two nearly identical detector assemblies. One of these assemblies was mounted in a position fixed on the satellite in the Environmental Measurements Experiments (EME) east direction and the other was rotated so that the spectrometer scanned a range of spatial directions covering 1800 from EME north to EME south through west. Each of the detector assemblies is a magnetic spectrometer containing four gold-silicon surface barrier detectors. This instrument provides a very clean separation between protons and electrons by the combination of pulse height analysis and magnetic deflection. Each detector assembly measures protons in three nominal energy ranges (30-50 keV), (50-160 keV), and (120-514 keV). Electrons also are measured in three energy intervals (30-50 keV), (150-214 keV), and (more than 500 keV). Data are transmitted from the experiment at rates as high as 8 measurements/s. Decreases in the flux of the energetic electrons and protons followed by very rapid increases are frequently observed on the nightside during periods of geomagnetic activity. Separation of temporal and spatial effects is possible using proton gradient information obtained when the detector systems are oppositely directed. Using this technique, the decreases have been interpreted as motion of the trapping region equatorward and Earthward of the satellite. The boundary motion associated with the particle recovery shows a marked local time dependence. Particle increases observed in the evening sector have been interpreted as motion from Earthward and equatorward of Applications Technology Satellite-6 (ATS-6)."
"The Aerospace Corporation energetic electron-proton spectrometer operating on Applications Technology Satellite-6 (ATS-6) detects energetic electrons in four channels between 140 keV and greater than 32 MeV, and measures energetic protons in five energy channels between 2.3 and 80 MeV and energetic alpha particles in three channels between 9.4 and 94 MeV. After more than a year of operation in orbit, the experiment continues to return excellent data on the behavior of energetic magnetospheric electrons as well as information regarding the fluxes of solar protons and alpha particles."
"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Low Energy Proton Experiment was included as part of the Applications Technology Satellite-6 (ATS-6) Environmental Measurements Experiments (EME) payload to investigate those protons thought to be responsible for the geomagnetic storm-time extraterrestrial ring current and to search for the existence of energetic heavy ions trapped or energized within the Earth's magnetosphere. The experiment employs four solid state detector telescopes consisting of two elements each in order to accomplish its scientific goals. This paper is a detailed description of the experimental techniques, instrument hardware , and calibration procedures involved in the fabrication of this scientific experiment for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) ATS-6 satellite program."
"The Low Energy Electron-Proton Experiment was designed to continually monitor the spectra and pitch angle distributions of electrons and protons from 0 to 22 keV to aid in understanding the mechanisms responsible for substorms. The particle sensors were electrostatic analyzers using electron multiplier detectors. Unfortunately , little data have been obtained because of an unknown mode of interference between the experiment and the spacecraft."
"The primary objective of the Spacecraft Attitude Precision Pointing and Slewing Adaptive Control (SAPPSAC) Experiment is to establish feasibility and evaluate capabilities of a ground-based spacecraft attitude control system, wherein RF command and telemetry links, together with a ground station on-line minicomputer, perform closed loop attitude control of the Applications Technology Satellite -6 (ATS-6). The ground processor is described, including operational characteristics and the controller software. Attitude maneuvers include precision pointing to fixed targets, slewing between targets, and generation of prescribed ground tracks. Test results show high performance and reliability for over 30 h of on-line control with no serious anomalies. Attitude stabilization relative to a prescribed target has been achieved to better than 0.007° in pitch and roll and 0.020° in yaw for a period of 43 min. Ground tracks were generated which had maximum latitude/longitude deviations less than 0.150 from reference."
"The Applications Technology Satellite-6 (ATS-6) RF interferometer is utilized primarily as a precision 3-axis attitude sensor having an unambiguous field of view of 350°. This function requires two separated ground transmitters, each using one of the two available frequency channels or sharing a single channel by time multiplexing. For 3-axis control, one uplink transmitter can provide 2-axis attitude (pitch and roll) with other sensors (e.g., a Polaris tracker) providing yaw attitude. By utilizing two uplink transmitters and the Earth sensor or three time multiplexed uplink transmitters, the interferometer can also provide measurements of ATS-6 spacecraft orbit position. Uplink frequencies are 6.150 and 6.155 GHz. The receiving antennas are spaced at 19.95 wavelengths (λ) for the vernier baseline and 1.66 λ for the coarse baseline. Spacecraft system weight is 8.39 kg (18.5 lb) and power requirement is 15.5 W. Flight evaluation results are given for the interferometer including R F link budgets, modulation of uplink carrier, signal-to-noise ratio, and dropout behavior. A hardware calibration model is described, containing major biases in the phase measurements. Techniques for flight calibration as both an attitude and spacecraft position sensor are outlined . Flight testing has shown that on-line calibration of receiver/converter biases must be performed on a short term routine basis. Interferometer resolution was found to be 0.00140 space angle with negligible noise (jitter) at transmitted power levels above 72 dBW. As an attitude sensor, the interferometer has demonstrated the ability to provide stabilization to better than 0."
"Preliminary Applications Technology Satellite-6 (ATS-6) solar cell flight experiment data through the first 325 days in synchronous orbit is present. The experiment is transmitting data on 16 different solar cell/cover glass configurations. The experiment is designed to study the effect of this orbit on select solar cells and cover glass parameters such as solar cell thickness and base resistivity, cover glass thickness variation, new cover and adhesive processes and materials such as 7940 and 7070 integral covers and the fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) covers, the COMSAT \"violet\" cell, and backside irradiation effects. The in-spece solar cell data indicate short circuit currents are higher by 1 to 8 percent than measurements made with solar simulations; maximum power varied between -1 to +6 percent . Degradation of /sc due to ultraviolet effects was determined to be about 2 percent after 50 days in orbit. All cells performed well through 325 days in orbit, except the FEP-covered cells, which appear to have increased their rate of degradation during the first eclipse season."
"Two 0.004 N thrust cesium bombardment ion thrusters have been developed and integrated on Applications Technology Satellite-6 (ATS-6) to demonstrate compatible north-south stationkeeping of a geostationary satellite. In addition to the two flight units, an identical system is undergoing extended testing on the ground to demonstrate operating lifetime. Preliminary operation of the two thrusters on ATS-6 was begun on July 17, 1974, and on October 19, 1974. Completely successful operation was achieved on the first run of each. In addition to verifying operation, the principal accomplishments were the demonstration of a total absence of interference with the communications systems, verification of the predicted spacecraft operating potential, demonstration of compatibility with the star tracker, demonstration of spacecraft attitude control by thrust vectoring, measurement of the rate of production of charge exchange ions and of the ability of biased surfaces to repel the ions. Subsequent attempts to operate the thrusters have not been successful. Analysis indicates that the problem is associated with operation of the propellant reservoirs in zero g. Thruster cleanup operations are continuing in parallel with development of solutions to the feed system problem."
"The Quartz-Crystal Microbalance Experiment provided data on the possible return of contaminants to the exterior surfaces of the spacecraft. The experiment measures the change in resonant frequency of the crystal due to deposition of material on the surface. There has been no mass accretion corresponding to the firing of hydrazine thrusters to unload the spacecraft momentum wheels. There have been accretions corresponding to the firing of the cesium ion engines."
"The Advanced Thermal Control Flight Experiment (ATFE) was launched aboard the Applications Technology Satellite-6 (ATS-6) on May 30, 1974. ATFE is designed to demonstrate the thermal control capability of a thermal diode (one-way) heat pipe, a feedback-controlled variable conductance heat pipe (FCHP) and a phase-change material (PCM). The experiment has been in almost continuous operation since launch. Flight data for the different operational modes are compared to ground-test data, and the performance of the individual components is analyzed. The system's performance with and without feedback control is also compared. Finally, the ATFE's behavior from launch through May 31, 1975, is presented. All thermal control components are performing as predicted for the existing flight environment. However, the daily reservoir and radiator temperatures during peak solar input are greater than those experienced in the ground acceptance tests. These increased temperatures have resulted in a loss of control by the FCHP for several hours around the period of maximum insolation. The higher temperatures are apparently due to contamination and/or degradation of the second surface mirrors which cover the reservoir and radiator."
"The Applications Technology Satellite-6 (ATS-6) flight accelerometers were designed to provide data for verifying the basic spacecraft vibration modes during launch, to update the analytical model of the ATA structure, and to provide a capability for detection and diagnosis of inflight and anomalies. The experiment showed accelerations less than 2.5 g during liftoff and 1.1 g or less during staging with frequencies below 80 Hz. Measured values were generally within 1 g of predicted."
"A black and white television camera was used to observe the 9-m-diameter reflector after deployment to assure proper configuration. It also observes the reflector periodically to assure that no anomalies go undetected. It has been sending excellent pictures which verify that the reflector deployed properly and remains in good shape."
"Provides instructions and guidelines to prospective authors who wish to submit manuscripts."
"A general expression based upon a maximum likelihood approach is derived for the optimal association and correlation of observations into tracks. Main features of the approach are the definition of a score function and a unified approach to track initiation, confirmation, gating and deletion logic. Simplifications are made to derive rules for suboptimal sequential processing and this sequential method is shown through simulation to give improved performance wver a more standard approach. Further applications are indicated."
"A frequency domain technique for identifying a class of nonlinear systems is presented. The class of nonlinear systems we consider in this paper consists of a power series nonlinearity sandwiched between two linear systems and the problem we address is one of identifying the transfer functions of the linear systems and the coefficients of the power series nonlinearity from the terminal behavior of the system. The identification procedure is based on a frequency domain model of the nonlinear system. The system is modeled by a set of nonlinear transfer functions in the frequency domain and the relationships between the transfer functions of the linear system, the power series coefficients of the nonlinearity, and the nonlinear transfer functions of the system are developed. The identification procedure is based on a simple algorithm for factoring the non-linear transfer functions of the system. The experimental data required for applying our identification procedure consists of the amplitude response of the system to multitone sinusoidal input. A minimum phase transfer function in a single variable is used to approximate the experimental data and the repeated application of the factoring algorithm leads to the identification of the system. Examples illustrating the use of the proposed procedure are also presented."
"A numerical optimization technique is developed for designing pairs of binary sequences suitable for radar and communication systems. Application of this method yields sequences with near uniform autocorrelation sidelobes and cross-correlation values both of approximately 1.3√N, where N is the sequenuce length. A lower bound of the minimum cross-correlation peak value has been estimated to be √N when a uniform probability distribution is assumed."
"This paper presents the result of a study on self-alignment algorithms for inertial measurement units (IMU). The primary concern is the fine alignment of an inertial platform whose base is subject to vibration and whose sensors are subject to noise. The main contribution of the paper is a new self-alignment algorithm. The algorithm incorporates together the special property of platform kinematics and the concept of least square regression. Compared to the usual self-alignment algorithm, this algorithm gives a self-alignment which can be ten times more accurate and requires less computer time and memory. In addition, the new algorithm is less sensitive to erratic measurements and computational errors."
"The ATC radar beacon system is today's primary source of surveillance ance data for air traffic control. For en route traffic control, radar and beacon data are collected at numerous long range radar (LRR) facilities and typically sent by remote control to the air traffic control center (ARTCC) by a radar microwave link (RML). Selfsupporting or guyed RML towers are installed at some LRR sites adjacent to the LRR antenna to establish a line-of-sight microwave path to the first repeater site. For these LRR sites, beacon splits and pulse-stretching effects have been observed particularly in the direction of the RML tower. This paper relates to the determination ion of the magnitude of the beacon split problem for such sites and the extent to which this problem is caused by the RML tower. It has been shown that the RML tower causes distortion in the patterns of both the directional and omnidirectional antenna. The nature and extent of these distortions are such that they tend to nullify the advantages achievable by the SLS and ISLS techniques. Consequently, the beacon split phenomenon may be referred to more specifically by the well-known \"ring-around\" effect. Finally, the paper makes a few recommendations for eliminating or reducing this problem."
"This paper considers the measurement of the distance between two closely spaced point targets by means of pulsed radar. A novel \"moment\" algorithm is introduced. It expresses the normalized distance r in terms of the second and third central moments of the received squared envelope. Compared with the conventional threshold ld algorithm, the new algorithm has smaller rms error over all ranges of interest for distance, S/N, and amplitude ratios. In comparison with maximum-likelihood or curve-fitting algorithms, the necessary computer effort is minimal."
"This paper considers the discrete-time demodulation of random angle modulated signals embedded in Gaussian noise. It is first shown, with the aid of the discrete Karhunen-Loeve expansion, that under suitable conditions, a particular nonuniform sampling digital phase lock loop (DPLL) is the approximately optimum digital al demodulator in the maximum a posterior (MAP) sense. significance is the fact that the phase detector of this digital loop consists merely of a sampler; a digital multiplier is not required at the loop input. Next, an approximate nonlinear analysis is carried out for the condition in which random phase modulation is present at the input of a first order loop of the above class. These results are confirmed by simulation. Finally, the optimum demodulators for phase and frequency modulation are derived via Kalman filtering techniques and their performances presented."
"This paper proposes a digital estimator for redundant systems which is superior to Kalman Filtering if a failure is present and reduces to Kalman Filtering if no failure is present. Fault tolerant estimation is achieved by defining the non-stationary weighting matrix associated with the nominal least squares estimator (Kalman filter) as a continuous ous nonlinear function of the measurements. Despite the nonlinear character of the failure detection and isolation feature, the estimator equations have closed form and hence require no iterative computations ions or approximations for implementation."
"The design of digital sinusoidal oscillators with finite word lengths having excellent periodicity is proposed. The design utilizes the fundamental properties of a simple second-order difference equation containing a single multiplication coefficient. Two different design methods are outlined. In the first method, a set of values of the multiplier coefficient and the initial states are selected appropriately to guarantee periodicity after quantization. In the second method, periodicity is insured by forcing one or two selected future sample values equal to certain past sample values. Experimental results of the hardware implementation of oscillators designed using both methods are included."
"A first order α - β tracking filter is evaluated on the basis of steady state tracking error when the target model is known to be in error. Simple recursive relationships for implementing the filter are derived and shown to be equivalent to a Kalman filter. An example illustrates the improvement in steady state response that is achieved."
"The radiated spectrum of an active array in which each radiating element is driven by a separate transmit amplifier differs fundamentally from that of a passive array driven by a single large transmitter because of element-to-element variations in the finer details of the transmitted waveform. This paper analyzes the relation between the transmit amplifier and the overall array spectral perforrnance."
"The paper describes a technique whereby with each physical model for fluctuating radar targets is associated a standard model and a mathematical model. All three models have radar cross section distributions and certain properties of component independence in common. A wide selection of mathematical models hence becomes available as a tool for analyzing physical target models. It is shown that the mathematical model can be represented by a quadratic form involving generalized Bessel and Gaussian components. The probability distribution of the quadratic form is derived and expressed in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions. The authors also derive the related pulse-train probability distributions for two pulse integration schemes using either scan-to-scan or pulse-to-pulse amplitude independence."
"A new generation of communication satellites carry traffic in both planes of linear polarization within the common carrier band. The tracking of these satellites puts a minor additional burden on the tracking system of the attending ground station inasmuch as communication signals at the beacon frequency, but in the orthogonal plane of polarization, form an additional noise source for the tracking ing system. This paper analyzes a dual channel monopulse tracking system using a simplified monopulse feed intended for tracking of dual polarized domestic satellites. In addition, trade-offs for the selection of system parameters are presented."
"A recent paper [1] described a novel procedure for assessing the accuracy of hyperbolic multilateration systems for the case of uncorrelated ranging errors. Basically the procedure reduced the problem of assessing accuracy to that of calculating the moments and products of inertia of a simple mass constellation. This paper derives analogous results for range-range and range-sum multilateration tion systems. It also extends the results to take account of an independent position fix (e. g., barometric altitude). The new results have numerous uses. For example, the results make crystal clear the relative accuracies of the hyperbolic, range-range, and range-sum techniques. The results also make it easy to understand the salient accuracy characteristics of practical satellite-based and ground-based multilateration systems. Finally, the results provide a basis for deriving new bounds on the performance of range-range and range-sum systems."
 "Upper bounds on the probability of error due to co-channel interference are proposed in this correspondence. The bounds are easy to compute and can be fairly tight."
"The problem of guiding an instrumented aircraft to follow a pre-assigned trajectory using the Portable Automatic Calibration Tracker (PACT) data is considered in this paper. Guidance control is formulated as an optimal linear state regulator problem for a discrete time-delayed system. Responses to some flight courses of interest have, been achieved through computer system simulation. Post-flight test data obtained from the PACT confirm the basic validity of the theoretical results."
"Radar map-matching location-estimation systems compare radar images of the terrain with a memory \"map\" to obtain an estimate of sensor position in the mapped area for guidance. This correspondence summarizes a data-acquisition program involving an omnidirectional range-scan radar sensor, and presents results of theoretical guidance exercises based on comparing actual radar signals with computer-generated memories."
   "This note describes a class of pulse compression codes which were discovered by examining the properties of the prime transform algorithm [1]. For each prime P, phase hop sequences of length P-1 can be constructed whose periodic autocorrelation functions have constant sidelobe height of -1 relative to the main peak value of P-1."

"Earlier reported tests have demonstrated that sufficient ultrasonic scattering can be obtained from particulate matter in urine during voiding to be of value as a transcutaneous diagnostic technique for the lower urinary tract. In this paper, we compare theoretical scattering computations for urethral flow models with data obtained from scattering measurements on the urethra and on physical models. The results indicate that urethral parameters such as the average urine velocity, extent of turbulence, and urethral diameter as a function of position along the tract, including the location of any strictures, can be determined remotely by ultrasonic means."
"The nuclear magnetic relaxation time T1 of protons in human blood has been measured as a function of frequency, pH, and hematocrit. For whole blood at 25°C, T1 is approximately 0.1 s at 20 kHz, increasing to approximately 1 s at 50 MHz. T1 of whole blood is analyzed in terms of the exchange of water molecules between plasma and erythrocyte cytoplasm. A cellular residence time of 19 ms provides the best fit to the data. The T1values for plasma and cytoplasm are explained in terms of their protein content, using the well-established theory of nuclear relaxation in macromolecular solutions. The plasma and cytoplasm data are compared with previous T1 results for apotransferrin and hemoglobin solutions, respectively, and qualitative agreement is found. The T1 values increased with decreasing pH, as is expected from existing data on hemoglobin solutions."
"This paper demonstrates that fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns can be classified by algorithmically determined linear discriminants. A nonparametric learning algorithm was applied to 17 samples of five-vectors. The coordinates of each sample vector were visual features derived from the FHR curve and the simultaneous uterine contraction pressure data in accord with medical training-literature. Data were obtained from strip-chart recordings from the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, where an FHR monitoring and on-line computer processing system based on an IBM System/7 is being installed. The algorithm converged to linear discriminants that correctly classified all the 17 training samples under four different combinations of initial weights, training sequence, and correction increment. Each of the four linear decision rules so obtained was applied to 14 new sample vectors. Three classified 11 samples correctly and one classified 13 samples correctly. Medical anomalies (atypical data) were present in all three misclassified patterns. A perfect success record was found in classifying all seven medically ominous new sample vectors."
"This paper describes an electrically calibrated plethysmograph which may be used with all lengths of mercury-in-rubber strain gauges. Due to the very low resistance of these strain gauges, electrical calibration of previously available plethysmographs has suffered from errors caused by lead-wire resistance. The present instrument eliminates lead-wire errors by a design which effectively places the strain gauge at the corners of the measurement bridge. Linearity of the output for large changes in gauge resistance has been insured by the incorporation of a constant-current bridge supply."
"A new ECG monitoring technique is described which can detect the condition of digitalis toxicity prior to the onset of arrhythmias. The technique is based on experiments with mice in which digitalis toxicity was induced by the administration of the cardiac glycoside, ouabain. Results are shown in which spreading of the QRS complex is a consistent precursor of premature ventricular contractions and ventricular fibrillation. Both high and low dose studies are described."
"A technique for the localization of cytoplasmic and nucleic material in Wrights and Wrights-Giemsa strained blood cells is described. The microscopic field of view is first scanned with three different wavelengths of light and then digitized with the aid of a microscopic/vidicon/computer. Each of the three pictures is then converted to a binary color picture by comparison with three calculated clipping levels. The three binary color pictures are then logically combined to generate ``masks'' or sets of points which correspond to 1)nucleic points in the picture, 2) cytoplasmic points in the picture, and 3)red-cell points in the picture. The algorithms involved are easy to implement either in hardware or software, and execute very rapidly in either environment."
"A piezoelectric heart assist device was designed, and preliminary tests were performed in vitro and in vivo. The device has the advantages of simple construction, low power consumption (approximately one watt), electrical rather than pneumatic drive, and noiseless operation. The device consists of piezoelectric bender elements forming two cantilevers. A unique feature of the device is that two tungsten alloy masses, 0.44 kg each, were added to the free ends of the cantilevers to reduce the resonant frequency to 2.5 Hz. The driving voltage was a 320 V peak-to-peak square wave synchronized with a paced heartbeat."
"A model for the glucose-insulin control system has been developed. The primary controllers in this model are the pancreas and liver. These subsystems operate within the metabolic environment to maintain normal glucose levels. The prime control variables for each subsystem, as well as for systemic glucose utilization, are the plasma glucose and insulin concentrations perfusing these organs."
"Threshold is often defined as that stimulus intensity which is correctly detected 50% of the time. A titration procedure increases the stimulus intensity by a fixed increment if the subject fails to detect the stimulus, and decreases the stimulus if it is detected. The mean stimulus intensity thus obtained is an estimate of threshold. The Markoff chain model developed here allows the mean and variance of the mean to be calculated for any specified stimulus values, number of trials, and distribution of the underlying variate. Examples are given to illustrate the effects of changing the experimental parameters and the underlying distribution. The titration mean was fairly insensitive to these changes."
"A detailed analysis shows how electrosurgical r-f power is localized in the vicinity of the cutting electrode. This localization requires a small radius of curvature for the surgical tip, relatively high r-f voltages, and rapid surgical tip motion. The erratic results sometimes encountered in electrosurgery may be due to a deficiency in the above procedures as well as a lack of care in the use of the r-f leads and ground plates. A further analysis supports the supposition that evolving steam bubbles in the tissue at the surgical tip continuously rupture the tissue and are responsible for the cutting mechanism."
"Several basic facts about the effects of steel conduits in A.C. power systems are reviewed to show that the geometry of a grounding path may have a greater effect on its effectiveness as a ground return path than its D.C. resistance. Data are presented on the effect of ½\" E.M.T. conduit and No. 10 conductors in tests simulating regular room wiring under ground fault conditions."
"Based on a design by the root locus method and utilizing both displacement and force feedback an instrument is described which can be used to deliver either controlled displacement or controlled force stimuli to the skin. Examples of the stimulator operated in each of its two modes are given."
"A simple, inexpensive device capable of measuring the refractory period of the cardiac conducting system has been described. All components used in the device may be purchased for less than $150 and commercial equipment capable of performing similar tasks costs over two-thousand dollars. The undesired features of previous methods have been eliminated and results of using the device in clinical settings have been given."
"The distortion effects upon the measurement of EEG spectra are investigated. A non-linear model of zero-memory type is used for the input-output relation of the measurement system. The model is identified by means of measured second and third harmonics. Examples illustrate the distortion effects upon power spectra of waking infant and adult EEG's."
"The complex dielectric constant of human, primate, canine, ovine, and swine brain tissues at 37°C was measured in S band using a slotted waveguide section. The in vitro measurements indicate that mammalian brains exhibit very little dispersion within the frequency range of 2.25 to 3.95 GHz. The dielectric constant was found between 30 and 35 and the conductivity varied from 1.1 to 3.1 mho/m."
"A versatile temperature controlled microwave exposure chamber has been designed especially for use in microwave bio-effects research. The device uses a thermoelectric heat pump to cool the air in the chamber below ambient and a resistive heater for above ambient operation. A unique feature of the exposure chamber is that the radiating antenna can be either inside or outside of the chamber."
"Finite difference calculations of the transient radial temperature distribution in living tissue are compared with an analytical solution in which metabolism, blood flow rate, and arterial blood temperature vary with time. The effects of node spacing and integration time interval on the accuracy of the finite difference calculations are investigated."
"A mathematical model of the human temperature regulatory system has been constructed and tested. The number of finite difference nodes used to approximate the radial temperature distribution in each of the major body elements was independently varied. For exposure to warm environments, a four node unequally spaced configuration is adequate, while ten nodes unequally spaced are adequate in cold air environments."

 "The future of biomedical engineering is not in the classroom or the laboratory. The funds available are simply not designed to support the further development of a basic science base, and they are miniscule compared with the nearly $100 billion per year spent on health care. The biomedical engineer must turn his attention to problems of the system as a whole. Each year the cost of medical care rises sharply and unfortunately a part is due to the often unnecessary sophistication or over-development of instrumentation. Research and development are badly needed in the areas of automation. Need for computer controls, communications and transportation, system design, optimum utilization of resources, and redesign of the system to provide health care where the people are rather than where the doctor is located are all indications that the biomedical engineer can find a fruitful career in these areas rather than in the rapidly saturating areas of teaching and basic research."
"As of this date, biomedical engineering has become a recognized profession. The full impact of its efforts in the health related fields is just becoming visible to the leaders of the health delivery systems. As a profession it differs markedly from traditional engineering disciplines; however, that is the reason it has come into being. The demand for individuals well trained in the biomedical engineering sciences appears to be insatiable. This is due to the belated recognition by many members of the health delivery system hierarchy of the true role and contribution of the well-trained biomedical engineer. This article discusses the sociological and technological factors that have been influencial in the establishment of the science of biomedical engineering."
"DURING the past decade biomedical engineering has matured as a profession, and its diversity has been increasingly recognized. At the same time the environment external to biomedical engineering has changed rapidly. It has changed politically, socially, and economically. It is the thesis of this essay that biomedical engineering must recognize these external changes and define our goals and objectives in a fashion consonant with and responsive to these changes. To be unresponsive to environmental changes is to invite the fate of the dinosaur-only our fossilized remains will mark our existence. It makes little difference whether the unresponsiveness is through ignorance, inertia, or obstinacy; the ultimate result will be the same."
 "Although we have heard a great deal about the potential of biomedical engineering in health care, utilization of engineering and technology in the health care field has not progressed as expected. Reasons for this situation are presented and they include the points of view in industry, engineering and the medical community. Expanded and successful use of clinical engineers in health care institutions, the development of relevant educational curricula and a continuum of medical engineering education, as well as early involvement of biomedical engineering in the planning of health care delivery at Federal, State and district levels, could expedite the engineering medical interaction."
"Results of a Biomedical Engineering Educational Questionnaire, which was sent to 222 engineering schools, are analyzed and a summary directory is presented. Of the schools queried, 121 had degrees or programs in Biomedical Engineering, and 49 schools awarded degrees; 38 awarded Ph.D. degrees, 37 awarded M.S. degrees, and 25 awarded B.S. degrees. Options or programs in Biomedical Engineering were available in 88 schools in which the student received some other engineering degree. No degrees or programs were available at 76 schools, and 25 did not reply. The student enrollment for the 1973 fall semester was 3,769, and the total number of graduates since 1965 was 2,889. Current enrollment by degree is 1,530 for the B.S., 1,306 for the M.S., and 933 for the Ph.D. Degrees awarded since 1965 were 574 for the B.S., 1,424 for the M.S., and 891 for the Ph.D."
"Various philosophical approaches to bioengineering education result in the development of different pathways and programs. The basic underlying assumptions of the University of Washington program are presented along with a discussion of the operation of a nondepartmental approach. Undergraduate and graduate education are discussed in the context of preparing the engineer for participation in collaborative teams. A key element in the success of such teams is the introduction of the physician or life scientist to the principles of engineering. A program to provide such training is described along with a discussion about its impact on biomedical research particularly at this University."
 "This paper describes the development of an internship program between St. Vincent Hospital (SVH), a large community teaching hospital, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), a school of engineering. The primary objective of the internship program is the education of the student through problem solving in the hospital environment under close faculty-physician supervision. WPI receives an expanded educational base, and SVH receives a diversified base of technical assistance. During the last three years of operation 70 students, 12 faculty, and 15 hospital project advisors have worked together on 29 different student projects. The organization and operation of the internship program are presented, and the essential features leading to its success are analyzed."
"The well-documented emergence of Bioengineering from independent research into clinical problem-solving has influenced the development of Bioengineering education at Carnegie-Mellon. Offered as an option to undergraduates, Bioengineering supplements the basic curriculum of an Engineering department with courses in the life sciences, clinical and instrumentation laboratories, and a hospital internship. These laboratories and internship, which are described here in detail, have as their purpose to provide the student with a familiarity with engineering applications in the medical field and to encourage the ability to work cooperatively in the clinical environment. These specific skills are to be added to the general engineering excellence and ability for independent growth which are the goals of the basic departmental curricula. Two years from its introduction, enrollment in the option has grown to a total of 49 undergraduates for the current academic year."
"With the increase in the number of biomedical equipment technicians (BMET's), there has been a corresponding need for opportunities for their career growth. California State University, Sacramento, is developing a ``career ladder'' program designed to meet this need. This program has been initiated in conjunction with Napa College. By carefully selecting college-level electives in the BMET program, following the mathematics sequence which includes calculus, granting credit for certain required lower division (freshman and sophomore) engineering courses, and providing the opportunity for credit by examination, we have initiated a career ladder program requiring 5 semesters beyond the two year terminal degree. This program retains the technical content of a standard engineering curriculum while also emphasizing the course work and experience of the BMET."
"While a considerable number of bioengineers have been trained during the past few years, relatively few have found challenging jobs in industry. This is due in part to the level of development of the biomedical industry and to the type of training received by the bioengineers. However, significant industrial roles have developed for bioengineers including management of R & D projects, clinical evaluation, and collaborative professional relationships with clinicians in the medical community. Bioengineers have not been most effective in the product design process. A need exists for additional training for bioengineers in the role of project leadership and in the technical areas of the interface of body tissues with materials and electrical current."

"Recent papers have shown that the ECG depends on the flow sources of the impressed field in the heart while the MCG is a function of its vortex source distribution. It has consequently been suggested that body surface electric and magnetic recordings yield completely independent information about the physiological generators. Such independence would be of enormous significance wherever present diagnostic procedures rely heavily on the ECG or EEG. This paper points out that the independence of the flow and vortex sources is only a mathematical possibility. It demonstrates that two important physical constraints are operating which require the flow and vortex sources to be, in effect, one-to-one with each other. Consequently, the electric and magnetic fields arising from excitable tissue in an assumed homogeneous volume conductor are fundamentally interdependent."
"A description of the measurement techniques for obtaining vector magnetocardiograms (MCG) and a discussion of the significance of the MCG is presented. A map of vector MCG is shown in terms of its three components on a plane above the chest for both the magnetic analog of the QRS wave and the T wave. The waveform of the vector MCG is described and contrasted with the electrocardiogram (ECG). Studies of the variation of MCG patterns with age and weight are performed on twelve separate subjects. The data reveal a correlation between the MCG QRS amplitude and weight, and in the younger subjects a large T wave relative to the QRS amplitude. It is concluded that further studies of MCG waveforms are required to establish the nature and extent of the correlation. The amplitude of the MCG is a physically significant quantity, in that it is directly related to the magnitude and configuration of the current system in the heart and its vicinity. A discussion and calculation of a theoretical model to account for the current distribution associated with the MCG is presented."
"The models considered in this study are those of Spach et al., [1], and Clark and Plonsey [6], [7]. Both assume circular cylindrical geometry for the isolated Purkinje strand and input information to the models consists mainly of the recorded transmembrane action potential, the ratio of conductivities of the intra- and extracellular media, the conduction velocity of the action potential, and the radius of the strand. In general the extracellular potentials computed using both methods agree with measured potential data and with each other. However, the Clark-Plonsey method provides a more accurate prediction of both the peak-to-peak magnitude and the separation between peaks of the bipolar extracellular potential waveform, particularly at field points close to the strand."
"The Choroidal Eye Oximeter is an electro-optical instrument that non-invasively measures the oxygen saturation of choroidal blood in the back of the human eye by a spectrophotometric method. Since choroidal blood is characteristic of blood which is supplied to the brain, the Choroidal Eye Oximeter is essentially using the eye as a ``window'' to look into the brain. The instrument can thus be used to monitor the amount of oxygen which is supplied to the brain under varying external conditions. The instrument consists of two basic systems: the Optical System and the Electronic System. The Optical System produces a suitable bi-chromatic beam of light, reflects this beam from the fundus of the subject's eye, and onto a low-noise photodetector. The Electronic System amplifies the weak composite signal from the photodetector, separates the two spectral components, computes the average oxygen saturation from the area of the fundus that was sampled, and displays the value of the computed oxygen saturation on a panel meter. The instrument may be used with a chart recorder to continuously record the kinetic changes of either the oxygen saturation or the fundus reflectivity at each of the two measuring wavelengths."
"A digital computer program, MITNYS-II, has been developed for on-line analysis of nystagmus which results from visual, vestibular or caloric stimulation. The program accepts sampled records of eye position and yields cumulative slow phase position, slow phase velocity, instantaneous fast phase frequency and other parameters in 25 ms. In this paper the algorithms by which fast phases are detected, and by which slow phase cumulative eye position is extrapolated across the fast phase interval are described. Extensive tests with vestibular, optokinetic and caloric nystagmus yield reliability figures of the order of 2% for false identification of fast phases and missed fast phases. MITNYS-II has been successfully employed to interpret clinical EOG records, examples of which are presented."
"A simple electromagnetic system is described which allows simultaneous monitoring of vertical and horizontal eye movements in the unrestrained cat. A restricted magnetic field is induced through a coil fixed to the zygomatic bone, under the skin. The coil leads led subdermally to a skull implanted pedestal are connected to a 15000 Hz sine-wave generator. The induced field is detected through a small coil stitched to the side of the eyeball between the iris and medial rectus muscle attachment. The detecting coil leads are connected to the head pedestal connector, then sent to a detecting amplifier whose output is implanted perpendicular to the first provides eye movement monitoring in the other direction of space."
"An instrument capable of constant current stimulation of biological preparations is described. The device can be automatically programmed in an on-line manner by a digital computer or special purpose logic. Experiments are freed of the time consuming and error producing task of continually monitoring experimental situations. Several biological uses of this instrument are discussed."
"A multielectrode structure containing integrated junction-FET input stages is described. Photoengraved microelectrodes are utilized to obtain high dimensional precision, small size, and extremely low capacitive coupling between electrodes. The interelectrode capacitance is less than 0.01 pf. The integrated input devices (JFET's) reduce the impedance levels on the recording channels to less than 500 ohms, virtually eliminating crosstalk and stray noise pickup from the system. The n-channel JFET's operate as source-followers from a common 2.5 volt drain supply and have input impedances greater than 100 megohms at 1 kHz. A simple external preamplifier ensures stable operation and easy interfacing with conventional recording and display equipment. Special considerations in the design of low-noise completely integrated input stages for use with metal microelectrodes are discussed in detail. As a result of the low interelectrode coupling in this structure, simultaneous recording and stimulation from closely adjacent areas of brain should be possible with virtually no stimulus artifact."
"The optical and electronic design features of a reliable microspectrofluorometer that allows successful microfluorometric studies in areas of brain ischemia over a period of 2.0 hours are described in detail. The apparatus allows moment-to-moment recording of the oxidation-reduction state of brain mitochondria in areas of ischemia and therefore affords the potential of measuring the immediate effect of a variety of drugs designed either to increase blood flow in areas of ischemia or to support marginal metabolism. Problems of choice of anesthetic agent, hemoglobin artifact, photodecomposition, and preparation reliability are discussed."
"The electromyogram of a single motor unit is studied by considering it as a time function defined by a convolution integral where a point process input passes through a filter whose impulse response is the shape of a single motor unit action potential. The interspike intervals are assumed to be normally distributed, independent random variables. Simulation is performed on a digital computer. The theoretical analysis shows that the absolute value of the ensemble average of the Fourier transform of the simulated EMG approaches the absolute value of the Fourier transform of the motor unit potential. This has been confirmed by simulation except at the very low end of the spectrum. These results are compared with the Fourier transforms of the recorded surface EMG data from human muscles."
"Structures characterized by a brightness contour can be automatically detected when the information is carried by a video signal. The detection system described here processes the available position and brightness information of the picture in a way closely related to the features of such structures. Real time processing of the picture information is made possible by the use of very simple memories. The electronic implementation of the detection procedure is dedicated to the extraction of the left ventricular contour out of angiographs. Compared with manual contour tracking the application in diagnostic cardiology will lead to a considerable time saving and improved reproducibility."
"Several Factors affecting artificial heart output were studied employing two mathematical models of prosthetic hearts, i.e., sac and diaphragm heart models. The stroke volume sensitivity to changes in venous pressure was analyzed by numerical computations. Increased inflow valve resistance, increased pump vacuum pressure, decreased elasticity of the ventricular sac or diaphragm and decreased size of the ventricle were shown to depress artificial heart function. In total prosthetic heart replacement experiments in calves, the resistance at the junction of the right heart to the natural atrium was measured by varying the pump vacuum pressure. When the vacuum pressure exceeded -20 mmHg, the orifice resistance to flow increased approximately 4 times. Optimizing the above factors, a prosthetic heart should be designed that provides sufficient flow with a pump vacuum pressure not greater than -20 mmHg."
"A shortcoming of the Median Evoked Response is discussed and a means for dealing with it is suggested."
"This paper develops an approach to the problem of parameter identification from a signal which is a finite sum of possibly delayed exponentials. The coefficients and exponents, as well as the time delays, are found using a noniterative algorithm based on a matrix formulation of discrete-time convolution. Two methods of application are discussed and an example is included."
"A commercial transducer combining a gallium arsenide infrared emitting diode and silicon phototransistor has been adapted for use as a photoelectric plethysmograph. This device is superior to the tungsten lamp-photoconductive cell plethysmograph generally available."
"An implantable pressure telemetry capsule was developed to permit monitoring cuff pressure in an artificial urethral sphincter during chronic conditions. Following implantation, the baseline frequency of the capsule was observed to increase by nearly 2 percent. A series of experiments was then conducted to determine whether this increase was caused by the temperature rise after implant, by fluid migration through the Silastic diaphragm, or by permeation of water vapor through the epoxy encapsulating the electronics. Elevated temperatures accounted for 84.5 percent of the frequency increase, migration through the diaphragm 11.85 percent of the total, and water permeation through the epoxy 3.65 percent."
"Triboelectric noise resulting from motion in the patient vicinity has been observed to occasionally interfere with the ECG. Experiments were performed to verify the nature of the interference and to define the factors which enable this ever-present phenomenon to interfere with ECG acquisition. No instances have been observed that could not be corrected by good electrode placement technique. This study shows that currents produced during the generation or discharge of static electricity can be easily and accurately measured, and the technique used may be applicable to other areas of investigation."
"An economical precision digital heart rate meter has been constructed for use in general laboratory EKG studies and especially as a diagnostic aid in pacemaker clinics. The instrument features a digital method for rate computation with no calibration required, a system test feature and ability to measure and digitally display both heart rate in beats per minute (bpm) and R-R interval in miliseconds."
"A simple goniometric system intended for quantitative evaluation of a patients' gait is described. The hip, knee and ankle angles of both legs in the sagittal plane and the contacts between ground and three parts of the sole were measured. By using a special knob to adjust and fix the knee potentiometer axis position, a small number of selectively chosen attachments and very light construction, the gait was disturbed to the minimum extent. The system's accuracy was tested by comparing the directly measured step length and the calculated one. The accuracy achieved was better than 5%."
"A new method for analysis and recording of gait parameters is reported. This method consists of a television camera interfaced with a PDP-11/10 minicomputer. The TV camera picks up anatomical points of interest such as knee joint, ankle joint, etc., to which small lights are attached and the computer calculates their coordinates and joint angles as a function of time."
"Series resonant coil systems are being used to study the effects of ELF magnetic fields on living systems. High inductive voltages generate electric fields that prevent the separation of magnetic and electric field effects. These electric fields can be reduced by using multiple capacitor banks and connecting the coils and capacitors so that the electric fields cancel each other."

"Heart block is a potential complication in the surgical repair of several congenital cardiac defects. The proximity of the bundle of His to these defects makes their repair particularly hazardous. Earlier workers devised a method for the anatomic localization of portions of the conduction system at the time of cardiotomy. This method is inefficient and time-consuming and therefore has not received general acceptance. This paper describes an instrument which expands upon that method to facilitate and expedite the localization process. This should enhance the overall utility of the method. The instrument is self-contained, reduces the signal complexity arriving from the exploring probe, analyzes the waveforms and responds instantly with an audible tone when the probe overlies the bundle of His."
"THE BIOLOGICAL measurement of PO2 (partial pressure of oxygen) in the blood or various other tissues is today a very common and important parameter in the evaluation of patients in various states of health. Routine PO2 measurements are carried out by sampling the blood at relatively large time intervals and utilizing the well-known Clarke-type electrodes [1]. These electrodes are relatively large and are included in the various biological gas measurement systems widely used in every hospital."
"We present a new instrument that, when connected with any standard electrocardiograph, permits clinical analysis of analog pulses as generated by implanted pacemakers."
"On account of noise, considerable errors appear in standard pressure-record estimates of left ventricular performance. These errors can be reduced by adequate data processing. A clinically useful criterion of such processing of left ventricular pressure is presented. The reproducibility and clinical usefulness of the method are demonstrated by application to a number of experimental records as well as to a series of simulated pressure waves."
"We describe a system for measurement of the dynamic mechanical properties of small bundles of myofibrils of muscle. Underwater fiber-optic sensing of tension via displacement of a quartz beam has been accomplished with a noise level of about 100 nanoNewtons in a bandwidth of 1 to 40 Hz."
"Recent advances in the fields of automatic EEG analysis and pattern recognition provide a valuable new perspective for reconsidering the question of whether or not the level of anesthesia can be reliably estimated by analyzing spontaneous EEG activity. The feasibility of developing a computer-based EEG pattern recognition system capable of continuously estimating the level of anesthesia of patients during surgical operations is investigated in this paper. Anesthetists were asked to define five clinically significant levels of anesthesia for a commonly used anesthetic in terms of meaningful non-EEG criteria. The subsequent development of various EEG pattern recognition systems in an attempt to reliably estimate the levels of anesthesia as determined by the non-EEG criteria is described. All such systems employ Bayes decision rule under the assumption that pattern features are statistically independent. System performance is evaluated in terms of the estimated probability of misclassification error. Systems based on the recognition of spectral or frequency-domain EEG patterns are compared to those based on the recognition of time-domain EEG patterns."
"An electronic analog model of a section of the vertebrate retina has been constructed. It is structured in 5 layers of cells corresponding to the structure of the natural retina, whereby the function and connections of the single cell models can be varied. While signal processing occurs in the first four layers by evaluating several timedependent slow potentials as positive or negative, impulse rate time functions are emitted from the ganglion cells at the retina output. Various neural networks as inputs for the 25 Ganglion cells can be realized by using various patchboard connections. Several examples for simulation results are presented which closely fit comparable neurophysiological findings."
"An on-line focusing procedure for a computer-controlled microscope employed in the measurement of human chromosome images is discussed. The method is based on an algorithm proposed by Mendelsohn and Mayall. A focusing accuracy of standard deviation less than 1/20th micron in the slide-objective distance has been achieved. Changes of the focus position with time, and for individual chromosomes within a metaphase, have been investigated. The method has proved insensitive to imperfections in the scanner photocathode. The method has also been used to determine the autofocusing accuracy of an analog metaphase-finding apparatus."
"The purpose of this study is to develop a pulmonary model and determine the frequency response sensitivity of mechanical parameters such as impedance, dynamic compliance, and dynamic resistance as a function of individual airway properties. Computer simulations of a three compartment model of various physiological cases were used to determine lung parameters as a function of frequency, peripheral airway contribution to total airway resistance, and relative percent obstruction of the peripheral airways. Provided our present concepts of the lung are valid and adequately incorporated into the present model, our results indicate the utility of frequency dependence as a measure of airway obstruction."
"To provide a more independent alternative to the well established pneumatic artificial arm systems, body weight acting through small reciprocating pumps in the heels of the shoes is used as the power source for a self-contained hydraulic circuit. Energized by normal walking, hydraulic fluid is drawn from a flexible reservoir and delivered at high pressure to an hydraulic accumulator."
"Human coronary artery stenosis can have dramatic hemodynamic effects on coronary flow rate and perfusion. To quantitatively investigate these relationships, nineteen proximal coronary arteries with varying focal stenoses (2%-98%) were dissected from fresh post mortem adult hearts and perfused with isotonic glycerol saline (n = 2.7 centipoise) at constant pressures of 30, 50, 75, 100, 150 and 200 mm Hg, while varying the distal bed resistance (rb) over the range 0.1 to 5 mm Hg/ml/min. Flow rate (Q) and arterial segment pressure drop (ΔP) were measured at each perfusion pressure and rb, and a permanent cast of silicone rubber was made under 100 mm Hg pressure following perfusion. Hydraulic resistance (R = ΔP/Q) tended to be constant at low Q (10-30 ml/min), with resistance increasing 2 or 3 times at higher Q (30-100 + ml/min). Curves of Q vs. % stenosis showed that Q was relatively constant with stenoses less than 70-80%. With a small further increase in stenosis, however, Q decreased dramatically. Furthermore, significant reductions occurred at lower % stenoses for greater demands (lower rb), a contributing factor toward effort angina, as less severe stenoses became increasingly significant under flow demand. Elastic effects in eccentric lesions produced additional flow losses at lowered perfusion pressures. In addition, a critical relation was demonstrated between percent stenosis and the minimum coronary perfusion pressure necessary to maintain a given Q."
"A feasibility study indicates that ultrasound backscattering may be used to determine the onset of the formation of a fibrin clot in plasma and whole blood. Experimental results with blood and plasma containing different amounts of fibrinogen are presented."
"Pulse-echo ultrasound, a valuable tool for noninvasive cardiac examination, has been used extensively to determine left ventricular volume and wall thickness. It is often difficult, however, to visualize simultaneously the endocardial and epicardial surfaces of the left ventricular posterior wall because of dynamic range and grey scale limitations. Although the signal reflected at the epicardial-lung interface is much stronger than the signal from surrounding myocardium and lung, it is often obliterated when the receiver gain is increased sufficiently to record the endocardial echo. We have developed a switched gain technique which allows both wall surfaces to be visualized in real time. An oscillator rapidly switches the receiver gain between two levels that are independently set to display the two wall surfaces; thus, echograms are generated with high and low gain portions closely mixed. The endocardial surface is seen best at high gain; the epicardial surface at lower amplification."
"Ultrasonic diagnostic equipment has seen rapid development and utilization in various fields of diagnostic medicine."
"From the suprasternal notch blood flow velocity in the aorta can be measured non-invasively by a Doppler probe. Integration over systole after frequency analysis gives a measure of stroke volume if a separate diameter observation is incorporated. Frequency analysis by a zero crossing counter or by a set of parallel phaselock loops was less effective than a set of bandpass filters. Observations on dogs, baboons and humans before and after exercise or surgery suggest the indications to be useful. Application to judging heart failure by the effect of introducing a volume load is indicated. Changes in output also are measured in freely moving subjects."
"This work is directed toward reducing the number of parameters necessary to describe the electrical activity of the heart. The approach taken is one of template matching using a linear combination of a set of template waveforms to fit a set of pattern waveforms. Using selected electrocardiogram (EKG) waveforms as a template results in a great reduction in the number of parameters needed to match other EKGs."

"Considerable motivation exists for the development of an adequate statistical model for spontaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. At present, almost all methods of time-domain and frequency-domain EEG analysis are based on implicit assumptions regarding the statistical characteristics of the underlying random process, particularly with respect to the extent of stationarity and Gaussianity of the process. However, the actual characteristics of specific EEG ensembles have not been extensively investigated. In this paper, a technique is proposed for estimating the degree of wide-sense stationarity and the degree of Gaussianity of an ensemble of EEG records. Results which have been obtained by applying this technique to three relatively large ensembles of multichannel EEG data are also described. In addition, the comparative advantages of employing alternate methods of EEG analysis are discussed in relation to the estimated degree of stationarity and Gaussianity of the particular EEG ensembles under consideration."
"In order to extract maximum information from electroretingraphic waveforms obtained under clinical conditions, it is necessary to have reliable quantitative methods to characterize both the amplitude and shape of these waveforms. When sinusoidally modulated light is used to stimulate the retina, the resulting ERG potentials are, in general, not sinusoidal due to the nonlinearities in the system. However, the responses are very reproducible and can easily be characterized by a few parameters based on a Fourier analysis. The more conventional flash ERG, although usually of higher amplitude, is much less reproducible in shape and needs many more parameters to characterize completely. Amplitude and phase characteristics can be understood on the basis of a simple model for the scotopic B-wave system and additive interaction by the photopic system. Changes in amplitude and phase characteristics with various experimental conditions could be predicted and were confirmed by subsequent experiments. The ultimate goal of this work is to improve the quantitative basis for clinical electroretinography and to provide the clinician with additional data which can be useful in the diagnosis of retinal diseases."
"An algorithm is presented for estimating the time course of intracellular generator potentials on the basis of the times of occurrence of evoked neural impulses, under conditions of external sinusoidal stimulation, and assuming SS-IPFM encoding. Recorded neural pulses are applied to the output of a theoretical SS-IPFM encoder (``in reverse'') and a least-squares criterion is adopted for estimating the input sinusoid and its harmonics which would have given rise to the same train of pulses. Illustrative simulation examples of the algorithm are given, and its practical applications are discussed."
"The subject of this study is optimal mode control for the left ventricular bypass pump used to assist the failing heart. A mathematical model has been formulated for the overall cardiovascular system both with and without bypass assistance. The closed-loop, uncontrolled model of the unassisted circulation has been implemented on an analog computer and has been demonstrated capable of simulating normal as well as abnormal physiological behavior. A simple bypass pump model has been implemented and shown to produce the general hemodynamic effects expected during assistance: pressure in the left atrium is diminished while that in the systemic arterial load is increased. Four logical modes of pump control have been described and compared on the basis of their effect upon a scalar performance index used to reflect the basic goals of cardiac assistance."
"Relationships between the change in a representative alveolar pressure in a pulmonary system which acts as a single mechanical compartment and changes in measurable variables are derived for several plethysmographic systems. Derivations considering air as a one-component gas are presented for the pressure and flow-displacement plethysmographs in which the subject exchanges respired gas with air in the box, and for a plethysmograph from which the subject breathes gas from outside the box using a tube through the box wall. A set of assumptions and approximations which can be invoked to develop the standard differential plethysmographic equations is explicitly stated. The analysis is extended to include multicomponent gas mixtures and mass exchange between alveolar gas and blood for a generalized plethysmographic configuration. Some practical requirements on experimental conditions arising from the derived relationships and the assumptions and approximations used in the derivations are considered."
"A design technique, based on the model reference adaptive control approach for the long term ventilation of the lungs is presented. The design objective is to minimize the harmful effects (e.g., interference in the circulatory system, mechanical damage, etc.) due to possible change in the patient's respiratory parameters (i.e., the airway resistance and the lung and chest wall compliance) during the long term ventilation of the lungs. A model, consisting of a fixed resistance capacitance, RC, analog network is used to generate a ``desire'' alveolar pressure profile. The instantaneous difference in the alveolar pressures, obtained from the comparison of the actual patient and his ``desired'' behavior, is fed to an ``adaptive controller.'' The controller, in turn, will adjust the respirator's output pressure (to the patient) in such a way, that the instantaneous difference in alveolar pressure is reduced to zero. The stability of this newly designed adaptive system is ensured by using Lyapunov's direct method in obtaining the updating laws for the adaptive controller. Using a similar design approach, a respiratory parameters identification scheme is introduced. This identification process is able to generate, indirectly, a continuous estimation of the patient's alveolar pressure (which normally is not monitorable in the actual patient) for the purpose of comparison, in this newly designed adaptive system. Digital simulations of the respirator's pressure control and the identification process, as well as the simulation of the combined system, were performed. The result has indeed demonstrated the ability of a speedy performance of this adaptive system."
"The process of breathing liquid requires consideration of several problems not typical in gas respiration. These problems stem from the physical properties of liquid such as density, viscosity, and low diffusivity of gases which increase respiratory work. The objective of this study was to develop and study the feasibility of a demand controlled system for providing mechanical assistance and ameliorating respiratory work during liquid breathing."
"The body current activated circuit breaker (BAB), provides a new means of protection from accidental electric shock. It senses the current flowing in the body and reacts to, a dangerous situation by interrupting the power source. An experimental model using a toroidal coil sensor was built and tested successfully."
"Frequently in measuring physiological variables it is necessary to store an electrical signal for relatively long periods of time. The circuit presented has been designed for this purpose, and can operate with signals up to±10 v with drift rates dependent upon the stored voltage but typically less than 7 mv/hr."
"A piezoelectric microinjector which utilizes the expansion of a ceramic cylinder into a surrounding cavity was used for injections of glucose-6-P, Na+ and fluorescein, Na+ into single living EL2 ascites cells. The results were assessed in a microspectrofluorometer by fluorescein emission or NAD(P)H fluorescence associated with glucose-6-P metabolism. With micropipettes exhibiting an orifice of about ~0.5 , μ, application of an electrical field on the ceramic transducer element may initiate an instantaneous efflux of solution, but the pressure which builds up in the system will result in a prolonged drip. Therefore, the amount injected in a cell will be a function of previous voltage increases and the staying time in the cell, rather than the instantaneous voltage increment. Quantitative injection is possible with larger pipette orifices. Despite the difficulties associated with high tip resistance, the piezoelectcic microinjector opens the way to the intracellular addition of fluorescent and chemiluminescent enzyme mixtures, through smaller micropipette tips (e.g., ~0.5 μ), better tolerated by the average mammalian cell in culture."
"A circuit to remove an offset from a signal is described. The circuit uses a simple digital memory to store the offset, and the output is the difference between this stored offset and the input signal. The drift is small, the bandwidth wide, and the input voltage may be obtained in digital form."
"A minimum-time, fixed energy strategy for running a circular track on a windy day is derived which expresses velocity and acceleration as simple trigonometric functions of the runner's position on the track. Rather surprisingly, the strategy directs the runner to begin accelerating when the wind is directly in his face and decelerating with the wind directly at his back."
"A percutaneous wire electrode has been developed which permits long-term recording of intramuscular EMG signals. The electrode consists of a small coil wound from 0.0011 inch diameter wire and filled with silicone rubber. Easily inserted by means of a hypodermic needle, it has demonstrated reliable EMG recording for periods of up to thirteen months."
"The influences of phase shifts are extremely important in the determination of filtered waveforms and therefore in the interpretation of many biosignals. Low frequency shifts from high pass filtering, for example, are significant because large time displacements result from small phase deviations in the vicinity of the corner frequency. If a filter with a symmetric time response is employed, no phase shift will ensue. The time symmetry in this example is achieved with a tape recorder, first recording a high pass filtered signal and then playing back with time reversal to a second recorder through the high pass filter again. Real time processing is not achievable."
"This communication presents a classroom procedure for minimizing the error between simulated data and experimental data to obtain the ``best'' parameters for a given system model. It is hoped that such experience helps in the process of biological model building and brings out the advantages of different types of simulations used for model improvement."
"This communication describes a new method of manufacturing tungsten microelectrodes with finer tip size and more reproducible exposed recording area than has been previously achieved. The tips are dc electroetched to diameters below 500 A and completely covered with polymethyl methacrylate. An electron beam from a scanning electron microscope is then used to expose a precise area on the tip for later removal by chemical methods. Recording results with these electrodes suggest very good isolation properties."
"Although the functional electrical stimulation orthosis is one of the most recent approaches to the rehabilitation of hemiplegic patients, the quantitative estimate of its influence on the patients walking is not satisfactorily solved. In this communication the variables necessary for gait evaluation are defined and two quantitative methods for their interpretation are given. The second method was tested on eight hemiplegic patients. The results show the applicability of the described techniques of evaluation."
"A voltage to frequency converter suitable for telemetric applications of strain gage pressure transducers is described and analyzed. The circuit uses a voltage reference IC and a temperature dependent op amp bias current to achieve zero pressure offsets less than 3 torr over a 25°C temperature range and a 1 volt supply voltage range."
"Bowel sounds were recorded under standard conditions for 30 minutes before, and for 90 minutes after a standard meal in 12 healthy human volunteers. The sounds were analyzed with the aid of a computer, and the evolution in time of specific parameters obtained as a quantitative printout. The number, total duration, and mean energy of sounds totaled for ten minute periods were found to be markedly influenced by the ingestion of the meal. A peak of activity occurred immediately after the meal; the activity then decreased to 85% of premeal value 60 minutes later, and a second peak followed after a further 60 minutes. An excellent correlation (correlation coefficient better than 0.9) was found at two recording sites between the three analyzed parameters, taken in pairs. For any given parameter, a correlation was also found between its value at the two sites (k better than 0.9),but the actual value were significantly different (p <0.001). When bowel sounds are interpreted, therefore, food ingestion should be taken into consideration."
"The diffusion membrane catheter coupled to the mass spectrometer has previously been used to measure partial pressures of gases in blood. However, measurement errors arise due to depletion of gases in the vicinity of the catheter. The nature of these errors in oxygen and argon partial pressure measurement is described for in vitro and in vivo studies. The in vitro setup consisted of a catheter having a silicone or Teflon membrane at its tip and located within a tube surrounded by flowing blood or water. The effects of tube diameter and bulk fluid flow rate on mass spectrometer readings of oxygen and argon partial pressures were examined. It was found that a log-linear relationship closely described the effect of flow rate on readings in the region of flow dependence. Also flow dependence for argon closely paralleled that for oxygen. The in vivo study which followed was an examination of the errors in mass spectrometer readings under conditions which cause varying flow rates in blood vessels. Substantial errors in oxygen readings were found which could be compensated for by using argon readings as a correction factor."
"The serial correlation coefficients are used to estimate the degree of dependence in inter-pulse interval sequences. The effect of measurement errors (i.e., one pulse missing or one extra pulse artificially generated) on the value of the coefficients is determined. The theory indicates that simple rules for correction exist and that a bestguess conversion from damaged pulse train to undamaged version can be performed by graphical means."

"The distribution of the heating potential inside a lossy sphere having the same electrical characteristics as those of brain tissue was investigated in the frequency region of 10 MHz to 12 GHz. The conditions under which a potential hot spot appears inside the sphere and its shape were determined and were displayed in a radius vs. frequency diagram. The results show that hot spots appear inside only for spheres with radii 8 cm > R > 0.1 cm and only in the frequency range of 300 < f < 12,000 MHz. It was found that the heating potential is always non-uniformly distributed, and in cases where it was maximum inside the sphere it was larger by a factor of approximately ten to the values calculated by the plane slab or the average cross section model."
"The character of transient electric fields induced in spherical homogeneous tissue models of man and animals by incident electromagnetic fields similar to that originating from lightning and EMP generators has been theoretically determined. The magnitude of the induced fields is found to be approximately proportional to the time rate of change of the incident field and independent of the pulsewidth. It was also found that maximum EMP induced field in spherical shaped bodies is nearly proportional to the radius of the body. Therefore, for EMP safety standards, more consideration should be given to the time rate of change of the incident field rather than to the pulsewidth, and when laboratory animal data are used as a guide they should be extrapolated to account for body size."
"The interaction of electromagnetic plane waves with multilayered spherical models composed of lossy dielectric media that represent different biological tissues found in human and animal heads is examined in the frequency range 0.1 to 10 GHz. The model ranges in size from 2 to 12.5 cms outer radius and consists of a core of brain-like material surrounded by five outer layers of CSF, bone, fat and skin-dura tissues. The absorption properties of the model have been analyzed throughout this range of size and frequency. The distribution of internally deposited energy has also been investigated in detail for three basic spheres of 3.3, 6 and 10 cms radii, with emphasis on the creation of localized regions of strong heating (hot-spots). Based on these results, some generalized conclusions are presented on the interaction of microwaves with different sized biological objects."
"The problems associated with measuring the local electric field in a medium with spatally inhomogeneous electrical constitutive parameters like biological tissue are discussed. Simple theoretical analyses that describe the operation of electrically short bare and insulated electric field probes in a dissipative medium are presented. The conditions that must be satisfied for each of these probes to have an electric field response that is independent of the electrical constitutive parameters of the surrounding tissue are determined. The results of a systematic experimental study of both types of probes are presented. In the study the probes were immersed in a succession of liquids with dielectric properties similar to those for biological tissues at radio frequencies."
"Electrocardiographic data compression via orthogonal transform processing is studied using canine ECG data. The Haar transform and the discrete cosine transform are considered. While the basis vectors for the Haar transform are sampled rectangular waves, those for the discrete cosine transform are sampled sinusoids."
"This paper examines the feasibility of utilizing statistical constraints on the inverse potential model to determine the potential distribution over a 4 cm sphere surrounding the heart from perturbed torso potentials. These perturbed torso potentials reflect instrumentation, quadrature, electrode placement, and heart position uncertainties. This work is an extension of the authors' previous work which concluded that it is not feasible to determine this same potential distribution using unconstrained solutions. However, the results of the present work indicate that with the use of approximate signal and noise covariance matrices, it is possible to achieve estimates of this potential distribution with an average sum squared error of twenty-five percent. Further, the estimation of the signal and noise covariance matrices can be accomplished with a knowledge of heart geometry, torso geometry, The approximate measurement error, and a rough estimate of the time an average section of myocardium is depolarized, but without an a priori specification of the activation sequence."
"The affinity of norepinephrine for the α-adrenergic receptor in rabbit thoracic aorta is determined by three different methods. The first method assumes that the effect is directly proportional to receptor occupancy from which affinity is computed from the A50. The second method is a null method and employs a prior partial blockade, assuming only that equal effects imply equal receptor occupancy without making the direct proportion assumption. The third method is a new ``relaxation'' method in which the equilibrium is upset by a transient perturbation with UV radiation, and the kinetics of the restoration process are analyzed, from which not only affinity, but both forward and reverse rate constants are determined. Affinity constants determined by the ``null'' and ``relaxation'' methods are in agreement, while the affinity constant determined by A50 is low. The nature of the photo-induced relaxation is discussed along with the basis for extending the relaxation method to other drug-effector combinations."
"The purpose of this investigation was to delineate the effect of imposed mean pressure levels on the open-loop dynamic response characteristics of the carotid sinus baroceptors in dogs. The experimental design consisted of measuring the intrasinus pressure and the gross baroceptor nerve activity while forcing the isolated sinus with sinusoidal pulse pressures, with peak-to-peak amplitude of 50 mm Hg, superimposed on mean pressures of 75, 125, 175, and 225 mm Hg at frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 15 and 20 Hz. With this forcing protocol, we were able to divide the traditional sigmoidal pressurenerve activity relationship into three piecewise linear segments whose input-output (transfer) functions could then be determined by conventional linear system analysis. We found that (a) at each mean pressure level, the transfer function relating nerve activity, N(s), to forcing pressure, P(s), was second order and of the form, N(s)/P(s) = α(1 + ßs + γs2), and (b) the coefficients α, Β, and γ were all quadratic functions of the mean pressure level, P Incorporating the equations for each coefficient as a function of mean pressure into the transfer function yielded the nonlinear differential equation, N(t) = kΑ(P) [(P(t) - P) + ß(P) (dp(t)/dt) + γ(P) (d2P(t)/dt2)], which describes the dynamic response of the carotid sinus baroceptor nerve, N(t), over the entire pressure range, P(t), studied."
"The dispersion of the cardiovascular control system variables of heart period, systolic and diastolic blood pressure in a group of resting essential hypertensives has been compared with a group of normotensive subjects. Controlled variable dispersion in the absence of external perturbation was considered to be a measure of short term cardiovascular control system offset (error) from reference values (setpoint). The high blood pressure group demonstrated a greatly decreased controlled variable dispersion compared with the normal, implying the operation of a control system having a high closed loop gain, low system error and poor stability secondary to perturbation or stress. The extent of the changes in control system performance in essential hypertension was reduced by the adrenergic neuron blocking agent, guanethidine. These conclusions are consistent with and are discussed in relation to the known dynamic responses of heart rate and blood pressure to stress, together with the pathophysiology of the forward and feedback pathways of the cardiovascular control system, in essential hypertension."
"The electric field associated with two disks on the surface of a semi-infinite isotropic homogeneous medium is found on a plane perpendicular to the disks and passing through their centers. To an accuracy which is primarily determined by the finite dimensions of the electrolytic tank, the solution is presented as families of curves. In this presentation, the magnitude of the electric field (normalized in terms of the distance of the field point from the surface, conductivity of the medium, and applied power) and the angular orientation of the field vector are plotted as functions of the ratios of the linear dimensions which characterize the geometry of the system to the distance of the field point from the surface."
"The accurate categorization of profusion of opacities in radiographs of coal workers is a significant medical problem. In this study, the feasibility of computer classification of profusion was investigated. Standard pattern recognition techniques were used except for the spatial moments which were computed as measurements of the texture patterns. A normal-abnormal classification was performed on 178 zonal samples and resulted in a training classification rate of 99% and a testing rate of 97%. A four category classification was also performed for the zonal samples with a correct classification rate of 84%. The zonal decisions were used to obtain overall film profusion. The results of this classification compared favorably with readings by radiologists. This study provides positive evidence for a quantitative approach to the classification of profusion. The significance of this study with respect to the understanding and measurement of lung pathology from radiographs is that an alternative or supplement to the presently used visual analysis is demonstrated."
"A spectrophotometer for the direct determination of sample extinction by simultaneous measurement at three wavelengths and application of Allen's correction has been developed. White light is passed, first through a blue heat filter, and then through the sample and finally through a trichromator which selects the required three wavelengths. These wavelengths illuminate the base region of three FPT 100 type photo diodes which operate as linear transducers converting the incident light intensity to a current which is converted to a voltage in head amplifiers. A computation sub-unit together with a logarithmic amplifier generate the function required for the Allen correction, and the corrected extinction value is displayed digitally on neon display tubes."
"Employing a Wheatstone bridge, skin conductance was measured over those putative acupuncture points on the large intestine and pericardium meridians lying between the metacarpophalangeal joints and the elbow. Results were compared to those from anatomically similar locations devoid of acupuncture points. At most acupuncture points on most subjects, there were greater electrical conductance maxima than at control sites."
"A simple function generator for generating complex waveforms with adjustable repetition rate, suitable for biomedical applications is described. This generator may be used for simulating the typical output waveforms of electro-medical equipment such as ECG, EEG, etc., and for generating optimal complex waveforms required for neurophysiological and behavioral studies. The instrumentation proposed here is based on the so-called ``n-phase astable multivibrator.''"
"Experiments using a parallel plate waveguide as the measurement medium have revealed a strong dependence of RF absorption in rats and biological-phantom prolate spheroidal bodies upon the frequency and polarization of electromagnetic fields. The results correlate well to those of free space irradiation. Strongest power deposition is observed for fields polarized along the long dimension of the bodies for frequencies such that the major length is about one-quarter wavelength of radiation. At resonance, an effective absorption area of 2.5 to 3.5 times the shadow cross section is measured."
"Power deposition at the implant and elsewhere inside a head model during inductive thermocoagulation procedures has been studied. A quasistatic approximation is employed to estimate the absorbed power. The model consists of a small solid metallic cylinder implanted inside a homogeneous brain sphere. Results indicate that absorption by the brain is a strong function of location. The implant power absorption is at least two orders of magnitude greater than the rest of the head. The predicted magnetic field squared dependence of the implant power deposition agrees well with reported experimental observations."

"Dielectric films, strips and ribs on transparent substrates serve as wave-guides in planar optics. Made of materials suitable for integration of lines and components into microscopic circuits they are preferably monomode and have less than 1 dB/cm loss. Cladded core and gradient glass fibres transmit optical signals over wide distances with low loss and distortion. High silica content fibres have as little as 1 dB/km loss and broaden laser pulses by less than 1 ns/km."
"It is not the intention of this paper to give a complete coverage of all new radar and navigation systems, but to concentrate rather more on specific areas and examples where microwaves are used. Also, general coverage of the radar area is felt to be unnecessary following the invited paper given by R. Voles at Microwave 74, however recent advances in solid state microwave devices and integrated circuits have made possible some new types of radars with novel applications, particularly in the low power low price sector. After a reminder of some basic radar relationships examples are given, and future possibilities discussed. Aircraft navigation and landing systems are then considered, with emphasis on the various microwave landing systems currently being assessed for future ILS replacement. Ground and air-derived systems, mechanical and electrical scanning beams, Doppler scanning, and passive angle sensors are mentioned. Navigation on land and sea will also be covered, although non-microwave systems will only be mentioned in passing. Where possible, indications of unsolved problems will be given; in particular collision avoidance systems for road vehicles will be discussed."
"In this paper we present the current status of subnanosecond pulse technology and its various applications. Specifically, we will discuss the application of baseband technology to the test and calibration of microwave components and the measurement of the intrinsic properties of materials, to the development of a new class of low-cost radars for docking and safety use, and to the time-domain multiplexing of data in computing systems. The paper will include a review of waveform generation and antenna radiation and reception methods together with a description of baseband receiver technology."
"The theoretical design of splash plate feed systems, where a reflecting plate is situated in front of a radiating aperture, is discussed. Several configurations are investigated and the results compared with experimental data."
"The coaxial feed for front-fed paraboloidal antennas as known from previous papers, by which an increase of aperture efficiency and a decrease of spillover is achieved, was simplified considerably in construction and improved in bandwidth. The aperture field distribution of the feed, which is necessary for an approximately sector-shaped rotationally symmetric feed pattern, is achieved by the excitation and superposition of H12-, E11- and H11-modes, however, the modes are different from those superimposed in earlier constructions. The modes are excited by aperture coupling and the means of excitation are explained. The feed dimensioning was optimized experimentally. The aperture efficiency of paraboloids with these feeds will be reported."
"Special dielectric antennas used as elements for a feed of multi-beam or limited-scan reflector antennas have been developed. As a result of the close arrangement of the feed elements, their cross-sectional dimensions must be small and their mutual coupling should be as low as possible. On the other hand, the individual elements must produce a desired reflector illumination. The design and the radiation characteristics of the dielectric antennas developed are discussed in detail. Furthermore, a report is given on theoretical and experimental investigations, which were performed to obtain a low VSWR of these antennas in a wide frequency band."
"The use of corrugated waveguide as feeders for microwave antennas is discussed. They offer the advantage of a potentially lower attenuation than smooth wall circular waveguides. As circular corrugated waveguide feeders are slightly overmoded, we describe results showing that the mode conversion due to bends has negligible affect on the dominant mode radiation pattern. We also discuss a means to provide continual mode suppression. Finally, the cross-polarisation properties of corrugated waveguides are found to be intrinsically superior to those of smooth wall waveguides when the waveguide wall suffers elliptical deformation."
"This paper presents a method for optimally designing the subreflector of a Cassegrain antenna for maximum efficiency while maintaining a low V.S.W.R. level. This is accomplished by setting up a composite performance criterion which explicitly includes both the efficiency and the power reflected back into the feed. Gradient search procedures are then used to find the subreflector shape to maximise this criterion. Broad band design is possible simply by integrating the criterion over the required frequency interval. Theoretical and experimental results are given for a small two-reflector antenna."
"A new procedure is described, intended for system calibration and systematic error removal in automated S-parameter measurements. The new procedure uses only three non-critical reference standards, called the \"Through\", the \"Short\" and the \"Delay\" and leads to a set of equations for which a fast, non-iterative, explicit solution is known."
"The determination of microwave transistor s-parameter over a frequency band up to ≃ lOGHz by means of Time Domain Techniques, involving Fourier analysis and deconvolution of transient response data, is described and compared with network analyzer techniques. A method for the extraction of active device parameters from measurements on packaged devices is presented."
"The f.m. noise of a microwave oscillator is discriminated with the combination of a circulator and a high-Q reflection type cavity and detected in a balanced mixer. The L.O.-signal for the mixer is also derived from the oscillator under test. The resonator can be frequency modulated with a small ferrite insert. With a constant current input to the ferrite coil, the frequency deviation is flat for modulation frequencies up to 600 kHz and over a 10% microwave frequency range. The frequency modulation capability of the resonator is used for an automatic calibration of the f.m. noise of the microwave oscillator under test. An experimental prototype of this system operating at X-band has a limiting sensitivity of 0.01 Hz/ √Hz above 1 kHz from the carrier frequency."
"We describe a novel Josephson device made from a section of superconducting (niobium) coaxial line and from thin superconducting (lead) membrane mounted perpendicularly to line axis. The membrane makes good galvanic contact with the outer coaxial conductor and forms a circumferential Josephson junction with the (oxidized) center conductor. This configuration as compared to the traditional planar one couples better to microwave fields and is self-screened against magnetic disturbances. The device has the stability of a good permanently-adjusted point-contact and, so far, exhibits only weak-link type Josephson behaviour. Lack of true tunnelling is attributed to imperfect surface finish of the central conductor. The device has been successfully tested as broadband detector at 78 GHz."
"Design and performance of very high pulse power monitors based on the thermoelectric effects of hot carriers in a semiconductor placed in the microwave electric field gradient is described. Principle of operation of the devices is presented with the special attention paid to semiconductor material choice and some particular design problems. The results of measurements of S and X-band power monitors are given up to 1 MW and 100 KW respectively. Thermoelectric voltage of hot carriers is not sensitive to ambient temperature changes from - 40 to + 60°C. No aging effects during 6 month period were detected."
"A new element is described which is useful in array antennas. This element has a circular symmetric radiation pattern, controllable beamwidth, and exhibits extremely low mutual coupling between elements in the array. A modification of this antenna element results in a single antenna having equal E- and H-plane patterns, no side lobes and extremely low back radiation."
"The radiation resistance of an open-circuit microstrip termination is to a good approximation, a simple function of the strip width thus suggesting a straightforward yet effective means of element control when used in a large array; furthermore the array bandwidth can be controlled to some extent. The design of linear and two dimensional resonant arrays based on this design procedure is formulated and examples at X and J band are outlined; the beamwidths and sidelobe levels are of the order ± 4.5° and -16dB respectively. The extension of the new technique to travelling wave arrays, circular polarisation and various substrates is under investigation and will be mentioned; computational aspects throughout will be discussed."
"This paper describes the design and testing of an active phased array element for both transmit and receive operation. Emphasis is placed on cost reduction since many elements will be used in a complete active array. A single solid-state source is used both to generate the transmitted signal and to act as a local oscillator on reception. Frequency stability is obtained by locking the source to a stable reference from a master oscillator for the array. Limits to performance are discussed together with presentatation of results for a 1OGHz element using either a Gunn or Impatt device as the source."
 "We present an experimental study of the radiation characteristics of a plane equiangular 4-arm spiral antenna with a conical reflector, isolated in the first case. The centre of the spiral is confused with the apex of the cone (with varying angle). A compromise between gain and bandwidth is given. The optimized antenna is then fitted into a cylindrical cavity. When the spiral is on a level with the aperture of the cavity, the antenna is frequency-independant for a 1 : 2.66 bandwidth. When the spiral is included in the cavity, the antenna radiates as a circular aperture for a 1 : 1.71 bandwidth. Eθ and Eϕ radiating patterns are equal. The antenna is no more frequency-independant. Isolated or embedded the realized antennas possess circular polarization and very good revolutionnary symmetry. Measurements of the current on the arms of the spiral allow the explanation of all results."
"A three terminal avalanche device is considered operating in a Trapatt type of circuit. A simplified theory is presented which suggests that good efficiencies over 30% can be obtained with bandwidths in excess of 50% and power gains around 10 dB. Experiments on a low frequency transistor show electronic gains of 16 dB caused by avalanche multiplication but `second breakdown' limits the duration of any pulsed operation. Trapatt type waveforms are exhibited across the output though voltage swings are insufficient at present to give good efficiency."
"A new principle for wideband attenuators is presented: The attenuator consists of power dividers, 90-degree phase shifters, and PIN-diodes. The power reflected at the diodes is absorbed by the isolation resistors of one of the power dividers. A new technique for phase shifters is presented: Allpass meander line networks of low order have been developed and used instead of conventional phase shifters. Equivalent circuits with well known properties have made it straight-forward to calculate the allpass conditions. Multilayer technique has been avoided by the use of meander lines. Experimental verification: An experimental stripline device covering 2-7.2 GHz with a VSWR of less than 1.85 is shown. Another device, also in stripline, covers 6-18 GHz with a VSWR of less than 2.15. The results are in good agreement with the theory presented."
"A hybrid-coupled 4-phase P.I.N. diode modulator can operate at frequencies as high as the upper Ku-band even on 25 mil alumina. Investigated are the theoretical constraints under which hybrid-coupled phase modulators, may be connected in series. It is shown, that large output reflexion coefficients are admissible for the series connection of such modulators. The theoretical results have been verified by measurements, which showed that with an optimized design, a single modulator will accept any load with 20 % reflexion coefficient and produce less than ± 2° phase error without using isolators; even at 50 % load reflexion coefficient it will not produce inadmissible large phase errors. With fast enough switching diodes, the 4-phase modulator will accept bit rates in excess of 200 Mbit/s. Excepting the P.I.N. diode chips, this modulator, including the complete bias networks, is manufactured photolithographically, thus allowing a economical production of the device."
"In guided millimeter-wave communication systems with high bit-rate the PCM is done in a reflection-type phase modulator with pin-diode. In this contribution the influence of the pin-diode switching transients on the modulator behaviour is studied both, experimentally and theoretically. Using sampling oscilloscope techniques the transient impedance was measured for various i-layer widths, dc-switching current ratios and microwave powers. The results are compared to theoretical ones obtained by an approximate charge-control model of the pin-diode."
"A new sampling line with series gates is suited for both fast signal recording and fast pulse generation up to 10 Gbit/s as found in experimental results. It consists of a delay line with equidistantly inserted switches (in practice Schottky diodes). The spatial voltage distribution of a signal passing the delay line can discretely be stored on the delay line sections when the switches are opened e.g. simultaneously. The sampling line may function as a pulse or word generator, too. For that purpose the open ended delay line sections are charged to the amplitudes of a wanted output pulse shape before closing the switches. In order to achieve continuous signal recording resp. continuous pulse generation several paralleled sampling lines may operate successively, offering very promising ways to realize ultra high speed demultiplexers and multiplexers and a baseband repeater for the Gbit/s range."
 "The design procedure will be analysed for a reflection type amplifier and a transistor amplifier from a circuit engineer's point of view. That is to say after an appropriate choice of the active device for the required application, the method of characterization for computer assisted design procedure will be analysed. Essentially an exploration is needed of the impedance or S-parameter in at least 4 dimensions (for the variables, frequency, added power, bias and temperature for instance). The choice of the circuit can then be made by optimization procedures which includes an optimised topographical search. Finally a survey of current possibilities in Avalanche Gunn, Baritt, Tunnel diodes and F.E.T. transistors will be given (noise, power bandwidth intermodulation, etc...) with examples of amplifiers with the latest performances that have been realised in the world for different applications. These include low noise applications for receiver preamplifiers, driver stages and output power stages. This survey will attempt to be as general as possible indicating the different technologies that are currently used with their advantages and limitations."
"Possible systems for stabilization of a solid state microwave oscillator using a high Q-resonator, as the reaction and the transmission systems (including the Kurokawa system) are considered from a common theoretical point of view. This is achieved by using the scattering matrix representation of a resonant waveguide junction with four output leads, one of which is coupled to a \"generator\" containing the active device. Conditions are found, that have to be imposed on the circuit and the device impedance locus to obtain a large stability and stabilization range. Is is found that for use in microstrip technique the transmission system is most suitable in view of the much larger stabilization range. The construction of an Impatt oscillator in microstrip technique, which is intended for use in a 20 GHz relay system, is described and measuring results are reported."
"A nonlinear theory of multiple-frequency oscillators of the negative resistance type is developed and applied to two-frequency Gunn- and Impattdiode oscillators. The following results which were confirmed by measurements are obtained: By a high-Q loading of the second circuit a considerable improvement in the FM-noise spectrum at the fundamental frequency is achieved. The locking bandwidth is nearly twice that of a (sub-) harmonically synchronized single-frequency oscillator. The same is true for the frequency range of FM-noise reduction."
"Monte Carlo techniques have been applied for the first time in the calculation of hot noise in multivalleyed GaAs taking various possible scattering mechanisms into account. A. M. noise (DSB)to carrier ratio and r.m.s. frequency deviation as well as F. M. noise (DSB) to carrier ratio are hence computed over the sideband range 1-100 MHz of a cavity controlled Gunn type oscillation for Quenched and Delayed Domain modes by adopting a phenomenological model proposed by Middleton. The results exhibit trends in fair agreement with available experimental work."
"An ultrastable, low-noise, low-cost, fixed-frequency, S-band transistor frequency source controlled by a metallized glass cavity has been computer optimized. Frequency and temperature stabilities of 0.9 × 10-9 parts/hour and 1.8 × 10-7 parts/°C, respectively, have been achieved. A C-band, tunable, IMPATT diode frequency source with 8 × 10-8 parts/hour stability, excellent tuning accuracy, and a very clean frequency spectrum is also described. These results demonstrate that glass cavity-controlled frequency sources present a viable alternative to the more complex, expensive frequency synthesizer. This approach can also favorably provide tunable sources in the X-, Ku-, or Ka-band, and fixed-frequency sources using GaAs FET devices up to X-band."
"Temperature stabilisation was obtained by combining two dielectrics with opposite temperature coefficients of dielectric permittivity to a composite resonator. Single crystals of LiNb03 were used as the part with positive coefficient, while the other part consisted of especially developed ceramics. S-band resonators of both \"sandwich\"- and \"coaxial\" type were made with Qo-values of 5000 - 6000 and an effective ε = 54-59, which is higher than any ε-value previously obtained for temperature compensated dielectrics. Resonators with a resulting temperature coefficient of frequency 1/f (df/dT) = 6 - 8 ppm/°C in the range of 10 - 50°C were tested with CW-power up to 80 W with very satisfying results."
"A new technique of microwave power generation using the phase-locked loop principle is described. It combines the functions of a microwave up-converter and a microwave power amplifier and is therefore particularly attractive for heterodyne-type radio relay transmitters. Power up-conversion is accomplished by phase-locking the output signal of a voltage-controlled microwave power oscillator to the angle-modulated i.f. signal. The phase comparison is done at the intermediate frequency with a down-converted sample of the VCO signal. A theoretical analysis and experimental results with transistor and GUNN-VCOs indicate an overall transmitter performance comparable to that obtained with a conventional up-converter-amplifier configuration with the advantage of much less complex microwave circuitry."
"Two phase locked transistor and Gunn diode oscillators have been developed at S and X band respectively as building blocks of a microwave synthesizer for on-board space applications. Each VCO is locked to a single reference source by means of a wideband control module, that has been made in hybrid technology on G-l0 epoxy and teflon-fiberglass substrates. The reference signal is provided to both the PLL circuits by a proper master oscillator, whose frequency is controlled by an oven contained quartz crystal. All circuits, except the transferred electron oscillator, make use only of components, that are qualified for space applications."
"A range resolution of ± 2.5 mm has been obtained with a FMCW radar and a sophisticated signal processing. The system operates at X-band with 1.5 GHz frequency sweep. It makes use of the fact, that the total phase length ΔΦ of the IF waveform produced by superposition of the transmitted and reflected FMCW signal is an exact measure of the distance, if reflections of only one target are present. The measurement of the total phase length is performed by counting the zeros of m subsequent IF pulses, while the start phase of each pulse is changed in steps of 2/πm. This procedure results in an accuracy of the ΔΦ measurement ≤ 2π/m. The signal processing is realized by a combination of a single-sideband mixer and a low frequency modulator followed by digital electronics."
"By recording and reconstructing several microwave holograms of the same object at different frequencies, and superposition of the complex amplitude of the reconstruced images in an appropriate manner, the resolving power can considerably be improved. Experiments in the 8-12 GHz region are presented with simple objects. The reconstruction is done numerically on a digital computer."
"A microwave scanning microscope capable of detecting and locating defects in a metal surface is described. Using a technique to obtain super-resolution, previously described, the instrument has proved capable of resolving gratings with periods of λ/200, and of detecting fatigue cracks less than 2μ in width."
"New systems for current measurement in HV DC and HV AC transmission are described. The systems utilize the YIG-tuned devices placed in close vicinity of the HV line conductor as a magnetic field sensor. The output signal of the system is proportional to the resonant frequency of the YIG sphere in the YIG-tuned device. This resonant frequency is linearly dependent on the magnetic field created by current to be measured. The system consists of two basic parts, a high potential unit placed at the HV line conductor and a ground potential unit. These both parts are connected by microwave link which provides necessary isolation. The block diagrams of the systems and some of the investigation results are given."
"The circuit of a moisture content - attenuation - voltage converter in the form of a microwave attenuation comparator is presented in the paper. Time-domain discrimination of the measuring and reference signals has been applied. Independence between the measurements results and the phase relations in the sensor as well as the microwave elements parameters unstability has been assured. A special direct-coupled d.c.amplifier has been interconnected between comparators output and signal level meter. A 0,001 dB resolution and 0,01 dB long-term stability within a measured attenuation range of 20 dB has been achieved."
"Optimal design criteria for millimeter-wave cavity-type spectrometers, used in the measurement of molecular spectra, have been derived. Using an optimally designed spectrometer, the technique of molecular spectroscopy offers a highly sensitive and specific experimental research method for studying chemical kinetics and for monitoring gaseous pollutants and constituents of interest in pollution research. The method is also suitable for the study of the molecular properties of short-lived transient chemical species with lifetimes as short as one millisecond or less. Since the sensitivity of the spectrometer is determined by the total noise introduced during the processes of microwave generation, absorption in the resonant cavity, and the detection and amplification of a spectral line signal, the spectrometer has been analyzed and optimized in detail with respect to the equivalent noise temperatures associated with these processes. The conclusions drawn from the optimum design criteria are applied in the design of a tunable high-Q resonant cavity spectrometer operating at 70 GHz."
"A simple and precise method of complex refractive index meaurements in the submillimeter range has been elaborated. As a source of radiation in the quasioptical interferometer we use a swept carcinotron. The method combines the advantages of usual Fourier transform spectrometry and interferometers with coherent sources of radiation: there is no uncertainty in the order of interferometric maximum or minimum, the error connected with multi-reflection in the sample and in the space between generator and receiver is almost completely eliminated. The complex refractive indexes of some polymers, ferrites and amsotropic crystals were measured. A high dichroism in crystals of TGS and TGSe was observed."
"Microstrip pulsed TRAPATT oscillators using devices designed for S-band have been operated in the fundamental and second harmonic extraction modes to give efficient high power operation at S and C-band frequencies. Conversion efficiencies of greater than 30% in the fundamental mode at 2.5 GHz and 10% in the second harmonic mode at 5 GHz have been achieved. Both planar and mesa device structures have been used to achieve TRAPATT operation at current densities in excess of 10 kA.cm-2 without the problems of premature burn out. A pulse duty cycle of 1000:1 was used. The importance of low loss parasitic diode resistance for efficient operation at high current levels is demonstrated. Finally, a frequency injection locking techniques is employed to overcome the frequency chirp of the free running oscillator and locking gains in excess of 20 dB are reported."
"The system application of a pulse-modulated transmitter chain using a microwave power combiner with 8 to 16 IMPATT diodes is described. Modulation and thermal considerations are discussed and some test results presented."
"The transferred-electron effect on high efficiency IMPATT avalanche diodes characterized by non punch-through structures is investigated. It is shown that the high (greater that 30%) output efficiencies, experimentally obtained with GaAs non punch-through IMPATT devices, are only possible due to the specific features of the electron velocity versus electric field dependence in this material. Some experimental results are given which corroborate the theoretical conclusions. Based on this new understanding, suggestions are made for further improvement of IMPATT performance."
"Anomalously high efficiencies have been observed in GaAs avalanche diode structures - approaching twice that predicted for the ideal Read diode. The physical mechanisms which contribute to this observed efficiency enhancement, namely depletion layer width modulation and accelerated carrier flow, are described in this paper. The principles are established using a sharp pulse model, and the discussion is extended to consider the implications for broad pulses. The validity of the analytical approaches is then assessed by comparing the results of analysis with those of a computer simulation of the device, including all the relevant device physics."
"By considering the loss of a practical millimetre-wave oscillator circuit, the variation of oscillator power with diode area for a constant junction temperature rise is examined, the results being scaled from measurements on a known device. It is concluded that the diode area for optimum oscillator power is a function of junction temperature rise and thus diodes for reliable oscillators will have different design criteria from devices giving the more spectacular results. Results are presented for silicon single and double-drift and gallium arsenide single drift IMPATT diodes over the 30-60 GHz range."
 "A method for determining the accuracy of computed impedance and wavelength data for microstrip is proposed. It is shown that the standard equations of Wheeler and Schneider have rather large errors. Revised equations for microstrip impedance and wavelength are given both for analysis and synthesis with accuracy better than 1%. A simple, accurate equation for the microstrip open circuit is presented. Experimental data on microstrip T-junctions are compared with existing theories. A new accurate equation is given for the reference plane displacement in the stub arm. Corrections are proposed in the existing equations for the other parameters of the equivalent circuit."
"\"Sandwich\" slot-line and original slot-line are investigated by an approximate waveguide treatment. The analytic solutions obtained yield the dispersion diagram of fundamental and higher order modes on these structures. Knowledge of the modes functions permits to derive, like-T.E.M. impedance characteristic and attenuation for each mode."
"The properties and applications of asymmetric uniformly coupled line structures in an inhomogeneous medium (e.g., microstrip, suspended substrate and broad side-coupled strips in a layered medium) are presented in terms of the self and mutual line constants characterizing the coupled lines. The structures are investigated in terms of the immittance and ABCD parameters derived for two port and multiport structures. These structures are useful for many applications including filters, directional couplers and impedance matching networks."
"The Getzinger's model [1]for dielectric microstrip lines is extended to wide ferrite microstrips magnetized perpendicularly to the ground plane. In particular it is applied to the case of edge guided wave[2] propagation. For the first time a quantitative evaluation of the fringing field effects in edge guided wave MIC circuits is presented. Experimental results are presented which show that perfect magnetic wall boundary conditions, although appropriate to volume wave propagation in isotropic wide microstrips are not valid for edge guided wave propagation."
"Two power MESFET device structures capable of providing in excess of 1 Watt RF output power in S-band have been fabricated using established small signal MESFET technology. Power added efficiencies of 30%, gains > 8 dB and 1 dB compression powers greater than 1 Watt have been measured. The fabrication and characteristics of these devices will be described and experimental results presented. A beam lead package which makes thermal contact with the top and bottom faces of the MESFET chip will be described as will a technique for the surface thermal profiling of chips using nematic liquid crystals."
"This paper describes low power oscillators principally intended for use in MIC mixer applications. The circuits are fabricated with Plessey GAT 3 and NEC (Nippon) V244 FET's suitably packaged for use with microstrip substrates. The oscillators have been stabilized using a TE012 cavity coupled to the microstrip through an aperture in the microstrip ground plane, or alternatively by means of a solid dielectric resonator on the surface of the substrate. Very good noise performance and temperature stability have been measured. The injection-locking behaviour of the oscillators has also been studied."
"The GaAs FET is increasing in use as a high frequency, low noise amplifier. This paper presents work directed to extending the band-width and repeatability of X-band FET amplifiers by the use of lumped element techniques. Such lumped element microwave circuits offer a considerable size saving when compared to microstrip circuits. Two approaches are described - one a conventional hybrid broadband lumped amplifier and the other a monolithic amplifier. The monolithic amplifier has lumped matching components combined with the FET on the GaAs chip. These approaches have yielded three stage amplifiers having 16 dB (±1 dB) gain over the frequency range 6.5 - 12 GHz. A balanced amplifier module suitable for X-band systems is also described."
"The performance of a three-stage GaAs MESFET amplifier operating in the 11.7 to 12.2 GHz U.S. satellite communication band is characterized between 40°K and 300°K. At room temperature, the noise figure is 5.3 dB (Te=700°K) and the gain is 18 dB. By cooling to 40°K, the noise figure decreases to 1.6 dB (Te=130°K) while the gain increases to 31 dB."
"MADGE (Microwave Aircraft Digital Guidance Equipment) is a portable equipment which assists the landing of all types of aircraft at a variety of sites. It contains a digital data link operating at 5 GHz. Distance is derived in the air by measuring go-and-return time; angles are measured on the ground by passive interferometer receivers. Flight results relating to coverage and accuracy are presented."
"A new system to prevent collision accidents between cars and trains on railroad crossings is described in which microwave radiation from Gunn-diode oscillators are used to recognize obstacles. Experimental results are reported."
"The detection of obstacles on railway level-crossings is usually ensured by small radars utilizing gunn diodes or similar devices. This process is not quite safe however and it may happen that a vehicle at standstill on the railway track cannot be detected. We are studying surface wave propagation, guided by the rails using transistor transmitters at lower frequencies."
"The transfer of information from the railway network to passing locomotives is a very important factor in all systems for automatic train control. Systems with intermittent transfer of information from fixed points to the locomotives offer in addition to the information transfer the advantage of exact locating the locomotive. Thus direct train control without reply to central control points is possible. SICARID-TCL (Train Control and Locating) is such a system operating in a broadband scanning made from 2.9 to 4.05 GHz. By applying MIC-technology with integrated semiconductor chips for the microwave moduls and the latest techniques for the analogue and digital circuitry a failure rate of lower than 10-6 with an information capacity of 1013 bit at high transmission rate is achieved."
"The problem of wheel and vehicle speed measurements in automotive antiskid systems is discussed and a microwave doppler radar solution proposed. A straightforward design approach for self-mixing Gunn device radar detectors using a new current waveform approximation is presented allowing simple observation of the effects of device and circuit parameter variations on the overall performance of the detector. The operation of transferred-electron and baritt devices is compared with particular reference to sensitivity and reliability under the strict environmental conditions imposed by the application. The use and performance of fully integrated microstrip circuitry is considered in the light of the cost/performance ratios required in the motor industry, the result being a hybrid integrated circuit with the oscillator, antenna and amplifier located on the same substrate."
 "The information on microwave bioeffects /MWBE/ is derived from animal experimentation, model studies and epidemiological research on the health status of persons exposed occupationally to MW. The analysis of MWBE requires the consideration of a chain of events: biophysical mechanisms - the primary interaction, and physiological mechanisms - immediate local and generalized effects, and late effects. Animal experiments may be divided into acute high dose and chronic low dose exposures. High dose effects can be explained in terms of the field theory, non-uniform deep body heating and its physiological consequences. Such considerations are insufficient for the explanation of chronic exposure effects, particularly frequency and/or modulation dependent effects in the nervous and the hematopoietic systems. Quantum mechanical considerations constitute a promising approach. These statements are substantiated by the description of experimental systems and obtained results. Human epidemiological studies are far less informative because of their scarcity and insufficient quantitation of exposure conditions; the available data are reviewed. Practical implications for establishing permissible exposure levels and safety rules, as well as research needs are indicated."
"For the study of mm wave thermography and hazards the absorption characteristics of living human skin are determined between 8 and 95 GHz by placing the skin against a thin dielectric film suspended across a rectangular horn and measuring its return loss. The resulting absorption curve increases from 75% at 8 GHz to 95% at 96 GHz. These values are almost twice as high as compared to earlier predictions based on dielectric measurements; however, they agree fairly well with radiometric measurements and provide the basis for very sensitive mm wave thermographs."
"Methods are described for determining the electrical parameters of bound water in biological tissue from dielectric measurements made at radiowave and microwave frequencies. These parameters are then used to calculate at various frequencies the relative energy absorption in the macromolecules, bound water and free water present. It is shown that between 70 - 4000MHz the value of the energy absorbed per unit volume by the bound water is higher, and at the lower frequencies considerably higher, than for the free water. At 2450MHz the ratio of the values is about two. At 4GHz the absorption curves cross over and the effect of the free water becomes dominant at higher frequencies. Since any biological effects of microwaves are presumably due to energy absorption in the macromolecules, which are immediately adjacent to the bound water, it is clear that some frequencies are potentially more hazardous than others."
"A system has been developed for economically exposing a large portion of rodents on a long-term basis without disturbing their normal laboratory living patterns. The use of separate cells consisting of cylindrical wave-guide excited with circularly polarized guided waves provides relatively constant and easily quantifiable coupling of the fields to each animal, regardless of their position, posture, and moving patterns. The VSWR to each cell is sufficiently low that any number of cells can be coupled to a single source through a power splitter without the need for isolation circuitry."
"Two electro-optical probes have been developed which make possible the measurement of microwave power density inside biological specimens or phantoms and the continuous monitoring of temperature of the specimen during exposure to microwaves. Several ranges are available for the temperature probe. The power probe is essentially isotropic in its sensitivity to different polarizations of the electric field. The temperature probe does not perturb the microwave field nor does it cause hot spots. The same optical and electronic unit is used for both probes. These two probes provide the capability for measurements of parameters which heretofore could not be made."
"A miniature battery-operated microwave power monitor is described which operates across the threshold range of biologically dangerous power levels with approximately frequency-independent characteristics up to about 100GHz. CMOS circuitry causes an alarm signal to occur, or enables one to integrate the total microwave energy received over a given period on the basis of a thermal change of resistance in a thin Ge film due to microwave absorption."
"Since 1971, our Research department is studying dielectric probes for measuring the penetration of electromagnetic waves in not-clearly defined media. These probes call for the following technology : - dielectric light conductors - a dielectric thermo-sensitive system - an electromagnetic waves absorbing coating These devices allow measurement of power density of irradiated waves in ambient media, nearby dioptres or even near metallic conductor areas. The technics we are proposing permitted to us to reach some quite interesting characteristics which justify their use in many fields such as : - Fundamental research for the study of microwave penetration in phantoms or real media - Medical research for the control and dosimetry of radar radiations - Industry for the study and optimisation of irradiators and microwave ovens"
"The paper treats the synthesis, optimization and practical realization of a 4 GHz waveguide multiplexer composed of a WR229 straight waveguide manifold with one end shorted and dual TE111-mode Chebyshev bandpass filters arranged at intervals along the broad wall sides. The optimization process includes the filter spacings and several initial elements of each distributed filter equivalent circuit. The results of measurements performed on the breadboard model of a 4-channel multiplexer with 4-pole dual-mode filters are in good agreement with the calculated responses."
"A semi-rigid cable makes a conventional waveguide filter into an elliptic-function filter. A four-resonator elliptic-function filter having a simple construction and a selectivity equivalent to that of a ten-resonator Butterworth filter has been developed by adding a semi-rigid cable to a conventional rectangular waveguide bandpass filter. Although using semi-rigid cable, this filter is equivalent to a rectangular waveguide bandpass filter in unloaded Q. In this filter, two signal portions having passed through different routes offset each other at attenuation poles. Also, a six-resonator filter has been constructed with two semi-rigid cables."
"The design of an 11 GHz channel branching filter which has to meet high stopband attenuation requirements demonstrates that elliptic-function filters are superior to conventional filter types as regards insertion loss and size. The conctruction of a 6-section filter with couplings between non-adjacent resonators is presented. Some design rules are derived."
"A number of broadcast satellites operating in the 12 GHz band are scheduled for launch in the next decade. This paper presents a status report on a long term program aimed at advancing the technology of microwave components capable of forming the building blocks of the high power output circuits of such satellites. Designs are described and results presented on (a) devices qualified for use in a 12 GHz experimental satellite at power levels of up to 300 Watts, and (b) components currently being designed to operate in satellites with output powers up to 1 KW."
"In the lecture, the arrangement and design procedure of stripline filter is out lined. The filter having lumped capacitive II-sections as coupling elements and other parallel lumped capacitances connected to each other by very short transmission line sections. This construction can be applied for a filter with narrow relative bandwidth / e.g. maximum 25-percent/."
"A numerical method is reported for the design of filters composed of arbitrary n-microstrip structures like hairpin, meander, half-wave coupled parallel lines and more generally hybrid structures. In order to improve the design accuracy the dispersion, the losses and the dicontinuities in the structure are taken into account. The optimization routine is based on the Fletcher-Powell method with a numerical evaluation of the gradient vector of an appropriate objective function. the indipendent variables being the physical sizes of the microstrip lines."
"The known design procedures for comb line filters are applicable only to filters using TEM-mode transmission line systems. Synthesis procedures for comb line filters using coupled microstrip transmission lines must take into account the unequality of the phase velocities of the fundamental modes on such a system. Such a method is presented."
"Block phase excitation in a large phased array reduces circuit complexity and system cost but results in high side lobes in certain directions. This paper introduces a technique for determining the locations and levels of the prominent sidelobes when each phase shifter is used to control the phase of two array elements in a linear array. A steepest-descent iterative procedure ure which minimizes the high sidelobes in an optimum manner is presented. Numerical examples are given."
 "In examining the directivity characteristics of planar phased arrays, an expression in the form of a double summation approximation to the double integration of the array pattern is conventionally used. This procedure is computing time-intensive. In this paper an exact closed-form expression for the directivity function for the case in which the radiation patterns of the elements are nonidentical and nonrotational symmetrical is proposed."
"A comparison of feeding systems for Cylindrical Phased Arrays presently known shows that most of them have the serious disadvantages of complexity and relatively high losses. This is due to the requirement of controlling not only the phase, but also the amplitude distribution over the array while scanning the antenna beam. The subject of this paper is the presentation of a new feeding system for Cylindrical Phased Arrays promising especially low losses. In principle, the feeding network consists of a center-fed parallelplate transmission device where the amplitude level at the outputs is controlled by means of PIN-diodes. This configuration offers a simple method for commutating the amplitude distribution when implemented in a Cylindrical Phased Array."
"This paper deals with generation of a multibeam pattern for three-dimensional radar surveillance by a stacked feed horn system installed in a Cassegrain antenna. Although its effective f/D-ratio is relatively high compared with the corresponding one of the primarily feed paraboloid, lateral displacement of feed horns in the focal plane results in strong pattern distortion caused by phase errors in the aperture plane. Investigations show that by means of an additional axial defocusing the quadratic term of these phase errors can be compensated improving the pattern distinctly, whereas the so-called Coma side lobe remains nearly unaffected. Basing on these results a feed horn system fulfilling special requirements was optimized and constructed. The obtained multibeam pattern of the Cassegrain antenna for the receiving case and the sectoral pattern for the transmitting case are shown."
"A 14 GHZ receiver designed for OTS is shown. After a quick survey of critical specifications, pointing out which ones have got an impact on the design choice and reasons of choices are explained. A short theoretical point is discussed: how overall performances of a receiver can be deduced from performances of each part. Then technical and technological aspects of the mixer. the multiplexer. the diode and the 10w noise amplifier are discussed. Results are given showing noise figure down to 6 dB over 350 MHz bandwidth. interface problems between mixer and amplifier are briefly explained. In conclusion margin between the best laboratary measurement and acceptable specification is detailed."
 "Preamp-mixer specifications are defined by system considerations. Technological developments are described for realization of low noise millimetric mixers using chip Schottky diodes in honeycomb structure. Similar diodes can be used either in microstrip or wave-guide technology. A two stage preamplifier is computed and realized. Output preamplifier includes a wideband lumped circulator. The interconnection between mixer output and preamplifier input achieves a good matching for minimum noise figure. This quadripole can be adjusted in order to permit a possible exchange of mixer diode without damaging the general preamp-mixer characteristics."
"The design and performance of a MIC 26.5-40 GHz mixer is described. The mixer utilizes GaAs beam lead Schottky barrier diodes with a cutoff frequency of 750 GHz in a balanced arrangement with slot-line and coplanar waveguide. Conversion loss for the full waveguide band is 7.6 ± 0.5 dB with + 6 dBm LO drive. VSWRs are less than 2:1 for the RF port and 3.4:1 for the LO port. The mixer exhibits excellent LO to RF isolation, typically 25 dB and handles IF frequencies up to 8 GHz."
"A report will be given of the development of a single ended low noise down converter to convert a signal of 1 GHz bandwidth in the range of 27.55 - 28.55 GHz to an intermediate frequency of 1 - 2 GHz. The mixer, realized in waveguide form, consists of a directional filter to combine LO and signal power and a diode mount. The latter contains the mounting assembly and the matching elements of the diode. Matching is achieved by a stepped impedance transformer at the RF-input and transforming low pass filter at the IF-output. With this mixer a conversion loss of L ≈ 5 dB is attainable; this figure then is compared with theoretical predictions."
"The propagation of circularly symmetrical mode in a thin-wire cylindrical helix, inhomogeneously loaded with latching ferrite medium magnetised azimuthally to remanence is studied theoretically. Curves based on numerical solution of the characteristic equations for a variety of material and structure parameters and opposite directions of remanent flux are presented, showing the nonreciprocal behaviour of the system."
"This paper describes a general treatment of periodically-loaded ferrite phase-shifters by considering the loading essentially continuous if there are many obstacles per wavelength. Its advantage over an attempt made to treat the structure as a cascade of transmission line sections loaded by shunt susceptances is pointed out. In its generality the method can be used to analyse both cases of longitudinally- and azimuthally-magnetised ferrites. The theoretical results obtained are in general agreement with previously published experimental results."
"This paper reviews parameters for dual mode reciprocal phasers, which operate most effectively in the 5-25 GHz range. Items which receive attention include bandwidth, insertion loss, power handling, size and weight. Computed design relations are presented with some supporting experimental data."
"An X-band four-bit phase shifter capable of handling 440 watts peak power with an average transmission loss less than 1.7 dB has been constructed on a single sapphire substrate, with 8 PIN diodes as the only discrete componenets. This insertion loss is the lowest which has been acknowledged at this time for a comparable diode device. The unit has an RMS phase error less than 6.4° over a 7% band."
"A packageless PIN diode for an L-band phase shifter was designed with 1000 volt minimum measured breakdown at 10 microamperes (and estimated bulk breakdown of 1800 volts), 3 pf capacitance and 0.2 ohms. The calculated diode RF voltage stress is up to 750 volts rms in the 180° bit. Over 24,000 (180° bit) diodes have been tested to this stress level so far. A total of 90,000 diodes were made for the 3-bit phase shifters, which operate from 1175-1375 MHz with rms phase error less than 13° rms and average loss below 1 dB. Except for insertion phase trimming, no production tuning of the circuits was performed in the achievement of this performance. Along with the diode and circuit details, statistical data and commentary regarding the interesting aspects of this unusually large project will be presented."
"For determining the transmission properties of waveguide links, an experimental repeater for one channel with variable bandwidth was designed for error rate measurements at clock rates of 160, 320 and 640 Mbits/s. The length of the experimental waveguide link used at present is 5.65 km. The transmission frequency is 38 GHz, the modulation procedure being two-phase differential coherent phase shift keying (DCPSK). The error rate measurements are based on the theoretical error probability and distinguish between errors caused by the regenerator, the repeater itself and the waveguide. Results of error rate measurements are given as a function of the carrier-to-noise ratio, the repeater input level and the bit rate. It was found that the waveguide allows pulses to be transmitted at clock rates up to the order of 640 Mbits/s and that the pulses are increasingly affected by delay distortions at rising bit rates. However, definite statements require a longer experimental link, which is under construction."
  "In this paper the signal fluctuations arising at the receiving antenna on a satellite-to-earth radio-link during intense precipitations are studied. The four Stokes parameters, which fully describe the power and the polarization status of the wave, are evaluated in the 11 to 30 GHz range and for various rain intensities and path lenghts. Multiple scattering effects are taken into account. The results are also presented in form of incoherent to coherent power ratio at the receiving front end, assuming spherical drops, Rayleigh scatter and circular polarization. The total power fluxes, both for the inward and backward waves, are also computed."
"This paper describes a new state-of-the-art facility for millimeter-wave radioastronomy and instrumentation research presently nearing completion at the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory (FCRAO), in Amherst, Massachusetts, U.S.A. The system, employing a precision 13.7 meter reflector and state-of-the-art cooled receiver technology at 94 GHz, will demonstrate an order of magnitude increase in channel capacity over all presently used satellite communications systems. This bandwidth enhancement will be accomplished with lower total system noise figures than any other system presently operational at millimeter wavelengths. It is also argued that developing the 94 GHz band will result in reduced cost-per-unit-bandwidth for future satellite communications facilities."
 "Satellite communications are largely based on the efficient exploitation of microwave techniques. During the past decade, developments in this field have already led to a wide range of equipment becoming available for commercial use. In this survey of the current activities, some of the more important development trends are discussed, taking examples from European programs. Considering certain limitations that exist for the growth of satellite communications systems on one hand and an increasing demand for several application satellite systems on the other, problem areas can be indicated where future development efforts may be worthwhile to advance the state of the microwave art."
"Previous methods for studying the scattering properties of perfectly conducting periodic structures were derived with basis on the boundary conditions the fields must satisfy at the structure surface; in this work it is shown that those scattering properties plus the induced current along the structure surface can be studied through a different mathematical formulation exclusively derived with basis on the scattered far-fields characteristics. Complementary periodic structures, periodic structures with dielectric layers and corrugated waveguides were also studied as applications of the method. Numerical results obtained with the new method are shown to be in good agreement with the results obtained by other methods and also with experimental data."
"A general numerical technique has been previously suggested by the authors for analyzing the diffraction of plane electromagnetic wave by gratings of arbitrary groove shape [1]. In this paper, numerical solutions for rectangular and echelette gratings are presented for the case of E-polarized wave. These results are also favorably compared with a number of similar results reported in the literature and the accuracy of the technique is demonstrated."
"The scattering properties of solar-cell panels to be used on satellites are experimentally exploited. Measurements are made on individual solar cells inserted into waveguides (KU band) and then on solar-cell panels in anaechoic room. The possibility of describing the surface properties of the solar-cell panel as an imperfect conductor is demonstrated."
"Ridge waveguides are used in microwave transmission systems where broadband performance, associated with low attenuation and high power capabilities, are required. In addition, this technique is also used for various special components such as cavities, mixers, etc. Design proposals exist for single and double ridge waveguides with bandwidths of 2.4 : 1 and 3.6 : 1. Because of their simpler design, single ridge waveguides are mostly used for components such as directional couplers, filters, etc., while double ridge waveguides are usually restored to for longer transmission lines. The quality of ridge waveguide components available on the market is considerably lower than that of components in standard rectangular waveguide technique. The reflection coefficients even for simple elements such as bends, twists, straight sections, have values of r = 0.03 to 0.2 (VSWR 1.06 to 1.5). This is mainly due to the lack of suitable measuring devices during the development of such components. This has been the main reason for the design of new directional couplers with directivities D ≥ 40 dB for bandwidths of 2.4 : 1 and D ≥ 35 dB for bandwidths of 3.6 : 1. Conventional designs for coupling networks rmostly use λ/4 arrangements with corresponding matching networks at both ends. The disadvantages of such λ/4 arrangements are well known: The number of coupling holes over a given length is limited, and for coupling coefficients of 10 - 20 dB large hole diameters are required, which causes heavy field distortions and also second order effects."
"Two methods for calculating the propagation characteristics of rectangular waveguides with various internal and external media are presented. The first one is only asymptotically correct and utilizes the reflection coefficients from the walls, taking into to account depolarization. Results are presented for dielectric waveguides and rectangular tunnels in lossy dielectric. The second method is exact, but assumes an impedance condition (isotropic or anisotropic) at the waveguide walls. Results are given for a fully corrugated waveguide, indicating that the so called impedance compatibility condition is not significant."
"The radiation characteristics of a homogeneous dielectric sphere illuminated by a corrugated cylindrical waveguide with quarter wave teeth, carrying the hybrid mode (HE11) are studied. The field distribution at the aperture of the corrugated pipe is used as the sphere-illuminating source and the dielectric sphere is placed in front of, but displaced from this aperture. It is shown that this feed system has a near-circular far-field characteristics with increased on-axis gain. The feed also has reduced input VSWR due to the aperture-sphere separation; Theoretical expressions are derived for the radiated far-field components by treating the off-set sphere as a microwave lens. Experimental results obtained from a test-feed confirm the theoretical calculations made."
"Schwarz's iterative procedure of overlapping regions is employed to solve for the reflection coefficient at the open end of a flanged parallel-plate waveguide antenna, with the flange being of arbitrary flare angle. It is shown that by dividing the junction into circular and semi-infinite rectangular and sectoral sub-regions, and using Green's functions of each, the problem is reduced to the solution of a system of integral equations of the Fredholm type. The solution for the reflection coefficient of an H-plane sectoral horn is also obtained as a special case when the flare angle is less than 180° and therefore the rectangular and sectoral sub-regions directly overlap. It is shown that, in addition to being relatively simple and efficient, the solution also leads to geometrical insight into the problem whereby the magnitude of the reflection coefficient is related to the area of the overlapping region."
"A new class of components for acoustic surface waves has been developed which is based on a simple structure that is equivalent to a small section of below-cutoff transmission line. The components include power splitters, directional couplers, nonreflecting delay-line taps, attenuators, resonant cavities and certain types of filters. They have the additional advantage of working on any substrate, piezoelectric Or not. The theory for each of these components has been developed with the aid of accurate equivalent networks, taking into account the modifications introduced by the finite width of the surface wave beam. Limited measured results taken so far agree well with the theory."
 "The resistance of a polycrystalline photoconductive CdSe film upon a piezoelectric acoustic surface wave delay line is investigated. During the acoustic pulse propagates in the line, a resistance decrease by a factor up to ten is revealed. The relationship between the resistance change and the acoustic input voltage is strongly nonlinear and this property can be used for nonlinear signal processing. The effect is explained by the intercrystalline barrier modulation by the high electric fields associated with the acoustic surface wave on a piezoelectric substrate. Since the resistance change depends on light intensity, the method can be used, in a limited scale, for acoustical scanning of optical images."
"Various acoustic surface-wave components operating at frequencies higher than 1 GHz have been realized using an electron beam pattern generator. Thus delay lines, filters and oscillators have been realized on lithium niobate and quartz substrates. Simple and tapped delay lines using transducers with constant or variable finger-spacing have been tested and the bandwidth and maximum delay were found to be respectively about 600 MHz and 10 μsec. A line coded according to a 13 chip Barker code was realized as well as dispersive delay lines using split fingers. A filter with a narrow bandwidth (8 × 10-4 in relative value) was looped with an amplifier in order to obtain an oscillator operating at 1.4 GHz."
"The effect of anisotropy on disc delay line beam propagation is examined by means of a paraxial ray analysis. Anisotropic transfer matrices describe the disc's optical characteristics. The theory is applied to explain different propagation loss experimentally observed on three recirculating patterns on a Y-cut quartz disc delay line."
"A unity gain 22 μS delay module operating at 3GHz and offering an instantaneous bandwidth of 500MHz will be described together with preliminary results obtained with a 25MHz chirp radar. The 226 × 80 × 32mm package contains amplifiers, PIN switches, circulators and a Spinel bulk wave acoustic delay line integrated in gold bonded microstrip. Power supplies and PIN drivers are also included."
"Presented are results obtained from acoustic-wave components and devices employing \"soldered piezoelectric transducer\" technology and operating in the VHF and UHF bands. Based upon the intermetallic diffusion of two layers of indium, deposited beforehand on both the propagation substrate and the piezoelectric transducer, that technology makes it possible to produce transducers having high conversion efficiency. Three types of acoustic components that employ the \"SPT\" technology are described : dispersive Love-wave delay lines, S-band bulk-wave delay lines and X-band bulk-wave delay lines. In addition, details and results are given regarding oscillators and opto-acoustic deflectors and modulators built using those components."
 "Carbon and boron composites replace alloys in structures. Their favorable weight to strength ratio should not be impaired by additional metallic ground planes for antennas. Foremost comes lightning protection as these materials cannot handle energy surges. In cooperation with the Lightning and Transient Research Institute, Minneapolis, metal strip protection was developed. These double as ground plane improvement and new microstrip antenna elements are developed along with it. Microstrip radiators were developed to be distributed over complex curved surfaces to form resonant arrays."
"The number and location of cavity-blocked T-slot antenna for a specified radiation coverage on F-102 aircraft were optimized using an acoustic airframe model, and a special 0.2 MHz (thickness mode) spherical transducer to model the antenna. The model results were verified using the full-scale electromagnetic field data obtained at 1775 MHz for circular polarization. This technique is inexpensive, easy and quick to implement, and as exact as the match between the radiation patterns of the transducer and the antenna it represents. Computer simulation usually yields approximate results since surface wave, shadow, and multiple scattering effects cannot be incorporated. Similarly high frequency R.F. modeling, when feasible, is sensitive to model surface roughness, and is not suited for studying antenna location effects."
"The aperture efficiency of the 100-meter radiotelescope has been measured in the prime focus configuration at 5 GHz. Calibration was performed by inserting the feed-horn alternately in two specially designed black-body enclosures, the effective temperatures of which were provided by liquid nitrogen and liquid argon - a difference of 9.94 K. Radio sources of known flux density and brightness temperature were compared with the 9.94 K calibration, resulting in a 1.5 per cent uncertainty in the aperture efficiency. The sources of error are tabulated, and compared with those obtained by replacing the feed horn by waveguide loads."
"The analysis and experimental evaluation of a reflecting beam-waveguide feed for an earth station antenna using two plane and two off-set paraboloidal reflectors is presented. Taking the mode matching theory in an optical resonator, the electromagnetic behavior of this feed is fully discussed. The measured RF performance of the earth station antenna using this feed is evaluated."
"This communication describes a new method to predict the HE11 and TM01 radiated fields from a narrow flare angle corrugated conical horn. A modal expansion of the aperture field in terms of orthogonal Laguerre-Gaussian functions is used. The radiated field is obtained from Kirchhoff-Fresnel's approximation. Comparison with experimental results demonstrates the method efficiency. In conclusion advantages of the method are outlined."
"A new theory for the quantitative description of the noise and modulation properties of IMPATT-diode amplifiers has been developed, based on the method used in the large-signal theory of noise in IMPATT-diode oscillators by the present authors. The usefulness of the theory will be illustrated by results of calculations on AM and FM noise and their mutual correlation, AM-FM conversion, and group delay distortion. Some of these examples have been compared with results of experiments and show good agreement."
"This paper describes the use of a \"single-stage\" phase-lock-loop oscillator to provide high gain power amplification of FM communication signals as used in radio relay of multiplex telephone and television. The paper is largely theoretical, dealing with the relationship of the loop parameters to the expected performance. Measured data are also provided for two experimental amplifiers of this type. Both theory and experiment indicate that the technique offers distinct advantages for the intended application compared with multi-stage reflection amplifiers."
"Noise figures as low as 8 dB have been measured for Indium Phosphide reflection amplifiers operating over J-band (12-18 GHz). A single-stage, low noise, reflection amplifier circuit has been designed to provide a gain of 8 dB at 15 GHz., with a 1 GHz bandwidth. The effect of the package impedance parameters on available gain and bandwidth have been determined, and the properties of the completed amplifier are discussed."
"An account of a computer model is presented which is designed to simulate the large signal behaviour of GaAs transferred electron amplifier diodes. Devices have been fabricated with a variety of doping profiles following the indications of the results of the simulation. Experimental results are reported concerning the small signal impedance, noise figure, large signal impedance, maximum added power and efficiency of a number of devices of different doping profiles. Indication is given of the large signal stability, the bandwidth of the negative resistance and the third order intermodulation product measured in these devices. The results, both of the computer simulation and measurements, suggest that more efficient amplifier diodes can be produced by using a shallow notch structure and that this configuration is not optimum for lowest noise factor."
"The nonlinear effects in Impatt diode amplifiers have been investigated both theoretically and experimentally. Output power, group delay and AM-to-PM conversion characteristics show an increased unsymmetry with enhanced input level. The FM distortion is higher at band center than at the resonant frequency. Below the band center, a maximum is reached at for the AM-to-PM conversion. The output power of an amplifier may be much higher than that of an oscillator with the same diode."
"A new microwave diode package containing additional inductance and capacitance besides case capacitance and lead inductance has been considered. Admittance and small signal characteristics of a silicon IMPATT diode cased in a new package are discussed. Using one of this sort of diodes, small signal power gain in amplifiers are measured and shown electrical characteristics improvement by the adjustement of additional inductance. Under the same amplifier circuit condition, new packaged diode gave 6.5 dB bigger small signal power gain than conventional one. It is advantage to be able to have diode admittance lower by use of new package than conventional one."
"This paper describes the basic aspects for the design of wideband microwave transistor power amplifiers making use of advanced transistor technology. A novel measuring procedure for the accurate determination of the large signal impedances of microwave transistors is presented. For the matching networks special lumped elements are used which have nearly ideal, predictable frequency characteristics, low loss and are easy to manufacture. A new automatic control of the transistor operating point ensures minimum AM-PM conversion and maximum gain. In addition, a temperature controlled overload protection is achieved. These procedures are applied to the design of a six-stage 7W-4GHz transistor amplifier. Although packaged transistors without internal matching are used, the total amplifier gain of 30 dB is flat to 0.5 dB within a bandwidth of 7.5 %.. The experimental data for group delay distortion, thermal and intermodulation noise show that the amplifier is suitable for the use in 1800-channel FDM-FM radio relay systems."

   "This paper illustrates the ways in which the environment problems besetting us today can be viewed using such closed-loop principles as transmission, coupling, shielding, and others very familiar to the systems engineer.It shows need within the industry for a fuller development of the systems philosophy in the handling of environmental problems and need for further automation in both environmental monitoring and environmental control. Analogies between control theory and Pollution control concepts are given, and several applications of the system concepts are provided in areas of shielding, filtering and collection. Needs for proper monitoring, standards, and early warning of serious conditions are also discussed."
"The operation of integral horsepower motors in typical industrial applications presents unique problems requiring protective functions which go beyond those available with conventional systems. Because machine downtime results in one of the industry's most perplexing economic problems, it has become imperative that fault conditions be identified on a continuing basis. An expandable electronic system is described which not only provides protection for the motor and driven equipment but also allows the maximum safe utilization of the motor's overload capability. The compatibility of this system with the National Electrical Code requirements is also discussed."
"Low-cost fast-response thermal sensors are making it possible to add overtemperature protection to industrial motors on a retrofit basis. Easily applied by regular maintenance personnel, this protection system offers industrial plants, large and small, the opportunity for longer, trouble-free motor life, The application of sensors to existing induction motors to prevent thermal damage resulting from abnormal running overload or locked rotor conditions is also described here. Basic considerations for proper application are discussed, including motor winding configurations, insulation classes, and other design characteristics. Motor rewind shops provide a basic area of application where the sensors can be integrally installed in the stator winding at the time of repair. Examples and experiences are discussed where applications have been made."
"The inception of the T-frame line in the mid 1960's as the new standard integral horsepower induction motor has frequently raised the question among users as to the relative application capability of these motors to previous U-frame motors with which users have good application familiarity. This question has been asked and answered in numerous technical presentations and conferences. The aspects of the topic that have aroused most interest are: 1) insulation systems, temperature rating standards, and relative insulation life expectancy, 2) effect of overloads, 3) effect of over- and undervoltage, 4) effect of unbalanced voltage, and 5) bearing and shaft sizes."
"Three-phase electric power systems generally provide voltage supply at the generating station that is well balanced in both magnitude and displacement. For varying reasons, however, some degree of voltage unbalance occurs at the point of utilization, and, depending upon the amount of unbalance, this can have an adverse effect upon the operation of polyphase induction motors. A major cause of unbalanced voltage at the point of utilization is that single-phase loads on a system are not uniformly applied to all three phases. This is particularly true for some rural electric power systems, and it can also occur in large urban power systems where heavy single-phase demands are imposed by facilities such as extensive shopping plazas. A large manufacturing plant may have well balanced incoming supply voltage, but unbalance can develop within the plant from its own single-phase power requirements if these are not uniformly spread among the three phases. Regardless of the cause, unbalanced voltage is harmful to three-phase induction motors. The paper to follow concentrates upon that aspect of unbalanced voltage."
"A solid-state induction motor speed regulating scheme using a rotor chopper-controlled external resistor is investigated. This control scheme provides continuous and contactless variation of rotor resistance and thereby eliminates the undesirable features of the conventional rotor resistance control method. A thorough analysis of the steady-state performance of the system is presented. Both dc and ac circuit models are derived to describe the performance characteristics when the chopper operates under the time-ratio control (TRC) strategy. Effects of machine parameters on performance characteristics are studied. Theoretical results from the model are verified by comparison with experimental results. The torque-speed characteristic of this speed control system is essentially linear for a particular time ratio."
"The hazards of electrical shock are well known. Now, however, new technological developments have led to the design and manufacture of reliable and economical devices to detect and interrupt hazardous ground fault currents. Ground fault circuit interrupters are presently available which provide a great measure of personnel protection. This paper describes the operational characteristics of these devices and summarizes the stringent standards of performance that they must meet."
"Means commonly used to reduce shock hazard in the home include guarding, insulation, and grounding. The ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) has been employed as a back-up device should these means fail. An analysis of shock hazard accidents described in newspaper reports was made in order to gauge the effectiveness of five shock hazard protection systems. The results of this analysis are used to propose the extent of use of the GFCI in the home."
"Instrumentation, control, and electrical installations in hazardous areas are usually governed by the rules of Article 500 of the National Electrical Code (NEC). Further guidance is found in the Recommended Practices of both the American Petroleum Institute and the Instrument Society of America, as well as publications of other organizations such as the National Fire Protection Association. It is the intent of this paper to show some of the methods, other than explosion proofing, available to meet the requirements of the NEC. These include intrinsic safety, purging and pressurization, physical isolation, etc. An attempt will be made to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method. The methods discussed are those that have secured reasonable acceptance by users in the U.S. Some items of the bibliography show others used in certain other areas that may be of some interest. Also included is a discussion of what to do when substances not presently listed in the NEC are encountered. A bibliography is supplied to allow the reader to find detailed data for further study."
"The various acoustical principles that were considered in preparing an Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) noise measurement standard are discussed. Practical aspects, aimed at making the rating numbers agree fairly well with numbers that may be obtained by the consumer in his home, are also discussed."
"The blanket heater gives the engineer a new dimension in appliance design. Low watt density heat permits more efficient design with plastics as well as metals and glasses. An electrical model of the thermal system helps identify parameters within the system. After the specification of thermal constraints, the selection of the blanket heater from an electrical standpoint is facilitated by the ohms per ``square'' concept. Safety and approval criteria specify a reasonable testing procedure. The conclusion suggests references where the engineer can obtain the necessary technical data to complete most designs."
"The availability of computers and the advancement of control techniques have provided the necessary prerequisites for efficient investigation of appliance control systems by computer simulation. This paper discusses the general approach to simulation of appliance control systems, including discussions of determination of performance specifications, mathematic modeling of the appliance, simulation of the various control strategies, computer implementation, and evaluation of the results. Advantages and limitations of computer simulation are discussed. A specific application of a range temperature control system is utilized throughout the paper to demonstrate the application of the techniques and to show the value of computer simulation."
"Electric power systems for guided vehicles with speeds above 200 mi/h were investigated. Particular attention was paid to a high-speed steel wheel-driven train which has a cruise capability of 200 mi/h. Alternate propulsion, power conditioning, and power distribution systems were evaluated, and economically acceptable solutions were highlighted. The conclusion is that 25-kV single-phase ac distribution together with a vehicle propelled with dc motors, driven by a controlled rectifier, shows most promise for the near future. AC drives could be attractive candidates in five to ten years, with 25-kV 60-Hz power distributed along the wayside. However, with ac drives, there is strong incentive to distribute power using 15-kV dc if the switching could be developed."
"The Metroliner cars used in regular rail passenger service on the Northeast Corridor are the subject of a program sponsored by the Federal Railroad Administration, United States Department of Transportation, to improve the ride quality performance of the cars. The technique of mathematical modeling of the car was utilized in this program to predict and postulate methods of obtaining improved performance. The model was generated and verified, and then various parameters were altered to obtain optimum vehicle response. The altered parameters were then used to specify various car component modifications and to generate a specification for a completely new truck."
"A novel type of flowmeter is described that is based upon the deflection of air ions in an airstream by a transverse electric field. The ionization is produced by alpha radiation from a source mounted on one of the electrodes. The resulting ions follow a path determined by the air velocity, combined with a superimposed electric field having two components: a control or deflection field and a collection field. Variation of the shape and magnitude of the control field produces an ion current that varies as a function of the air flow. The use of the control field allows the device to be used over a broad range of flows with very little loss of sensitivity. Depending upon the design it can function as an anemometer, volume flowmeter, or a mass flowmeter. The device produces no obstruction to the flow and is ideally suited to in-line monitoring applications that require very low pressure losses."
"The recent concern with the problem of SO2 removal from flue gases has indicated that a need exists for some type of inexpensive yet reasonably accurate instrument to be used as a stack monitor for coal-fired power stations. This paper describes work that was carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of such an instrument based upon the fact that SO2 gas has a very strong affinity for free electrons. This property enables the SO2 concentration to be related to the current flowing in a specially designed ionization chamber that may use either a corona or a radioactive emitter as the ionization source. When used in a differential mode, it is possible to separate interfering effects caused by the broad range of variables encountered in flue gas, such as temperature, gas composition, fly ash, etc. Results are presented showing that excellent sensitivity is obtained in the crucial concentration range of < 1500 parts per million (ppm) SO2 and that the resulting instrument should be ideally suited to direct monitoring of flue gases."

 "The application of adjustable frequency static inverters to induction motor speed control has resulted in a diversity of inverter designs. In this paper, the state-variable formulation is applied to the analysis of two widely used drive systems incorporating square-wave inverters with 180° and 120° firing logic. Measured characteristics of an actual drive system are included, and the results are compared to an analytical solution. Steady-state speed-torque curves for each inverter supplying three markedly different types in induction motors are given. Performance of the two inverter drives are compared by a thorough investigation of typical operating points."
"Proper preparation of specifications is essential to obtain competitive bids for purchase and installation of large industrial rectifiers and associated facilities. Specification requirements for a power rectifier installation are presented. The article discusses the development of design specifications for purchase of the rectifier equipment, considerations in selection of a supplier, design of the dc bus system for connecting the rectifier to the load, and preparation of installation specifications. Also included is an example of how the computer may be used to determine optimum bus bar material. A sample problem is included."
"A single-phase bridge inverter system is analyzed. It is assumed that the inverter output voltage waveform is pulse-width modulated to control the system voltage. The system involves a closed-loop control containing a pulse modulator supplying a general filter. A feedback signal which is a function of the filter output is compared with a reference constant to deliver the error signal which determines the pulsewidth. A modified Lyapunov theorem on bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stability is used in the stability analysis of the discrete state equations for the system. Sufficient conditions for BIBO stability are derived. The results are verified by a digital computer simulation of the system. Systems with linear parts that have distinct or repeated eignvalues that are either real or complex may be analyzed using this method."
"Evaluation of conventional losses in rectifier transformers, as performed according to the various national standards, and particularly as performed according to International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) recommendations, is scarcely satisfactory because it does not take into proper consideration the pulsating nature of the current and neglects some elements that give a fair contribution to total losses. Some test elaboration methods are proposed, as well as a test circuit to evaluate in a more accurate way the losses in transformers, interphase transformers, and saturable reactors. Some examples are given, and the available experimental result is in a good agreement with the calculations."
"The static Ward-Leonard drive suffers from two major disadvantages: 1) poor power factor when the phase-controlled converter supplying the motor is operated at a delayed triggering angle, and 2) the problems associated with discontinuous armature current when the machine is lightly loaded. If asymmetrical triggering technique is judiciously applied to a converter-controlled dc drive, it improves not only the power factor but also the overall performance of the drive. It reduces the ripple content of the armature current and the value of the extra inductance necessary to achieve current continuity for low-current operation."
"Tires, that amazing product so essential to the complicated transportation network in the United States, and rubber, the old-time plastic ingredient, its processes surrounded with an aura of black magic, are a fascinating field which is little known outside its own technological circles. Machine builders catering to the tire manufacturers are confronted with some unusual requirements dictated by economic and process factors peculiar to this particular industry. They are attempting to cope with these factors and with the added process complexities brought about by the changing technology-including the radial tire. A large share of the responsibility for this effort falls on the control designer. He is the one who has the task of making the brain of the automated tire machines smart enough to do the job. Yet he must do this without losing sight of simplicity, economy, and reliability to match the requirements. This paper will cover, some techniques, more or less new, which have been tried and proven to be quite effective where applied to the task of controlling automatic tire assembly machinery in the 1970's."
"All engineers concerned with the design of an automated process require a clear understanding of the desired operation. The Operational Control Statement clearly expresses the control desired in a simplified, tabular form that electrical engineers and nonelectrical engineers can readily write and read. It expresses requirements for starting, sustaining, interlocking, time delay, sequenced events, shutdown, memory, and alternating events, in a concise manner. The method is quicker to write, easier to read, and quicker to review than presently used methods."
 "The design, manufacture, characteristics, and applications of corrugated, impervious, metallic-sheathed power and control cables are discussed. These type ALS and type MC cables, authorized under National Electrical Code Articles 331 and 334, ensure compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) regulations, particularly in hazardous locations."
"MOST electrical engineers are aware of the vulnerability of above grade cables to fire and other hazards that could exist, and they are concerned about methods of protecting these cables from such dangers. The intent of underground methods is to provide protection for long cable runs from possible hazards created by nearby units. Other methods can be used within segments of an operating unit where the cables come above grade."
"Railroad operations have for many years been plagued with poor safety performance at grade crossings. Many lives are lost each year in accidents at crossings, to say nothing of costly injuries and property damage sustained. The situation has gotten worse with the advent of soundproofed cars, being driven at high speed in conditions of poor visibility. Clearly then, some improved method of warning motorists as they approach a grade crossing is needed. Analysis of a critical encounter between a road vehicle and a locomotive reveal that the presently used equipment is inadequate to meet the needs of present day high-speed vehicles. A system of vehicular movement warning devices is described in this paper that mighty improve to some extent the safety of grade crossing operations. Two methods are detailed. One involves static directional sonic devices positioned at the crossing; warning activation is made on a real-time closing velocity determination. The other system employs a special variety of cattle guard in the roadway, to issue a tactile warning. Both systems are designed to give adequate warning to a motorist in a critical encounter situation as he approaches the crossing with a convergent locomotive on the track(s). A bonus feature in the use of selectively activated static directional sound warning sources would be the curtailment of urban noise levels, where trains presently use the mobile audible source to issue warnings."
"Etched metal foil elements are gaining recognition as a practical new way of heating appliances. They are super thin, lightweight, and offer great flexibility and versatility in applying the heat where it is needed. For the appliance manufacturer, the foil heater offers several major advantages over the traditional strip or tubular types."
"Great progress has been made in the efficiencies of light sources used in outdoor and industrial lighting during the past decade. Today's high intensity discharge (HID) lamps provide up to 140 lm/W compared to approximately 17 lm/W for the filament lamp. Each of the different HID light sources-mercury, metal halide, and high-pressure sodium-require different ballasting techniques. To obtain maximum efficiency and proper operation of the HID lamps, close attention should be given to the selection of the proper ballast. Luminaire design has kept pace with the progress made in light sources and today there is a wide variety of integrally ballasted HID luminaires suitable for practically any outdoor or indoor industrial or commercial application."
"Time-dependent (sequence control) processes lend themselves to control techniques that differ from those employed in other real-time control applications. Some tasks of the computer are time critical; however, many tasks can operate in a time-deferred mode to increase the utilization of the computer. Control systems for a pipeline operation are examples of this control philosophy. The computer is used to gather and display operational information, and execute certain predefined control sequences. Where possible, industry standard techniques are used in software definition."
"The function of electrostatic precipitators installed on fluid catalytic cracker flue gas lines is to remove the particulate matter as an air pollution control measure. This paper reviews significant steps involved in designing a particular precipitator installation, coordinating the construction effort, starting up and operating the system, and obtaining necessary results to satisfy the local air quality regulating agencies. The material presented is based upon experience gained from recent electrostatic precipitator installation projects in several refineries located across the nation."
"The reduction in capital cost and the changing relationship of energy costs combine to make electrically driven compressors an attractive alternative to the most advanced gas powered compressor stations for natural gas pipelines. On a typical 1250-mi pipeline with 20 000-hp compressor stations, electric drives will cut capital costs to one-half and produce annual savings of $12 million. This paper presents relative cost estimates for complete compressor stations, system power requirements, and costs of ownership and operation."

 "Protecting thyristors by means of fuses in electro-chemical rectifiers where more than 100 devices are used in a single unit may cause considerable service interruption when fuses open during temporary faults. This paper considers the thyristor and fuse ratings in conjunction with gate suppression techniques to achieve a protective system which allows a 17.5 MW rectifier to ``ride through'' momentary faults without service interruptions."
"A guide to the generated line currents from six-pulse converters is presented. Included are the effects of commutating reactance, phase angle retard, partially inductive loads, and general comments on plant distribution layout, especially electrochemical plants. It is intended as a concise general guide to predicting the level of harmonics to be expected in a specific case, and as a guide in minimizing the occurrence of the more complex circuit effects of a total system. Harmonic currents in large thyristor converters, Megaverters ®, are found to be not significantly greater than in diode converters; however, more care must be given to plant layout of multiphase systems in order to benefit from the attempt at harmonic reduction."
"In recent years, the use of thyristors for regulation of bulk power has grown appreciably. The Megaverter ® (Megawatt Power Converter) utilizes the thyristor for control and rectification to supply 52.5 MW of dc power for electrochemical use. The system consists of three Megaverters, each rated at 17.5 MW, connected in parallel. The thyristor assemblies are sized for worst-case short circuit surge, thereby providing maximum protection for critical components and eliminating costly downtime through nuisance tripping. Aluminum extrusion is used for the thyristor cabinet, allowing modular construction, reduction in size, and maximum design flexibility. Aluminum is also used for busbar and the thyristor water-cooled heatsink assemblies. The overall design approach results in simplified maintenance, reduced downtime, and simplicity of control for large thyristor controlled power converters."
"The trend of industry toward higher speed machines and longer periods between downtimes has fostered closer surveillance of those parameters that can interrupt satisfactory service. Vibration of electric motors and systems containing motors are areas identified for consideration. Electric motor vibration is discussed from the viewpoint of its causes and cures. Also covered are the important considerations in establishing purchase specifications consistent with final installation requirements."
"A new and unique type of de motor is described whose construction includes a rotating permanent magnet field and a stationary wound structure together with a radically different mechanism for commutating the stationary winding. Design features of rotating magnet structures and the commutating mechanism are presented. Performance characteristics of an actual motor are shown. Also described are the changes in performance that can be realized by design variations in the amount of copper in the stator."
"Flow control of pumps with adjustable speed ac drives can be very economical. Pump and system head/flow characteristics are reviewed, with suggestions for estimating the pump characteristic and efficiency at reduced speed. Generalized pump and savings curves are then developed to permit quick checking of the economics of adjustable speed flow control for various system characteristics."
"In recent years, industrial plants have been utilizing more electric motors as drivers because of their high efficiency and reliability and lower maintenance costs. Electrified continuous process plants are using electric motors for both primary and standby drives. When these standby motors are not operating during normal plant runs, their windings collect moisture. Moisture attacks insulation and causes insulation failure. A breakdown of motor insulation may occur when a standby motor is suddenly energized to take the place of the primary motor. When it is not in operation, directly heating the motor winding with a low voltage system, coupled with automatic control, will guard the motor from moisture attack and extend its service life. The experience with low voltage heating of motor windings as described by M. H. Yuen in his article [1] has proved its effectiveness. However, conventional relays, timers, contactors, etc., were utilized in the circuits."
"A user's experience in applying hard-wired logic and programmable logic controls is presented. Initial assumptions will be compared with the end result. Aspects to be covered include initial costs, design time, development time, and turnover to maintenance personnel."
"Power dips, interruptions, and disturbances occur frequently throughout a plant power distribution system that adversely affect plant lighting, computers, process controls, and drive systems. Critical processes that must operate continuously require an uninterruptible power supply to protect against both long-and short-term interruptions. However, most industrial processes are not critical and need only be protected against power transients and short duration outages. Process equipment with properly supplied ride-through capability can prevent waste and downtime. It is the intent of this paper to discuss short duration power line disturbances; the type of , control and stored energy system available to protect against these disturbances; and the advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches available to ride through power line disturbances."
"The increasing use of nonmetallic cables in cable trays for industrial plant applications as recognized in the 1975 National Electrical Code, Article 340, mandates that these cables be suitable for this application and that the outer sheath be flame-retardant. The significance of various flame tests is discussed, and data obtained following procedures and modifications of IEEE Standard 383-1974, Section 2.5, are presented. It is evident that nonmetallic sheathed tray cables are available that will comply. Furthermore, when a flame-resistant jacket is applied over type ALS, MC, or AC armored assemblies, it results in an exceptionally rugged, corrosion, and flame-resistant nonpropagating construction."
"The suspension-preheater flash-furnace (SF) process for cement clinkering introduces a calcining flash furnace operating as an integral portion of a suspension preheater, rotary kiln, and clinker cooler system. Preheated raw meal from the suspension preheater is calcined in the flash furnace to 80 to 90 percent decarbonation. The capacity of the SF rotary kiln is increased thereby, since its function is limited to sintering rather than sintering and calcining. The flash furnace incorporates vortex flow to accomplish the mixing of fuel, raw meal, and gases. Effective distribution within the flash furnace limits temperature gradients and eliminates localized elevated temperatures that might otherwise lead to coating and material build-up. Hot combustion gases are recovered from the clinker cooler for use in the flash furnace. An orifice in the kiln gas exit duct serves to balance the parallel gas flows through the kiln and secondary air duct. Operating pressures and temperatures are described. The smaller size of the rotary kiln used in the SF process leads to extended refractory life as demonstrated by operating experience. The SF process is adaptable to the control of internal alkali, sulfur, and chlorine cycles through a gas bypass and through a unique material withdrawal arrangement from the flash furnace. Existing plants may be modified to incorporate the SF process. Nearly 20 commercial scale plants are operating or are being constructed."
"The use of a variable resistance heating element to monitor the temperature of work and control heat input to the element is described. A solid-state controller that measures the element temperature by continuous monitoring of the element resistance i used to control the voltage input to the element. This eliminates separate temperature measuring device such as thermostat, thermo couple, or thermistor and associated wiring. In addition, the average temperature of the work is measured rather than the temperature of a single location."
"A standardized instrumentation system for computer automated measurement and control (CAMAC) is gaining wide international acceptance for industrial and laboratory applications. The system features a fully specified dataway together with modular functional units that are completely compatible with each other and that are available from diverse sources. The system is nonproprietary and can be freely used without license or restriction of any, kind."
"There is a need for industrial control system designs to be less dependent upon the implementation and source of the various elements within the system, including the control computer. However, a number of system design considerations confront the user of computer-independent industrial control hardware. Various software implications and organizational considerations are discussed, along with hardware organization parameters. Solutions to various software and system problems are proposed by applying the computer automated measurement and control (CAMAC) digital interface standard."
"Electrical characterization is based on a display of voltage and charge which appears as a simple parallelogram. The area is a measure of energy input per cycle and is independent of voltage waveform but very dependent on the maximum voltage. A useful model for such corona discharges employs a Zener diode to simulate the corona drop. The buffer dielectric plays a major roll in controlling the corona power, and the air gap importance depends on the electrode system employed. Proper interpretation of the voltage-charge traces provides insight as to the corona performance and serves as a diagnostic procedure for obtaining optimum performance."

 "The cage winding of an induction or a synchronous motor can be protected against excessive heating when the temperature of the cage is made available in the motor control room. An explanation of a practical system that provides direct cage temperature readout plus adjustable setting alarm contacts is presented."
"Instantaneous trip type circuit breakers can protect controllers against damage due to overcurrents above six and up to 13 times full load motor currents (FLMC). They may be used for full protection if the starter and wire are self-protected up to 13 times FLMC. Molded case circuit breakers take at least 1/2 to 1 cycle to interrupt. An interrupting time of 1 cycle is too long at high let-through currents to protect contactors from being damaged and, in many cases, to protect heaters from being burned out. A line of high fault circuit protectors is described that protect all branch circuit components in case the available short circuit current is so high that the let-through current would, without protectors, be higher than a current that the branch circuit elements could with-stand for at least 1 cycle. A system is described that insures tripping of the circuit breaker whenever a high fault circuit protector opens. Tests, physical arrangements, coordinated system selections, and applications are described."
"The TEWAC (totally enclosed water-air cooled) induction motor is not a new development. Such machines have long been common in Europe. Their usage in the United States has been less frequent, but growing emphasis on noise reduction is creating new interest in the inherently quiet TEWAC machine. Review of current specifications and orders shows that many motor users, inexperienced in TEWAC applications, are uncertain how to deal with possible cooler leakage, water flow control and monitoring, effects of high water temperature, motor rating versus ambient temperature, water chemistry, and cooler construction and mounting. Each of these matters is discussed in detail."
"Vibration analysis and monitoring for machinery protection continues to be a rapidly growing field. Whether to use acceleration, velocity, or displacement often places the user in a quandary. So does the choice of vibration sensors. These subjects are discussed in a clear, easy to read manner, with specific examples to illustrate the selections. The intent of the paper is to remove ``guesswork'' in the selection of sensors and vibration modes. A discussion of the economic justification for vibration is also included."
"The importance of interface standards to both users and suppliers of large process control systems is discussed together with certain admonitions as to their proper use. Issues of special import in the large system are identified with respect to the some-what dissimilar user-versus-supplier interests, and an effort is made to relate these to an existing standard. In particular, aspects to be considered include economy, fault tolerance, flexibility, ruggedness, and longevity."
"The design, construction, and operation of experimental models of a dc-type hybrid step motor are discussed. This form of hybrid motor consists of a variable-reluctance step motor, the rotor of which is appropriately wound as a multipole dc motor. A computer-aided design procedure is discussed that is used to obtain the optimum parameters of the dc portion of the hybrid motor. The results obtained with two experimental models of this type of hybrid motor are presented. Both prototypes show a marked improvement in the running torque characteristics due to the dc windings. Torque-speed curves indicate load torques of 400 oz-in available at speeds up to several thousand revolutions per minute with one of the proto-types. This type of hybrid motor may be controlled in one of three different ways: a pure step motor, a pure dc motor, or a dc-aided step motor. The relative advantages, disadvantages, and application of each control mode are discussed. Several control strategies-open and closed loop-are presented for speed control as well as point-to-point type control of position. The practical feedback feasibility of this concept for high-power applications in the integral horsepower range is discussed."
"Basic information on modeling and digital computer simulation of variable-reluctance (VR) step motors is provided. The nonlinear equations of the system are derived, and a method for implementing them on a digital computer is presented. As an example, a typical printer with a step motor is designed with this approach. The problem is defined by giving the desired system performance criteria and the step motor parameters and characteristics. The specification of the control schemes determined the design. Computer simulation runs are made to determine the optimal control parameters of the system. The case study demonstrates the advantages of the computer-aided design, before the physical construction of the experimental system."
"General mathematical relations are developed for the power factor and harmonic contents of the currents and metering voltages of thyristor controlled inductive loads fed from a source having significant impedance. This impedance has previously been neglected; it could be that of the supply feeder or transformer. The general relations developed cover the special cases described in the literature. Numerical solutions and the results obtained by an analogue computer study agree with those of actual tests. The voltage regulation caused when feeding a thyristor controlled load is slightly less than when feeding an uncontrolled load of the same power and equal power factor. The voltage regulation decreases with decrease of power factor for the same thyristor controlled load."
"Historically, the electrical engineer's role in the petroleum and chemical industries has been primarily the efficient use of electrical energy. Recent and probable future changes in fuel costs, environmental requirements, and availability of adequate energy create problems. However, opportunities are opened up for creative thinking on the part of electrical engineers as related to both use and production of electrical energy. Ways in which electrical engineers can more effectively contribute to energy conservation are discussed. Examples are used to illustrate recent practice. In addition, proposals are developed to suggest areas where the electrical engineer's unique technical knowledge can contribute to increased efficiency in the generation and utilization of our most versatile form of energy."
"The mutual protection problems encountered by the customer and utility on oil field electric distribution systems are identified, and one electric utility company's approach in assisting customers with these problems is described. The distribution protection concepts employed by the Texas Electric Service Company are presented, and performance based on several years of experience is discussed. A high impulse lightning-resistant construction concept is illustrated and described, and the operating results are discussed."
"The paper goes systematically through the problem of load selection, negotiating load supply details with the electric utility, electrical supply contract completion, and the design specification, construction, and maintenance of electrical substation facilities as applied to pipeline pump and compressor station. The ``simple'' type of substation is discussed, although component specifications and selection normally are the same regardless of substation complexity. An up-to-date list of applicable United States and Canadian Standards as well as a detailed list of required tests to be carried out on individual components are included in the Appendix."
"The relationship between recognized insulated power cable specifications and their application to the pulp and paper industry is discussed. Differences in wall thicknesses and the relationship between grounded, ungrounded, and percent of insulation level are pointed out. An explanation of ampacity ratings, the various tables available, and how shields should be related to short circuit current is provided. The effect of aging on cable life and a description of objectives of field tests with recommended test values are included."
"A numerical method is developed for recovering the temperature distribution in glass from spectral radiation emission data. The desired temperature distribution is obtained using an optimization scheme that determines the best temperature profile from the data in a form of discrete points or Legendre polynomials. In order to evaluate the accuracy and validity of the spectral remote sensing method, the recovered temperatures are compared with independent measurements in two different experiments, one of which uses a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Experimental results are reported for Corning Code 7940 fused silica using a Perkin-Eimer spectrometer to measure the spectral radiant energy emerging from the glass. The recovered and interferometrically measured temperatures are found to be in good agreement, i.e., within about 1 ½ percent at temperatures up to about 800 K."
"The glass container industry is faced for the first time with the problem of selecting and installing air pollution control equipment on their furnaces. Equipment selection and design and application factors associated with installing an electrostatic precipitator are discussed. Preliminary engineering studies, engineering check list items, bid evaluation, costs, testing, and performance guarantees are also covered."
"The use of a portable differential current measurement system in the measurement of small leakage currents in high direct current electrochemical cell lines is discussed.

 "Analog dc tachogenerators are widely used as velocity transducers in industrial control systems. Despite the widespread use of miniature dc generators for this purpose, there are practical alternatives that should be considered for the analog measurement of velocity. The design and performance characteristics of homopolar and derived tachogenerators are discussed. These transducers are unique in their low inertia and noise generation, making them particularly suitable for velocity-control systems using high-performance dc motors as the power actuators."
"This paper describes and analyzes the performance of a three-phase voltage control scheme that uses only three thyristors. This scheme produces balanced three-phase currents and voltages, the harmonic content of which are discussed along with its suitability for use as a simple control scheme for heating lighting and motor loads."
"In certain types of adjustable frequency induction motor drives, optimal control of the motor can be best implemented by using information on the motor slip frequency. Unfortunately, this generally requires the use of an electromechanical speed transducer coupled to the shaft. The presence of this transducer spoils the general characteristics of ruggedness and mechanical simplicity typical of an ac drive. This paper discusses an improved method of obtaining the slip information without the use of rotary transducers of any kind. By sensing the electrical quantities applied to the motor (voltages, currents, and phases) and by performing simple signal processing operations on the sensed quantities, an analog signal proportional to the slip level is derived and used in motor control functions."
"A design method is described for a saturistor which enables the stall current of an induction motor to be restricted to some predetermined value without significant effect on the full-load operation. The design method requires knowledge of the dynamic B-H loop for the hard magnetic saturistor material. With controlled sinusoidal primary supply voltage and the saturistor connected in the secondary circuit, increased torque at reduced current was obtained during stall."
"The measurement of glass temperature is essential to the understanding and control of efficient glass processing operations. The physical principles of temperature measurement using infrared techniques are described. Emphasis is primarily placed on infrared radiation thermometry (pyrometry) for measuring glass surface temperature and the spectral remote sensing method for recovering temperature distribution in glass. The radiation thermometry for measuring glass surface temperature is reviewed, and difficulties caused by the presence of spectrally selective attenuation of radiation by atmospheric constituents or combustion products such as H20, C02, and others are discussed. Criteria for selecting spectral bandwidths appropriate under the circumstances of glass manufacturing are given, with special emphasis on the effects of environmental spectral absorption. A technique for reconstructing the temperature distribution in glass from remotely sensed spectral emission data is presented. The validity and accuracy of the spectral remote sensing method is established by comparing temperature profiles in glass samples under a variety of different physical conditions with independent measurements."
"Today's electric airduct heater is no longer just a hot resistance wire stretched across a metal frame in an airduct but a complete electrical system fully deserving the attention of electrical engineers. This paper presents information, such as the features, design, selection, application, control, codes governing the construction and installation, and other data, about electric airduct heaters in such a manner that a better understanding of their characteristics and use can be obtained."
"Current regulation plays an important part in the protection of solid-state drives operating from stiff voltage sources. Certain types of pulsewidth modulated (PWM) inverters, however, are not directly suited for peak or average output current regulation with induction motor loading. It is established in the paper that the typical output voltage response times of defined voltage waveform PWM inverters are 1) too high for peak output current regulation, and 2) too low for average output current regulation---i.e., for stable current regulation, the control system must limit the rate of inverter output voltage reduction. Inverter voltage control requirements and inverter deratings necessary to implement average output current regulation are presented. Experimental results from a 15-hp bread-board are included."
"An optimization method, which will be of use in selecting the modulation technique and Carrier frequency for a PWM inverter system, is presented. The difficult decision, concerning the tradeoff between efficiency and unfiltered harmonic content, can be made with the help of this method. A relation between second-order filter rating and unfiltered harmonic attentuation, for optimum component values, is also obtained. The optimization method is used for illustration to select the optimum modulation technique and its carrier frequency for the modified McMurray inverter [1] to be used in a rapid transit auxiliary power converter. The design aim is to obtain a constant sine wave output with a specific input supply voltage variation. The inverter efficiency is predicted for various carrier frequencies using two modulation schemes. The Schonung and Stemmler [2] modulation approach, with a carrier frequency of 900 Hz, is found to be optimum as it results in low filter rating and an efficient inverter."
"A circuit controlled by thyristors and having series RLC elements gives rise to a step-up phenomenon. The term step-up is defined with respect to the capacitance voltage on steady state operation, i.e., the ratio of the maximum peak value when controlled by thyristers to the peak amplitude when thyristors are short-circuited exceeds unity. The domain of possible step-up voltage is determined by the angle of displacement between current and voltage and damping factor. The step-up voltages appear across each element, i.e., not only across the capacitance, inductance, and resistance but also across the thyristors. The control characteristic has a distinctive hump phenomenon. The interrupted current results in waveform distortion, phase lag, and improved power factor. The difference of characteristics between the peak and rms values of voltages, particularly of inductance and thyristors, is large. The response time, which is evaluated by numbers of half cycles, is large when the step-up ratio becomes large. The output voltage when the circuit is used as a voltage source has a drooping characteristic."
"The composition and use of an improved current rating system for high-current high-frequency thyristors is described. Commonly accepted methods for rating thyristors at low-frequency wide-pulsewidth conditions were not adequate for this task. To fill this void, a new system was developed that incorporates a combination of simultaneously measured high-frequency parameter data with a computer program based on thyristor models using device parameters measured at low frequency. A complete description of the high-frequency simultaneous parameter data is given, including the direct measurement of peak junction temperature, turnoff time, which is used as an indirect check on the junction temperature measurement, and dissipated power. A description of the computer models, including those for instantaneous active area, charge modulation, and thermal impedance as a function of area, is also given. These models generally require the input of empirical parameters, the value of which can be measured at low repetition rate. These include the steady state and dynamic forward drop for the charge modulation model, the plasma spreading velocity for the instantaneous active area model, and the steady state dc thermal resistance for the thermal impedance model. A direct comparison between computer predictions and actual performance for a particular device is presented as a check on rating system performance. When the computer correctly predicts device performance for specific cases, it can be used to derive ratings for any arbitrary current waveform."
"A variety of factors including cost effectiveness, output rating, and reliability influence the choice of cooling method for semiconductor power conversion equipment. For this study, a number of representative cooling systems (air, water, immersion) were evaluated for a 700 V ac to adjustable voltage dc conversion equipment. A transient thermal model of an external pressure-mounted double-side cooled thyristor (such as a Press Pak, Hockey Puk, Disk Pac, etc.) was used to demonstrate the transient time frame over which changes in the cooling system affect the system rating. The systems evaluated provided a range of system performance and demonstrated the need for careful definition of application requirements."
"An orthogonal-flux passive power converter operating under conditions of sinusoidal excitation is analyzed, using a non-linear feedback approach based on the principle of harmonic balance. The stability of possible states of oscillation is discussed via a frequency domain approach. Analytical bounds on system parameters and an expression for the secondary flux oscillation amplitude are derived."
"The system developed for component testing at an appliance manufacturing facility is described. The complete installation consists of minicomputers that control several test stands and report the test results to a central quality assurance station. The various system components are 1) a disk-based central computer quality assurance station, 2) three computerized test stands for simultaneous testing of 48 ``infinite switches'' used in electric range surface heater control, 3) air-fluidized aluminum oxide temperature baths, and 4) a snap-disk thermostat test stand, equipped with its own minicomputer and communications capability with the central station."
"Common motor circuit protection has consisted of thermal overload to sense motor overcurrent and a short circuit protective device which acts after a catastrophic condition has occurred. While this combination has provided adequate protection for the most common motor and motor circuit problems, it has not provided good protection against many of the problem conditions that can occur in the motor circuit. Common motor and motor circuit problems, the circuit variances that occur and the use of common devices under these conditions are discussed. It is shown how a solid-state logic approach can sense these circuit variances and result in an economical package providing improved protection, coordinated and easily applied, which can help eliminate or minimize loss due to many of these common problems."
"Insulated power cable with aluminum conductors has been widely applied at both low and medium voltages in industrial and commercial electric systems. The economic pressure on the cost and availability of copper assures that the use of aluminum conductors will be accelerated. Aluminum cable is available in the same sizes and with the same insulations as copper cable. Devices and methods have been designed for properly splicing and terminating aluminum cable. The successful use of aluminum cable depends primarily on good installation practice that would apply to copper cable as well. There are, however, some differences between copper and aluminum, and the object of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the significance of these differences."
"At an early stage in the planning of a new production facility or expansion of an existing one, a cement producer must decide upon the unit size of the grinding equipment. The type of drives for the mills must also be selected. These selections are most often based upon economics, considering both the initial investment and the cost of operation. Regardless of the type of drive selected, it is of the utmost importance that the components are well matched to perform faultlessly as a unit. The strength factors in the transmission are dealt with here, as well as an analysis of the contributing loads. How the magnitude of the loads can be determined by analytical methods and by measurements will also be described."
"The subject of modern plant design as related to the fully automated Pertigalete plant is discussed.

   "The first step in recognizing the necessity of low voltage ground fault protection was taken by the 1971 National Electrical Code (NEC), Section 230-95. With the passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) of 1970, more emphasis has been placed on adherence to the code. Since the establishment of OSHA, questions have been raised as to the jurisdiction between the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Mining Enforcement and Safety Administration (MESA). This has resulted in both agencies considering and deciding on design standards for cement plant electrical systems. Indications are that in the future, MESA standards will also recognize the necessity of adequate ground fault protection. Since the introduction of ground fault protection in the codes, there have been arguments for and against the methods of applying ground fault protection. It is for this reason that the present code requirements are minimal. In order to provide the electrical service reliability required by modern cement plants, more extensive protection is required. The intent of this paper is to evaluate the new requirements of ground fault protection. It also examines how we, as engineers concerned with electrical power systems in cement plants, approach the problems of providing safe reliable electrical systems which meet applicable code requirements and which also function satisfactorily in relation to plant operation."
"Emergency and standby power is fast becoming a major consideration in commercial and institutional buildings and complexes. In fact, emergency power is a National Electric Code mandatory requirement for health care facilities and places of assembly. Transfer switches are a vital link in the portion of a distribution system that must provide power and illumination essential to life and property. Overcurrent protection is of equal importance. It is the purpose of this paper to objectively define and analyze important transfer switch functions and application criteria. Of these, the coordination of overcurrent protective devices to match the transfer switch ratings, under fault conditions, is perhaps the most important application aspect in providing reliable operation of a standby or emergency power system."
"One of the most important considerations in the development of the overall protection scheme in an industrial plant is the special relaying requirements of the industrial plant-utility power system intertie. The proposed revision to IEEE Red Book Chapter III includes a description of typical intertie relaying practices for industrial plants both with and without in-plant generation. The application of this relaying will be reviewed and several problem areas that must be recognized and dealt with for satisfactory system performance will be discussed."
"The importance of selecting the proper transformer winding connections because of its influence on power system operation and relaying is emphasized. The delta-wye connection is recommended."
"Electrical enclosures have historically been painted with dark colors ostensibly to enhance the radiation of internally generated heat. Outdoors, these dark colors are great absorbers of solar radiation, from which the enclosure incurs an appreciable temperature rise. The lighter colors absorb less solar radiation, incurring smaller solar temperature rise. However, it is demonstrated that these lighter colors radiate the lower temperatures of the equipment as well as the darker colors. Hence, equipment painted with the lighter colors will operate at a lower temperature and be subject to less severe derating from the effects of solar radiation."
"Wire and cable, the most ubiquitous of all electrical components, are susceptible to failure from many causes unrelated to service life. Installation damage ranks high in the list of failure causes: the interrelationship between the eight major installation methods and the ways in which they are most likely to cause damage are explained. Damage is largely due to oversharp bending, excessive lateral (sidewall) pressure, puncture, and abrasion. This damage may be avoided by readily usable variations in the installation process, which are outlined in the paper. To detect approaching failure of cable insulation due to damage, defects, or simple electrical degradation, testing with high potential dc at logical intervals has been found highly effective. In-service failures are thus substantially avoided. The reasoning behind testing methods, details on testing procedures, evaluation of results, and testing history are explained."
"Following the widespread introduction of nonmetallic water mains to the technology of water supply systems, concrete-encased grounding electrodes are now in use in low-voltage installations. The American and German approaches are discussed in terms of the influence of the concrete casing, the electrode dimensions, and the depth of placement on the resistance-to-earth. Conclusions are drawn as to how an effective equivalent to that of the metallic water mains system is obtainable. The potential-equalization aspect is also discussed."
"A survey of 101 cement plants in the United States revealed that over one fourth of the dust collected from kiln exhaust gases is discarded because of excessive concentrations of alkalies, predominantly potassium, which makes the dust unsuitable for, return to the cement making process. Leaching of alkalies from kiln dust, either in rainwater percolating through disposal piles, or in dust reclamation processes, causes the most serious water pollution problem faced by the cement industry. Treatment of the leachate by electrodialysis to recover and concentrate alkalies is recommended. A promising alternative to disposal of the dust is utilization in agriculture for neutralizing acidic soils and replenishing potassium removed by crops."
"The electrostatic precipitator has proven to be a highly successful piece of equipment for the removal of suspended particulate matter in the gas streams discharged from cement kilns. Whether the high collection efficiency of the precipitator will be maintained on a continuous basis can often be related to proper maintenance procedures. This paper is primarily offered as a nontechnical coverage of some problems that may face the maintenance department of a cement plant after the installation of the precipitator. Whether these problems actually arise are subject to many variables, including the thought and care given to reliability features in the original design. Discussion is presented to facilitate a better understanding of how precipitator design and kiln operating parameters can affect maintenance procedures."
"The first large gearless ball-mill in North America has been successfully installed at the Mississauga, Ontario, plant of the St. Lawrence Cement Company. The motor rating is 8750 hp (6500 kW) at 14.5 r/min (4.84 Hz). The electrical aspects considered of interest are discussed in the paper."
"The reinforced suspension preheater (RSP) process for the production of portland cement comprises a suspension preheater equipped with precalcining vessels designated as swirl burner and swirl calciner. The process has been demonstrated through the operation of a 235 metric ton per day plant. The swirl burner and swirl calciner provide effective heat transfer and permit control of temperature to obtain raw meal decarbonation of 85-90 percent. Data are presented describing sulfur absorption at various stages of the process. Nitrogen oxide emissions are limited due to the low temperature maintained in the swirl calciner. Excellent cement quality has been obtained."
"The performance of inverter drives, which use the pulsewidth modulated (PWM) technique to control motor applied voltage and frequency, are critically influenced by the choice of the modulation policy used in the control circuits. This paper deals with practical inverter drives for squirrel cage induction motors and presents some basic considerations on modulation requirements. The advantages and limitations of popular modulation methods are discussed, and an improved modulation scheme, which allows us to extend the practical speed range of PWM ac drives, is presented."
"The exact equations defining steady-state operation of a controlled current induction motor drive system are derived by solving the system state equations in the stationary reference frame. These equations, which assume ideal current filtering, eliminate the difficulties involved in taking derivatives of discontinuous currents by defining a pair of pseudocurrent variables. Effects of saturation are included by using the slope ratio method. Electromagnetic torque and current pulsations are computed for various load conditions, and experimental confirmation of the calculated results is made. Similarities and differences to voltage controlled characteristics are presented. It is shown that normal open-loop operation occurs on the unstable side of the torque-slip characteristic necessitating the use of feedback control for stable operation."
"As the complexity of integrated circuits increases and the cost per package decreases, the trade-off between software and hardware in process control systems needs to be reevaluated. Presently, complete functions can be implemented in a single module, freeing the CPU for more powerful application programs. The functional modules are particularly attractive when a standard interface system is used, since one can obtain a wide variety of equipment from a wide variety of suppliers. Some examples of functional modules manufactured to the computer automated measurements and control (CAMAC) standard are described."
"Electrical safety hazards in chlorine electrolytic cell rooms have been thoroughly discussed in previous papers. However, no attempt has ever been made to show the importance of maintaining maximum leakage resistance from the electrolytic cell line to ground. The majority of electrical shocks received by electrolytic cell room personnel are from the energized bus or chlorine cells to ground. As electrolytic cell lines are normally not grounded, the leakage resistance to ground has a definite effect on the severity of the majority of electrical shocks received by personnel. The leakage resistance problem is explained with the use of simple circuit diagrams, and solutions are suggested to eliminate electrical shocks to cell room personnel."
"Thyristors today are used in various electrical apparatus where high operational reliability is of prime importance. For better operational reliability, it is essential that thyristors be used most effectively. It especially is important to predict quantitatively the thyristor's internal impedance (dynamic impedance) which varies by time and by switching loss as transiential stress is applied to the thyristor when it is turned-on and -off, and to design a thyristor circuit basing on the predicted dynamic impedance. This article introduces an outline of a measuring system which can be used for quantitative determination of dynamic characteristics of thyristors and discusses switching loss determined with the measuring system. The measuring system consists primarily of two A/D converters. Dynamic characteristics of a thyristor, either of a normal type or high-speed type, can be quantitatively measured in one turn-on or turn-off operation. This article also discusses the effect of variation of the element area of the thyristor on the switching loss."

"The actual hardware realization of real-time digital filters has been so far carried out from the frequency-domain viewpoint based on the conventional transfer function method. However, when the digital system with multiple inputs and outputs is represented by the state variable method, then it becomes difficult to construct generally the digital filters by the transfer function method. This paper presents a direct realization of the real-time digital filter with n inputs and n outputs based on the state variable method. In this construction n unit delays are required, while n3 unit delays are required in the construction based on the transfer function method. Errors of the digital filter obtained thus are calculated on the basis of a noise model. As a result the filter realized on the basis of the state variable method is preferable in that it is simple in construction and noiseless in error. The actual hardware realization of the filter with two inputs and two outputs is given. As an example, the real-time digital filter is used as a simulator."

In 1934, H. S. Black [1] wrote a paper explaining the theory of the feedback principle and how stability of amplification as well as reduction of modulation distortion follow when stabilized feedback is applied to an amplifier. For example, Black proved experimentally that with negative feedback it was possible to control the gain of the amplifier to 0.01 dB with a change in plate voltage from 240 to 260 volts and maintain the modulation products at 75 dB below the signal output at full load."

"Differences between the measured thermal impedance of power transistors when determined by the pulsed heating curve and cooling curve techniques are discussed. These differences are shown to result primarily because the power density distributions of these devices change as devicesheat; as a result of these changes the heating curve and the cooling curve are not conjugate. It is shown that the cooling curve technique, when the cooling curve is initiated from the most non-uniform steady-state thermal, distribution, (maximum voltage, maximum power) will indicate a larger value for the thermal impedance than will the pulsed heating curve technique, even for pulses in excess of the dc power level. A one-dimensional model for power transistor cooling is described. The theoretical predictions of the model are shown to be in good agreement for practical applications with three-dimensional computer simulations and experimental results. Using this model, it is possible to estimate an average junction temperature and the area of power generation at steady-state.

The computer controls the dimension of the finished forging to 0.01 inch which necessitates overshoot compensation and per cent correction to prevent undersizing of the workpiece. Control of the manipulators involves rotational control in the continuous rotation and incremental angle rotation modes.

 "In the development of a microprocessor-based system, component and system checkout become a real problem. The microprocessor might be in one integrated circuit package while the random access and read-only memories occupy several different circuit packages. The data bits encoded into processor instructions, the data stored in random access memories, and the data from input/output devices all time share the same hardware circuitry. Under these conditions it is nearly impossible to locate a fault or series of faults using conventional engineering aides, such as oscilloscopes, meters, digital probes, etc. Our solution to the hardware checking out problem is to use a minicomputer for most of the checking out chores.

The numerical solutions of the nonlinear differential equations for the problem are presented. It is shown that the linear approximation does not supply a correct evaluation of response times. On the other hand, response times are one of the most important limitations in the use of thermistors as flowmeters. An accurate evaluation of these times and the establishment of a relation between response times and the ``thermal time constant'' are then attempted, in view of their applicative interest."
"The control of a process characterized by major \" pure time delay\" or \" transport lag\" by means of a coentonal analog controller is difficult because of the finite time which must elapse before a change in the controller output produces any measurable change in the process output. Linear predictor control is a well-known theoretical scheme for compensating the dead time; this requires incorporation of dead time in the controller itself and hardware difficulties have limited the use of this scheme in practice. It is shown in this paper that using an approximate-analog model of dead time synthesized from relatively inexpensive electronic components, a controller using the linear predictor approach is quite practicable in a typical process conatrol situation. A design of a control scheme for a laboratory process implementing the linear predictor control principle is given and it is shown that the improvement obtained in the control of the process, using an approximate analog model of dead time, is considerable."

"In this paper a new equivalent circuit for SCR's is proposed. This new equivalent circuit which contains a fictitious inductance is much more accurate and more suitable for digital computations of SCR circuits. A mathematical model which is derived from the equivalent circuit is used to compute the behavior of the SCR circuit. This circuit contains, in addition to SCR's a nonlinear universal series motor. The state equations of this nonlinear circuit have been derived and solved by the digital computer. The paper contains a flow chart of the algorithm and the computed results are presented."
"The paper describes a general digital computer program for the analysis of chopper-fed dc separately and series excited motors. The program does not require the prior knowledge of modes of operation of chopper circuit and the derivation of relevant equations (for each mode) and therefore, any chopper circuit can be analyzed. The different techniques have also been incorporated to make the computation fast."
"The dynamic model of a constant pressure water reservoir system is obtained. A design procedure, combining the classical compensating networks and parameter optimization techniques is presented. A performance characteristic constraint on the overshoot and settling time of the reservoir's height is assumed which implies the need of a lead compensator. The lead compensator's pole position is obtained by minimizing an integral square error cost function. The repeated-operation mode of the analog computer is used in an automatic parameter sweep method to find the optimum lead compensating network. The results obtained give the desired variation of the reservoir's height which is proportional to the pressure."
"The principle of operation of an ideal chopper circuit is discussed. Ideal chopper circuits and their output voltage wave-forms are presented. An ideal chopper circuit is utilized to get pulse-width modulated converter system and the converter circuit operation is discussed."
"The definition of power factor for general waveforms is reviewed. Several new quantities are defined, specifically rms, peak, and average wave factors. These are then related to power factor and crest factors. Methods for practical waveform characterization are developed, with emlphasis on the less general but more typical case of sinusoidal voltage drive with nonsinusoidal load current."
"From the literature published, six different gate firing schemes are available for three-phase thyristor Graetz bridge converters employing equidistant pulses. All these thyristor firing schemes have been developed with particular attention to the special control requirements of converters used in a high voltage dc transmission scheme. Herein is described a new simple equidistant pulse firing scheme intended to be economically quite competitive to the presently existing individual phase control circuits used in three-phase converter circuits for industrial applications. The princidple of operation and the circuit details of the firing circuit are described. Experimental results obtained on a laboratory dc drive of capacity 3 KVA are discussed."
"The work presented is a study of Emitter Coupled Astable Multivibrator. The output time period of this multivibrator is found to be linearly related with the coupling capacitance of the circuit. After the study of the circuit performance, thfe authors suggest that it can be used to obtain a signal conveying the information sensed by capacitive sensors. Also the signal is easy to be ransmitted and measured. The proposed circuit is realizable in IC form, minimizing the problems of shielding and stray capacitance if placed very close to the capacitive transducer."
"This paper deals with an analog computer simulation study of a complex drive system by making simplifying assumptions. The system incorporates a thyristor cycloconverter-type frequency-converter in the rotor circuit of a slip-ring induction motor for speed variation in subsynchronous as well as supersynchronous region by secondary voltage control. The action of the frequency converter is analogous to that of a normal commutator in a stator-fed ac commutator motor while the circuit behavior is similar to that of a cyclo-converter. A rotor position detector is used to switch the thyristor configuration in a sequential manner to generate an output voltage having a predominant slip-frequency component. Simulation involves solution of a set of generalized performance equations of an ideal induction machine in an appropriate reference frame under the control conditions imposed by the thyristor-commutator which is simulated using the parallel logic facilities of a modern analog computer. To simplify the simulation to study the system behavior, the thyristor units are represented by D/A switches available in the computer and the effects of source impedances are neglected. Results show very similar characteristics to the case when a pure sine-wave slip-frequency voltage is injected into the rotor as in the case of an ac commutator motr."
"A number of load waveforms, produced by switching elements in a single-phase supply to a resistance load, are analyzed. The power factor of the circuit is investigated and its relationship to power, distortion factor and fundamental power factor given. A number of particular switching modes are introduced to give leading power factors and certain harmonic elimination."
"The performance of the saturistor motor is improved by the addition of capacitors in the secondary circuit. The ac performance on run-up is changed considerably with increased torque production,reduced supply current and a power factor nearer to unity. DC dynamic braking is also influenced to the extent of increased braking torque, and reduced run-down times under comparable braking conditions. Braking using capacitor excitation is shown to be improved by the presence of saturistors. Analysis of the various modes of operation is discussed with acceptable prediction of the experimental characteristics."

  "When induction heating two-layer structures, such as a paint coated sheet steel, it is essential that the safe temperature limit of the paint shall not be exceeded. Only the outer surface, but not the paint-steel interface-is accessible to measurement.By controlling the constant temperature of the outer surface at two subsequent levels, it is possible to maintain a constant and known temperature gradient between surface and interface."
"This paper describes a motor control circuit for a dc motor using phase-locked loop techniques. The purpose of such a control loop is to provide very accurate speed control, repeatability, and synchronization capability."
"An on-off element with positive and negative variable triggering levels, magnitudes, and hysteresis is presented. It contains supplementary polarized Schmitt triggers and logic sequential devices built from discrete transistors and components or integrated circuits. Using this on-off element, it may be obtained in practice, all types of theoretic symmetrical and asymmetrical characteristics, inclusively that of an ideal on-off element, their totality being represented by a generalized characteristic. Depending on the hysteresis polarity, several types of peculiar generalized characteristics are distinguished. From each of them considering the triggering levels, the magnitudes and the hysteresis as variables, more peculiarized characteristics result. An example illustrates the application of the on-off element with generalized characteristic to a relay control system, in order to improve its stability and dynamic response."
"A method for using Kalman filtering techniques for improving data resolution is presented. The method uses a Taylor series process model which allows one to treat data from a variety of sources. Smoothing can also be included. The potential utility of the method lies in being able to trade off sensor cost versus computer processing. In some cases crude sensors coupled with the estimation techniques may yield as accurate data as would be obtained using more sophisticated sensors."
"The paper considers the control and the behavior of an asychronized synchronous machine. The d- and q-axis field excitation voltages are controlled to provide characteristics that combine the advantages of both syLchronous and induction machines. The properties are described with the aid of the phasor diagram, and expressions are presented for the synchronous and asynchronous components of the armature voltage, the active and reactive powers, and the torque. Experimental results for a 2 kVA machine are compared with calculated results for both steady-state and transient operation, and the action of the novel excitation system is described."
"Analysis of the turnoff process of SCR plays an important part in the design of SCR circuits. A simple computer model is developed to simulate the SCR turnoff process. This is based on the recovered charge characteristics given in the data sheets and the empirical results. Approximations involved in the simulation of stored charge are indicated. Computer analysis gives better understanding of the SCR reverse current, voltage and their effect on the circuit performance."

"The purpose of this article is to develop an efficient model for the analysis of a three-phase converter. An algorithm for the generation of a modified proper tree and fundamental cutset matrix from a network graph is developed, which utilizes much less computer storage space and computation time compared to the classical methods. A three-phase rectifier bridge with its associated protective circuits is considered and the results obtained from the developed technique are discussed."
"The paper presents a systematic and complete analysis of a commnonly used chopper circuit and develops a set of equations that govern the design of the circuit. Based on these equations a family of normalized design curves is obtained. A simple method to determine the values of the various components used in the circuit with the help of the normalized curves is also presented."
"In a companion paper, the analysis and design of a commonly used chopper circuit for controling the speed of slip-ring induction motor has been given. In order to overcome the disadvantages of that circuit, a modified version of the chopper circuit has been suggested and analyzed. The releveant points of difference between the design of the modified circuit and the original one have been indicated. Also the comparative merits and demerits of the two circuits have been discussed."
"The paper deals with the study of a constant frequency triggered, thyristor equipped, bistable circuit operating in the long time regime, i.e., in the regime which establishes in the circuit after applying a very great number of trigger pulses. By considering ideal thyristors and an ideal supply expressions are deduced for the instantaneous and final voltages across the commutating capacitor, the instantaneous current through the capacitor, the instantaneous and the average current through the thyristors and the supply, the reverse biasing times of the turning off thyristors and the rate of rise of thyristor forward voltage."
"A method is described whereby the cathode to ground capacitance of an RF sputtering module may be dramatically reduced, thereby cutting the power loss and improving the efficinecy. The technique uses a dc magnetic field, perpendicular to the RF electric field, thereby producing a cycloidal path for electrons and greatly increasing the extent of the Crookes dark space. It is shown that the applied magnetic field must be great enough to require the cycloidal height to be less than the desired dark space width. Experimental observations are described."
"The work presented is a study of a modified form of the astable multivibrator. The circuit presented gives a pulse frequency signal which can convey three different informations simultaneously. This simplifies the problem of transmission through overcrowded channels. The primary sensors for these informations can be voltage, potentiometric, resistive and strain-gauge-type transducers. Measurement of these informations at the receiving end is easy and simple. The transmitting and receiving circuits are realizable in the form of integrated circuits, thereby minimizing the cost and complexity of the system."
"A relatively simple programmable controller is described suitable for graphic data compression while at the same time providing a human operator with a means for steering and drawing within the stereo model formed in certain photogrammetric instruments. Lines joining coordinate points, circles, circular and parabolic arcs, and symbols in any orientation require only up to a few bytes of information for their execution. Symbols are preprogrammed into the controller from a telephone-type keyboard."
"This paper is concerned with the investigation of a feedforward control approach for a class of industrial systems which can be adequately modeled as a pure transport delay. The feedforward control loop is assumed to contain a sensor and actuator both with appreciable dynamics) as well as the feedforward controller. For this class of problems it turns out that application of the standard feedforward control approach leads to controllers which are, from a practical standpoint, unrealizable. The problem arises because the standard approach is based on an attempt to exactly cancel the effects of input disturbances. An alternate design approach is discussed in which a simple and easily realizable controller structure is assumed, and the controller parameters are chosen so that a suitable measure of system performance achieves a satisfactory value. The performance measure used is based on the frequency function relating the input disturbance spectrum to the output spectrum. This approach leads to some simple guidelines for choosing the feedforward controller parameters."

"To implement an electrically rewritable device for Read Mostly Memory applications, the structure of the FAMOS device is modified by incorporating an additional metal gate on top of the floating polysilicon gate and separated from it by a specially grown thermal oxide. Electrical erasure is accomplished by applying a positive voltage pulse to the metal gate. The \"write\" voltage has been lowered by using ion implantation. Reliability and charge retention are discussed and their impact on the design of the device is assessed. An empirical model for the conduction of oxide between the floating gate and the metal gate is developed and results are projected and compared with data obtained on the device."
"Electrically rewritable n-channel FAMOS devices were fabricated with a floating polycrystalline silicon gate and an Al control gate. The Al gate is used to control injection of holes or electrons from the avalanching drain diffusion onto the floating gate. Charge retention by the floating gate and device degradation due to multiple write/erase cycling is discussed."
"The dielectric breakdown of SiO2 films thermally grown on (100) silicon substrates was studied by the self-quenching technique, using thin aluminum field plates. The breakdown regions show distinct differences among the four possible combinations of substrate type and polarity of applied voltage. With p-type substrate and positive field-plate polarity, an anisotropy is observed which reflects the crystallo-graphic structure of the substrate. A pre-breakdown instability, which is enhanced at lowered temperatures, is ascribed to hole-electron pair production in the oxide followed by hole trapping at or near the negative electrode."
"X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is described in its application as a probe for studying defects such as sodium in SiO2 films. A general description is given of key experimental methods in XPS. New techniques are described for applying and monitoring a fixed bias at the surface of the oxide during the XPS measurement. These methods are shown capable of detecting extremely small Na and Cu concentrations in undoped samples (< 1011 cm-2). In deliberately Na-doped samples, five spectral peaks are distinctly observed and related to different defect states at the vacuum/SiO2 and SiO2/Si interfaces. By applying a bias-temperature stress during the XPS measurements, these peaks change in relative intensity and can be related to the motion of the Na+ ions between different states occurring at the two interfaces. An attempt is made to correlate the observations with previously reported models."
"An experimental method is described for measuring the density of oxide traps in the gate oxide of an MOS transistor as a function of energy and position near the silicon interface. Measurements are obtained from different oxide growth processes and after Co60 irradiation. The results are related to long-term drift of threshold voltage."
"A study of silicon and oxide profiles at the edges of silicon islands etched in silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) has shown that, following thermal oxidation of the silicon, a \" V\"- shaped groove forms between the silicon dioxide grown on the island edge and the sapphire substrate. This groove can cause etching and metal coverage anomalies at the island edges resulting in poor circuit yield and reliability."
"Formulas are presented for the maximum tensile stresses in the lid seal and the maximum lid deflections of a rectangular flat-pack under external pressure. These formulas can facilitate (a) the proper design of the package so that it will retain its hermeticity under a given screening pressure and (b) the selection of a proper pressure to use in the hermeticity screening of an already designed package. Information is also given on the approximate equivalence of external pressure and centrifuge acceleration in regard to the seal stresses and lid deflections of a rectangular flat-pack."
 "Parylene has been suggested for use and, in some cases, is used as a protective system for electronic components and assemblies, such as microcircuits. unfortunately, the amount of environmental test data for such parylene-protected components is quite limited and, to the authors' knowledge, almost no long-term test data exists. The principal objective of the test program reported in this paper was to determine whether it is at all reasonable to use parylene as a protective system for microcircuits in place of a hermetic seal in high-reliability equipment. A radiation-hardened circuit containing nichrome resistors was selected as a test specimen because of its considerable sensitivity to humidity-induced failure. The ceramic encased circuits were mounted on carrier cards, delidded, and coated with parylene C at three different facilities (Vendors A, B, and C). The cleaning cycle, the adhesion promotor, and the thickness of the parylene coating appifed differed from vendor to vendor, depending on the practices considered appropriate by the particular coating facili-ty at the time. The circuits were operated in a ring-counter configuration during humidity tests. Nonparylened units both with and without lids were also tested as controls, and other parylene-coated control units were kept in a dessicator. Units which had been coated by Vendor C had a hifgher failure rate than even the unprotected units. This is attributed to the adhesion promoter used. The failure modes exhibited by Vendor-C parts were: (1) Nichrome voiding at the nichrome/aluminum interface. (2) Nichrome voiding in the bulk of the nichrome resistors."
"The purpose of this investigation was to determine if there was a detrimental effect on internal bonded wires of ceramic dual-in-line and ceramic flat packages, which had been subjected to thermal cycling for up to 1000 cycles. Several manufacturers' parts were used - three ceramic dual-in-line packages (CDIP) and two flat packages. All parts were stressed to MIL-STD-883, Method 1010, Condition C (-65°C. to +150°C) or Method 1011, Condition C. Samples were removed at various steps throughout the cycling program. All parts were decapped and wires pulled. Pull strength and failure locations were recorded. This investigation indicated that end-of-life due to temperature cycling, can be observed to start within 1000 cycles, but due to the slow mean degradation rate, the calculated mean cycles to failure is very large (>1018 cycles). Thermal shock cause much less degradation of the wire bond strengths than did temperature cycling at this condition C level. The results show that Method 1010-C does cause slight degradation in mean pull strength, almost no degradation in maximum value observed, and extensive degradation to lowest values observed. Zero wirepull strengths were obtained after 240 temperature cycles and \"percent fail less than 0.5 gram-force\" increases significantly with increasing cycles from 240 to 1000. The purpose of the second part of this investigation was to determine if there was a degradation in CERDIP sealing glass strength of parts subjected to 1000 cycles of MIL-STD-883, Method 1011, Condition A (0 - 100°C) Thermal Shock."
"Analysis of broken ultrasonic Al-Ag bonds involving SEM electron microprobe, ion microprobe, and Auger electron spectroscopy indicated that failure was due to corrosion. Subsequent environmental tests demonstrated that Al-Ag bonds are highly susceptible to corrosion, but Al-Au and Au-Al bonds are less so. No evidence of corrosion of Au-Ag bonds was found."
"The temperature dependence of the growth rates of intermetallic compounds in the Cu-Sn, Ag-Sn and Ni-Sn systems was determined between 100°C and 213°C for Sn-dipped and Sn-plated samples. Below 175°C the fastest growing intermetallic compound was Ag3Sn. The Ni-Sn compoknd, Ni3Sn, was the slowest growing phase below 150°C, but the fastest growing phase above 175°C. The two Cu-Sn intermetallic phases, Cu3Sn and Cu6Sn5, had a combined growth rate which increases more slowly with temperature than the single intermetallic phases observed in the Ni-Snand Ag-Sn systems. The growth rate data plotted against reciprocal temperature satisfies the Arrhenius relationship and yields a range of apparent activation energies between 14.8 Kcal/mole for Ag3Sn and 37.6 Kcal/mole for Ni3Sn4. The growth of intermetallic compounds can affect the reliability of electronic parts through a reduction in lead solderability or a decrease in the mechanical strength of soldered connections. Lap shear testing of metal strips bonded with Sn demonstrated that strengths of both bonded Ni and Cu strips decrease as the thickness of the intermetallic compounds increase during annealing at 213°C. In the case of Ni-Sn, a 50% reduction in joint strength occurred after only one day-at temperature. For Cu-Sn, the reduction in joint strength occurred at a slower rate, and only a slight decrease was observed in the Ag-Sn lap shear samples. The degradation observed in the Ni-Sn and Cu-Sn systems is related to the growth rate of brittle intermetallics forming at the interface (i.e. Ni3Sn4 and Cu3Sn)."
"Previous studies of the basic failure mechanisms of conventional plastic-encapsulated integrated circuits have led to improvements in materials and processes which have yielded two orders of magnitude improvement in reliability. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that, where severe environmental conditions are encountered, enhanced reliability is provided by device surfaces passivated with a silicon nitride dielectric and metallized with a titanium, platinum, gold interconnecting system. Failures associated witlh gold electro-plating under severe humidity-bias conditions are avoided by the deposition of a dielectric layer over tlle metallizationi pattern. Subsequent thermal, electrical, and moisture stress testinig his confirmed earlier indications that predicted lifetimes greater than 107 hours can be anticipated for these types of initegrated circuits when they are operated at a maximuim rated temperature of 125°C. An automated duial-in-linle-package assembly system has been evaluated that provides plastic packages in which the convenitional wire bonds have been eliminated and replaced with thermocom-pression bonds of metal beams to both the device and the lead-frame bond sites. The advantages gained from this type of assembly system are discussed."
"Failures, failure modes and failure mechanisms related to the formation of migrated-gold resistive shorts (MGRS) in gold-metallized microcircuits will be described. Also, three different methods of screening devices for MGRS will be presented and the impact MGRS can have on device reliability will be discussed."
"Integrated-circuit devices using the Ti/W/Au metal system are subject to failure mechanisms based on electrolytic corrosion. The migratory gold resistive short (MGRS) failure mode is one example of this mechanism and results in the formation of filamentary or dendritic deposits of gold between adjacent stripes. on the IC chip. This reaction requires the presence of a sufficient amount of water, a bias voltage between adjacent stripes, and the activation of the cathodic (-) stripe. Gold ions are transported from anode to cathode through a film of moisture adsorbed on the surface of the chip; halide ions are probably involved in the transfer. Their presence is verified experimentally by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Some of the chemical and electrostatic factors involved in the MGRS mechanism are discussed in this paper, including the questions of a threshold level of moisture and contamination."
"Experiments are carried out to understand the electromigration-induced failure mechanism in thin-film Au conductors. The activation energy for the atom transport and the magnitude of the current exponent In the failure equation are obtained. The role of surface coverage on the reliability of AU stripes is studied. The underlying mode of atom transport and the possible sources of flux divergences are discussed in terms of these results."
"Microwave power transistors in a radar-system may undergo ~ 1011 fast heating and cooling cycles during lifetime. Controlled temperature cycling tests have been carried out on Al, passivated Al, and gold metallization systems using both a special test pattern and commercially available transistors. Significant visible and electrical changes were observed for Al, glassed Al and a laboratory Ta-Pt-Ta-Au system, but not for a commercial gold transistor."
"An n-channel FET memory array chip whose quartz passivation layer is purposely disrupted in specific-nonrandom locations is used to study the propensity of these induced defects to fail due to localized inversion of the silicon surface stemming from positive ions contained within the defect which are residual from processing. Two distinct sizes of induced defects are considered; three and seven micron diamters; 800 of the larger size and 100 of the smaller. Vertical structures range from shallow indentations to holes completely-through the passivation layer thus exposing the underlying silicon. Positive ionic contamination is introduced into the defects via an overcoat of photoresist whose positive ionic species and levels are known. Accelerated temperature and voltage life stresses are performed. Temperatures employed are 85 and 150°C, while voltage levels (and E field) across the defect are nominal and twice nominal. Data obtained from these temperature/voltage accelerated stresses is presented which shows time-to-fail is related to the ionic (mostly sodium) levels contained within the defects. Voltage acceleration was found to be a nonlinear function while temperature follows the standard Arrhenius model with an activation energy of 1.1 eV. Hole size was found to be at best a second order effect on time-to-fail. High temperature no bias bake-out at 150°C for 48 hours was performed. Percent inversion is seen to decrease by approximately an order of magnitude in all cases."
"This paper reviews the results of deposited glass layer analysis carried out during device failure analysis and characterization studies performed at the Rome Air Development Center. The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used as the principal analysis technique for this study. The variables under consideration were glass deposition method, device interconnect metallurgy, package type and device stress conditions. The effects of glass layer defects on device reliability are discussed along with qualification and screen tests aimed at eliminating batch-related problems."
"The metal-polysilicon-doped silicon butting contact is presently widely used in MOS silicon gate integrated circuits because it occupies minimum area on the chip and does not require additional photolithography. A possible failure mechanism of this contact with self-aligned, ion-implanted sources and drains has been observed. Recent data obtained on processes used to fabricate two-phase, two-level polysilicon CCDs are presented. Results show that oxide etching under the edges of the polysilicon gate during contact window definition can lead to excessive leakage due to metal-to-substrate shorts at the metal-polysilicon-doped silicon butting contact."
"A technique is described which uses straightforward electrical measurement procedures to determine the peak junction temperature of power transistors. To determine the peak temperature, standard electrical measurement techniques are altered to account for the difference between the distributions of the calibration and measurement currents in the active area of the device. For relatively uniform temperature distributions, the electrically determined peak junction temperature is only about 6% or less below the infrared measured peak temperature whereas the standard electrically measured temperature is about 10 to 25% below the infrared measured peak temperature. For severely non-uniform temperature distributions, when only about 20% of the total active area of the device is dissipating power at steady state, the electrically determined peak temperature is within 11% of the infrared measured peak temperature while the standard electrically measured temperature is more than 40% below the infrared measured peak temperature. Device operating conditions for which the junction temperature as determined by standard electrical methods, infrared techniques, and the electrical peak temperature technique equals the manufacturer's specified maximum safe operating temperature are compared with one another and with the manufacturer's specified safe operating limits. It is suggested that the electrical peak temperature technique can be used to generate more realistic safe operating area limits and to determine the validity of specified safe operating limits of power transistors."
"The electromigration lifetimes of thin-film Al-Cu, Al-Cu-Si, and Ag conductors were measured as a function of stripe width. Both the median lifetime and the standard deviation of the lognormal failure distribution were observed to depend strongly on the stripe width; this finding indicates that a narrower stripe is less reliable. This width dependence is interpreted in terms of the microstructural characteristics of the films."
"A scanned surface photovoltage (SSP) method is capable of detecting a wide variety of defects in a silicon surface. This method can be used to scan a large area of the silicon surface, which is coupled by a surface channel to a small remote electrode. The resolution obtained, about 2 μm, is explained theoretically in this paper for the case of a differentiated photovoltage signal and a small (0.8 μm diameter) light beam from an optimized optical system. SSP images of a variety of defects, both naturally occurring and induced, were obtained along with images produced by other methods for comparison."
"Devices from two separate PROM manufacturers utilizing nichrome technology were subjected to variations in programming pulses to determine effects on the fusible links. After programming, devices were chemically etched and a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis was conducted on the selectively programmed fuses. A rectangular pulse corresponding to the vendors programming specification was used to program the fuses. However, during programming the pulse amplitude was adjusted to simulate the effect of variations in energy levels delivered by the on-chip addressing circuitry to the fusible links. The amplitudes were adjusted to extend the time required for fusing to a range of 100 μs to several seconds. Under SEM examination, the appearance of the fused gaps could be correlated to the fusing time during programming. A description of experiments performed, along with SEM photographs-are presented."
"Reliability life tests of rf power transistors during pre-production evaluation of advanced design avionics distance measuring equipment (DME) have revealed two primary failure mechanisms affecting the transistors used in this 1 GHz pulse power application. The mechanisms are: 1. dissolution of silicon in aluminum, with subsequent hillock formation in the emitter metallization, and 2. aluminum grain swelling, both mechanisms resulting in base-emitter degradation. These results have been verified by SEN and electrical tests based on rf pulse power life tests on the DME equipment and from failures in field test environments. Several corrective measures have been implemented by semiconductor manufacturers as a consequence of aluminum electromigration failures in preliminary carrier wave (CW) life tests. Additional corrective measures on these devices were necessary to eliminate the failure mechanisms seen in the 1 GHz pulse power environment to which these transistors were subjected. A recent 5000 hour pulse power life test substantiates that degradation has not occurred in transistors incorporating the design corrections."
"Four types of microwave transistors were tested for D. C. electromigration under accelerated to typical use conditions. A lower activation energy was obtained along with a larger preexponential constant and smaller exponent for current density for the typical electromigration equation. Three of the transistor types were also run in an operational life test at 2.0GHz. After 5,000 hours of testing, the beginnings of a correlation between the D.C. and R.F. testing have appeared. Also oscillators have failed; while amplifiers have not. Power cycling of gold lead wires has shown no fatigue deterioration of the wires or bonds. Temperature step stress showed a semiconductor device cannot be used above its eutectic temperature. A computer model is used to calculate operating temperature at high case temperature and power loading, where actual measurements are difficult to make and intrepret."
"It has been demonstrated that failures of gallium arsenide field effect transistors often occur at the sites of minor manufacturing defects. SEN and optical examination can be used to reject devices with such defects. Failure may often be traced to energy pulses which cause expulsion of material from localized areas. Failures caused by positive and negative pulses have distinctive characteristics: positive pulses on the gates tend to cause failures close to the gate bonding pads, or at regions of high gate resistance; negative pulses tend to cause failures at manufacturing defects. The damage may not cause the devices to go out of electrical specification but will seriously reduce their expected life."
"A comprehensive study of the long life and reliability characteristics of a hermetically sealed GaAsP LED has been performed using accelerated life test techniques. A degradation model was developed based on the Arrhenius equation which was found to describe a lognormal failure distribution. The Extended-Longini failure mechanism was expanded to include the effects of crystalline dislocations."
"Prior to the onset of long-term degradation, noticeable increases in the external quantum efficiency of zinc-diffused GaAs electroluminescent diodes have been observed and characterized. Such appreciation behavior may exist for several thousand hours of device operation and is dependent on both the relative strength of the stress condition as well as the initial emitted light intensity of the particular device. This anomalous behavior has been determined to be caused by increases in the intrinsic quantum efficiency within the P region of the device. Both pulsed and direct current stress conditions have been examined to characterize this behavior."
"The degradation of radiant power output (Po) for silicon doped GaAs infrared emitting diodes was established for dc current stress levels ranging from 70 to 175 A/cm2. Through an analysis of the forward I-V data and specially performed tests, it was de-termined that the initial degradation was due to increases in the space charge recom-bination current while later degradation was due to decreases in the diffusion current. The initial changes in the space charge recombination current were caused by the diffusion of zinc atoms to the junction region via the Longini mechanism. Zinc diffusion also resulted in an initial increase in Po both under stress and room temperature storage conditions. The mechan-ism responsible for the decrease in the diffusion current was not identified, but most probably involved the silicon dopant atoms."

 "Resistors: A review of resistor systems, and the processes used to deposit and delineate them, is given. Effects of mechanical, thermal, chemical and electrical stresses are discussed as they relate to accuracy and stability. Failure mechanisms are reviewed. Triming techniques are explored and design limits for the various systems discussed. Parameters of interest such as frequency response, temperature coefficient, voltage coefficient and noise are compared for the various systems. Finally, quality control and screening techniques are discussed as they relate failure mechanisms and package quality and reliability control."
   "High temperature operating life test gives quick feedback on the processes used in fabrication of semiconductor wafers. The relatively high failure rate of the (so-called) freaks is quickly demonstrated in such a test and can indicate a marginal or out of control process. This method of process control concentrates on the initial fallout as a means of determining the reliability of final products. Greater than 150°C stress temperatures should not be applied to plastic encapsulated devices. Since most epoxies have glass transition temperatures in the range of 150°C to 180°C permanent damage to the package could result."

"The principal aim of this paper has been to investigate two structural characteristics of complex organizations which were hypothesized to influence the use of staff conferences: (1) the manager's position in the hierarchy of authority, and (2) the degree to which the manager by virtue of his position is exposed to contingencies. The hypotheses were based on the assumption that these structural characteristics entail coordinative activities which are handled, in part, in the context of the staff conference. Data were gathered by questionnaire and analyzed for 680 managers of a large industrial and engineering organization. Hierarchical status was found to be strongly related to staff-conference utilization. The data suggest that top-level managers employ the conference in order to coordinate their activities, and first-line supervisors may employ proportionately more spontaneous contacts and meetings to accomplish their duties. Contingency exposure was found to be only weakly related to staff-conference utilization. Several social-psychological and structural variables were introduced as control variables. The original relationships were not greatly influenced by these controls, however the procedure disclosed some small but suggestive differences in the partial relationships. For example, it was found that spontaneous consultations did not serve as substitutes for staff conferences; high-level executives did not reduce their staff conference use; and, in fact, the first-line supervisors slightly increased their utilization of staff conferences. The weak relationships between contingency exposure and staff-conference utilization may be explained in various ways."

"In recent years there has been a significant expansion in the individualization of instruction from the elementary school to the University, as well as in technical and industrial training. Attempts to introduce individualized instruction often have been thwarted by the sudden emergence of a complex and time-constrained allocation of resources problem in an area where little or no management expertise was previously required. In this paper, an attempt has been made to develop a mathematical model of individualized instruction. Representation of the process both as a flow graph and as a state space has been considered. Serious questions of stationarity arose when an attempt was made to handle statistically the \"free\" choice of individual human beings. An attempt is now being made to run an interactive management information system concurrent with an ipdividualized course, thus providing a means of directly modifying the operation of the simulation by the actions and decisions of the human participants. It is expected that after such a \"participative simulation\" is run concurrent with several courses, it will result in a useful and pre-validated mathematical model and computer simulation for the planning and management of individualized instruction."
"A finite-horizon partially observed stochastic optimization problem is presented, where the underlying (or core) process subject to control is a finite-state discrete-time controlled semi-Markov vector process, the information pattern is classical, and times of control reset and noise corrupted observation occur at times of core process transition. Conditions for optimality are stated. The new problem formulation is shown to generalize several well-known problem formulations. Cost equality and inequality results associated with observation quality are determined, and the subsequent simplified dynamic programming equations obtained. Particular attention is given to cases where not all elements of the vector core process are either completely observed or completely unobserved."
"Most of investment analysis involves decision making by weighing evidence. Such decision processes can be formalized with the aid of pattern recognition (PR) techniques. Specifically, we have applied generalized perceptron-type PR techniques to both general market forecasting and investment selection. And after the investment decision system has been implemented and put into operation, its performance is then gradually improved through learning from previous decision making experiences. Iterative probabilistic learning algorithms (based on stochastic approximation techniques) have been used. Decision models for both investment selection and market forecasting have been realized and tested in actual investment analysis. The experimental results indicate that with the aid of PR techniques we may obtain above average investment performance."
"The possibility of gaining storage space is an argument often advanced in favor of permitting question-answering systems to make occasional errors. Absolute bounds are established on the amount of memory savings that is achievable with a specified error level for certain types of question-answering systems. Question-answering systems are treated as communication channels carrying information concerning the acceptable answers to an admissible set of queries. Shannon's rate-distortion theory is used to calculate bounds on the memory required for several question-answering tasks. For data retrieval, pattern classification, and position-matching systems, it was found that only small memory gains could be materialized from error tolerance. In pair-ordering tasks, on the other hand, more significant memory savings could be accomplished if small error rates are tolerated."
"The propensity automaton is an automaton whose state itself gives the probability distribution over the outputs. This paper gives the background that has led the author to the idea of a propensity automaton and explains the differences between the propensity automaton, fuzzy automaton, and stochastic automaton. Fuzzy logic and propensity logic are compared, and it will be explained how the propensity logic becomes a nondistributive logic. This paper is not intended to be a logically tight systematic exposition, but rather a narrative, at times tutorial, explanation of the motivation of an idea."
"The outlines of handwritten numerals are approximated by polygons using a method previously developed by Pavlidis and Horowitz [10]. This enables a simple evaluation of many intuitively descriptive features for numerals, for example, relative position and type of concave arcs. The method was tested on the Munson data (IEEE Data Base 1.2.2), and an overall error rate of 9.4 percent was achieved without any statistical optimization. A characteristic property of this approach is the existence of two steps: the first step (primitive feature generation) is primarily numerical, and the second step (feature selection and classification) makes extensive use of semantics."

"A pattern recognition approach to the automatic testing of loaded transmission lines is investigated. The pattern recognition technique selected allows automatic testing of a loaded line requiring, as data, only the magnitude of the input impedance of the line over the frequencies of interest. For standard voice quality lines, these frequencies lie between 200-4000 Hz. Thirty-two features are automatically extracted from the input impedance and used as the input to a minimum-mean-square weighted distance classifier. The classifier determines the nature and location of the line fault, if any, for the line under test. Twenty different line configurations or classes are experimentally investigated. A training set of five lines for each line class is used to obtain statistical data for each class. Thirty-six transmission lines are then tested. All 36 of these transmission lines were correctly identified as to the configuration of the line and the nature and location of any existing fault."
"A procedure is developed for fitting a large (>3) number of arbitrarily chosen experimental data points to a fractional linear transformation on a complex plane. The transformation coefficients as well as their standard deviations are computed directly from the set of measured impedances or reflection coefficients, without any resort to graphical procedures. The procedure can be applied to linear reciprocal two-ports."
"A mode of operation of astable and monostable multivibrators which has received little attention is discussed. The timing of the quasi-stable states in this mode is determined by an RC network as for the conventional two-transistor astable or monostable multivibrator. However, the timing is determined by the network associated with the \"on\" transistor, rather than the \"off\" transistor. The analysis of the basic symmetrical on-mode circuit considers design requirements and period stability. Comparison is made with the conventional off-mode multivibrator."
"A new technique is presented which makes it possible to measure the inherent short-term stability of quartz crystal resonators in a passive circuit. Comparisons with stability measurements made on crystal controlled oscillators indicate that noise in the electronics of the oscillators very seriously degrades the inherent stability of the quartz resonators for times less than 1 s. A simple model appears to describe the noise mechanism in crystal controlled oscillators and points the way to design changes which should improve their short-term stability by two orders of magnitude. Calculations are outlined which show that with this improved short-term stability it should be feasible to multiply a crystal controlled source to 1 THz and obtain a linewidth of less than 1 Hz. In many cases, this improved short-term stability should also permit a factor of 100 reduction in the length of time necessary to achieve a given level of accuracy in frequency measurements."
"For years, engineers and scientists have been plagued by an extremely undesirable property of the quartz crystal unit-its significant frequency shift as a function of drive level for drive levels in excess of 10 to 100 μW. This fact was reported by Hammond [1]. As a result, all precision and moderate precision quartz oscillators have been operated at low drive in an effort to avoid the phenomena. The author has discovered, however, that this unique property of the quartz resonator can be effectively utilized in the design of the quartz oscillator with the result of substantial improvement in oscillator short-term frequency stability. Futhermore, since the crystal frequency-drive characteristic is repeatable, maintenance of moderately high crystal drive in the oscillator circuit will not result in long-term frequency instability in excess of that required for the majority of radar and communication systems [2]."
"Further discussion of a lumped capacitance method for measurement of the permittivity and conductivity of materials in the radio and microwave frequency ranges is presented. The analysis of the method applicable in both frequency and time domains is given for materials having low frequency conductivity or Debye dispersion."
"It is shown that very high accuracy hybrid packaged dual-ramp analog-to-digital converters can be built using ceramic NPO-type chip capacitors that exhibit a dielectric absorption specification of 0.75 percent. Capacitor recovery voltage is shown versus time for several 0.01-/g-m/F NPO-type ceramic capacitors. An absorptive capacitor model for the NPO capacitor is shown. Typical component values for an absorptive model of an 0.01-/g=m/F NPO capacitor are determined. The worst case integrator error due to dielectric absorption in a particular synchro-to-digital converter utilizing two dual-ramp converters with 0.01-/g=m/F integrator capacitors is shown to be in the order of microvolts."
"This article describes some problems concerning the measurement of the Hall mobility of semiconductor layers. A method is proposed by which the measurement of relevant parameters is automated. The introduction into the system of a low-cost desk calculator allows for considerable increase in accuracy and yields on-line computation capability."
"The use of optical and electromagnetic current transformers for protection and measurement in EHV transmission systems is outlined along with salient specifications imposed by diversification of present-day applications. Basic principles of operation and typical applications of optical and electromagnetic current transformers are presented."
"A new method is described that will measure and locate the source of structural return loss in transmission lines in the presence of mismatch between the measuring bridge impedance and the average characteristic impedance of the transmission line. A conceptual measurement system that realizes the described method is also presented."
"In a magnetic resonance spectrometer, a marginal oscillator is used as a transducer to convert a minute change in the tank coil resistance into a change in the amplitude of oscillation. Thus one can define a conversion gain as the ratio of the fractional change in the amplitude of oscillation to the fractional change in the tank coil resistance. Since the change in the tank coil resistance is made periodic at a low frequency to facilitate phase-sensitive detection, a study of the transient behavior of the oscillator becomes important. In this paper, the conversion gain, bandwidth, and noise associated with the oscillator are studied as functions of the circuit parameters, utilizing a piecewise linear characteristic for the active device. Unlike the studies carried out by other authors making use of a polynomial expansion for the nonlinear characteristic, the piecewise linear characteristic has been chosen because it is more amenable to synthesis. The sensitivity of the amplitude of oscillation to the variation of the characteristics of the active device has also been evaluated, and the relationship between the stability requirement of the device characteristics and the conversion gain has been established."
"A new method of measurement of complex dielectric constant of thin films of high-permittivity materials at microwave range of frequencies is suggested. The experimental sample is in the form of a planar condensor supported by means of (λ/2)g substrate inside the waveguide. ϵ of the sample is found by noting the resonant frequency, and tgδ is obtained from the reflection coefficient of the resonance-tuned system. A working equation for the capacitor is derived with help of conformal mapping. The applicability of the method has been verified with an experimental sample of BaTiO3."
"A versatile direct converter of fluid thermal parameters into frequency and time is described. The circuit is based on a complementary multivibrator, the frequency of which is controlled by the temperature-sensitive current generator. Temperature-to-time (θ-T) and temperature-to-frequency (θ-f) conversion is obtained by simple rearranging of passive circuit elements. The linearizing conditions and sensitivity for various probe configurations are given. In battery telemetering systems, the circuit is economical in power supply consumption due to the very small mark-to-space ratio of output pulses. The sensitivity as well as the transducer Rmax/Rmin ratio are considerably increased in comparison with other direct thermistor converters. With the positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistor probe, the frequency change can be about three decades in the temperature range of 30°C, which represents the highest obtained sensitivity of θ-T/f converters. The circuit is also successfully applied with self-heated miniature bead thermistors as a sensor when it represents the linearized air speed-to-time converter within the range of 0-3.6 m/s."
"The article describes a digital hardware used for the measurements of noise power in a telephone channel in accordance to the CCIR recommendations for radio-relay links. The described digital system avoids the impairments of the previously used analogue systems. Finally, it is shown how the hardware can easily be turned into a digital real RMS measuring instrument."
"A new level crossing counter is described. This counter gives the true level crossing rate of a random waveform imbeded in high frequency noise. It can be useful in monitoring or studying envelope fadings such as Rayleigh fading or log-normal fading."

"An apparatus for evaluating the thermal transient behavior of an electroexplosive device is described. The thermal response provides nondestructive testing insight with respect to device design and behavior. Abnormal responses may be indicative of imminent failure and the apparatus provides a rapid evaluation method for quality control."
"A direct method of measuring delay and estimating the mean delay is described. The accuracy possible is examined theoretically. A method for minimizing the variance of the estimated mean delay is derived. Methods of estimating the entire probability distribution of the measured delay are discussed and statistically analyzed."
"In this paper, a principle for absolute voltage division is presented. The division ratio of a voltage divider on this principle does not depend on the values of its elements but depends exclusively on the configuration of the divider network. Hence, calibration is not necessary and not even possible. Absolute voltage division is obtained by cyclically shifting the network elements along all positions in the divider network. Each position is maintained for an equally long time interval. The average output voltage of such a dynamic divider is identical to that of a static divider with the same network configuration but composed of elements which all have the same value. To verify the principle in practice, a digitally controlled resistive voltage divider has been built. It has been realized with easily available electronic components, such as carbon resistors with ± 5-percent tolerance, junction field-effect transistors as electronic switches and digital integrated circuits for the generation of the switch drive signals. The inaccuracy of this divider is less than 5 ×10-6 and the temperature coefficient of the division ratio is less than 5 × 10-8/°C from 0°C to 40°C. It is expected that the performance, of this prototype can be improved."
"A differential method to measure, simply and accurately, the equivalent series inductance (ESL) and the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of energy discharge capacitors is described and compared with other available methods. The differential method measures the ESL over a wide range of inductance, including extremely low inductance values, without elaborate equipment or intricate data interpretation. The differential method also determines the ESR of fast energy capacitors at frequencies approaching the capacitor self-resonant frequency."
"The amplifier presented in this paper is suitable for isolated acquisition of analog signals in the frequency range from dc to more than 10 MHz. It employs a combination of magnetic and optical isolation techniques which gives to the circuit good features of speed and precision."
"A substantial discrepancy was found to exist between the sigma (standard deviation) of the noise present in radar data as determined by subtraction of data smoothed by a low-pass filter from the raw data and use of successive differences to isolate the noise. An investigation revealed that implicit in the equation based on the successive differences approach was the assumption that the noise was white, bandlimited, and with a cutoff frequency equal to the Shannon frequency. Hence, analyses were performed to take into account other situations, namely: band-limited white noise having a cutoff frequency less than the Shannon frequency; white noise modified by an RC filter; and spurious sinusoidal signal present. By taking into account these various types of noise spectra, it was possible to obtain excellent agreement between the two methods for measuring the noise sigmas."
"The phase-locked loop (PLL) is applied to generating and measuring large phase jitter that can be encountered in digital transmission systems. It is shown that jitter can be generated and measured by a PLL operated as a phase modulator and phase demodulator, respectively. Equations and examples are given for practical PLL designs to generate and measure jitter of a certain amplitude range and bandwidth. Practical considerations such as 1) phase detector range, 2) limited voltage-controlled oscillator sensitivity, 3) frequency tolerances, 4) pull-in time, and 5) calibration are included. PLL's designed in this way can be useful in evaluating digital transmission systems. Jitter measuring sets have been designed to measure jitter on the 1.5, 6.3, 45, and 274 Mbit/s signals used in the LD-4 digital cable system [1]. A jitter set for measuring jitter on 45 Mbit/s signals is described in this paper."
"A theoretical model is developed for a pendulum-variable inductance ac RL bridge type velocity gauge. Lagrange's equations and an extension of a solution to a restricted form of Navier-Stokes' equations are used to develop the mechanical-fluidic portion of the model. Ampere's circuital law and Kirchhoff's laws are the basis for the magnetic-electrical portion of the model. State variables are defined and the overall model state equations written. A computer simulation of the model compares favorably with experimental results for the unforced case. The simulation also illustrates nonlinear damping effects as well as maximum and linear operating ranges for the gauge."
"Electrode surface effects in parallel-plate capacitors lead to a variation in capacitance and conductance with frequency. A method is presented for the determination of absolute changes in capacitance and absolute values of conductance, as functions of frequency. The method involves the use of two variable parallel-plate capacitors, and requires the measurement of relative capacitance and conductance values over a range of frequencies and at a minimum of two different electrode spacings. A capacitor cell, incorporating two variable capacitor sections is described. The cell is designed for use in the investigation of the frequency characteristics of a range of electrode surfaces. Two current transformer ratio-arm bridges are used to perform the relative admittance measurements. The bridges are compensated for capacitance loading, and together cover the frequency range 11 Hz-52 kHz. Measurement precision is a few parts in 108 for each admittance component. Details of the bridges and measurement techniques are discussed and corrections for mechanical resonance effects and lead impedances are considered. Results are given for rhodium plated and plain brass electrodes under vacuum. Over the full frequency range the fractional capacitance change for rhodium, when referred to a 1-mm electrode spacing, is <4 × 10-7. Tan δ is < 1.5 × 10-7. Oil films and organic contaminants on electrode surfaces are thought to be the most likely sources of frequency dependence."
"This paper describes a new solid state circuit for resistance measurement in the range 1-108 Ω. The advantages of this circuit include: reliability, simplicity of design and use, low cost, and the fact that resistance scale is linear. The accuracy of measurement is around ±2 percent of reading at full-scale value in the range 1-106 Ω and ±6 percent of reading at 10 MΩ and 100 Mg. This circuit is temperature-compensated and exhibits good operational stability. The constructional cost of the instrument is about $41.00."
"This paper presents two types of active configurations for realizing electronically tunable RC sinusoidal oscillators. The type-1 network employs two grounded scaled resistances KR1 and KR2, where K is a scaling factor. The frequency of oscillation Wo is controlled conveniently by adjusting K, since Wo appears in the form W0 = l/K/√R1C1R2C2. For realizing the scaled resistances, an active configuration is proposed, which realizes KRi = Ri/1 + f(VB), where f(VB) denotes a function of a controlling voltage VB. Thus the frequency tuning can be effected by controlling a voltage VB. The type-2 oscillator uses two periodically switched conductances. It is shown that the tuning of oscillation frequency can be done by varying the pulsewidth-to-period ratio (τ/T) of the periodically switched conductances."
"This paper describes the influence of the parallel capacitance of a quartz-crystal resonator on the amplitude-frequency coupling and particularly on the internal noise spectra of the oscillator working at the series resonance. A theoretical analysis which is a first order perturbation method is used. It is shown that the parallel capacitance of the quartz-crystal resonator increases the amplitude-frequency coupling and drastically modifies both amplitude and phase spectra of the internal noise. The 1/f2 phase spectrum of the internal thermal noise is transformed into a white phase spectrum for noise component frequencies greater than f0 + f² or less than f0 - fΔ, where f0 is the resonator series resonant frequency and fΔ, the difference between antiresonant and resonant frequencies of the quartz crystal. A \"noise quieting\" phenomenon appears when the noise component frequencies are in the vicinity of the antiresonant frequency fp. A good agreement between theoretical and experimental results for different values of the parallel-capacitance proves the validity of the mathematical model."
"This paper describes a slow-scan vidicon camera and reports applieations in the field of picture processing and representation of luminescence spectra. A PDP 8/I small computer, interfaced to the camera, collects and stores the data under software control. The picture is decomposed in 256 × 256 elements which are digitally processed. Weak signals from static images can be integrated during prolonged periods. Programs for the display of pictorial and spectral information have been written."
"Cosmic background noise temperature measurements which were made at 13.05-cm wavelength (2297 MHz) resulted in an experimental value of [266 ± 0.77 (3σ)] K. The two largest error sources were due to uncertainties in the calibration of the liquid helium cooled termination and the antenna transmission line. The 2.66 K value is in good agreement with the currently accepted value of 2.8 K. Measurements were made at 2297-MHz space communications frequency because cosmic background noise is an important consideration in the calculations of expected signal-to-noise ratios for spacecraft and ground receiving systems."
"The temperature and pressure coefficients of three buffer gases, N2, Ar, Kr, commonly used in passive Rb57 frequency standards have been accurately determined. Techniques for filling cells reproducibly, are described. From the results obtained, calculations are made on the expected characteristics of gas mixtures. Graphs are given which can be used to select the proper buffer gas mixture and pressure to obtain specially required frequency shift and temperature coefficient in a given cell."
"Statistical error estimates of spectrum analysis are given for any number of degrees of freedom and any relative passband width for continuous line and mixed spectra. The continuous component is assumed to be normal but not necessarily white."
"A unique method for the continuous measurement of electric-arc duration is presented. By using the method, it is possible to know the distribution of arc durations at any instance of time and, at the same time, the integration of arc durations has become much more convenient and less time consuming than any other existing methods. It has also been found that the total integrated-arc durations bear a linear relationship with the number of operations on a log-log scale."

"New methods for precise linear and nonlinear A/D, A/A, and D/A transformations, based on the principle of the dual-slope conversion are proposed. These methods enable multiplication, exponential and logarithmic conversion, determination of nth roots, and the solution of polynomial equations to be performed during the conversion cycle."
"This paper presents a novel application of open-ended microwave cavities for monitoring residual water content or bound water content in nonconductive fluids transported in circular pipes. The sensor consists of a section of a circular waveguide lined with a solid dielectric inserted in series with the piping system transporting the test fluid. At the selected frequency of operation, the end waveguides formed by the piping system operate below cutoff, while the sensor forms a resonant cavity. The resonant frequency of the cavity, which is a measure of the water content in the test fluid, is monitored automatically by an electronic system."
"A novel experimental technique is introduced and used to measure the effect of frequency multiplication on the RF spectrum of an oscillator. This technique makes it possible to produce the RF spectrum at X band-where measurements are relatively straightforward-that would have been produced by frequency multiplication of the 5-MHz source to any frequency from 9.2 GHz to 100 THz (1014 Hz). A simplified theory is developed and shown to reproduce the experimental results for the relative power in the carrier and noise pedestal, and the shape and the width of the carrier and noise pedestal, to within the measurement uncertainty of 2 or 3 dB, from 5 MHz to 10 THz. The calculations are easily made using analytical techniques from the measurement of the spectral density of phase fluctuations of the source, the effective input spectrum density and the bandwidth of the multiplier chain, and the frequency multiplication factor. It is shown that present 5-MHz-crystal-controlled oscillators are useful as a precision source to ~500 GHz. Suggestions for extending their range to ~100 THz are made."
"This paper describes the system for the instrumentation of kinematic analysis based on the use of the raster-scanned image source. The system is capable of tracking four objects in three dimensions which is realized by two television cameras and a minicomputer. The advantages of the system over the previous manual and semiautomatic methods are discussed and the organization and the performance is shown."
"Small offsets in frequency from a given reference can be generated in a single sideband mixer employing a PLL. It is shown that the output frequency stability depends linearly on the fractional shift of the offset frequency generated, and on the coherence of the VCO. For the typical digital phase-locked loop synthesizer techniques, employing a crystal-stabilized VCO at 5 MHz, a 500-Hz offset can be realized with a 1-s frequency stability no better than a few parts in 107. An improved design is described which employs a pair of analog multipliers as an instantaneous phase detector together with feedback in quadrature. In laboratory tests this design demonstrated one second frequency stability of better than 1 part in 1010 when synthesizing the frequency 4.9995776 MHz from a 5.0-MHz cesium reference."
"A new method for measuring the complex reflection coefficient in a measurement system with a slotted line and homodyne detector is presented. The measurement involves the investigation of the change of phase angle of wave voltage along the waveguide terminated with the element under test. The principle of measurement and X-band measurement system consisting of waveguide elements are described. The signal fed to the homodyne detector is subject to the rectangular phase modulation which facilitates the construction of the modulator and increases the accuracy of phase determination. The phase shifter used in the system includes a slotted line. The reduction of the influence of residual reflections on the phase shift determination is described. Even with standard waveguide elements the measuring accuracy of amplitude reflection coefficient is found to be approximately 10-3."
"A complete linear fiber-optic-signal transmission system with an upper frequency limit greater than 150 MHz is described. The transmitter accepts signals in the range of 1 to 15 mV and amplitude modulates an LED. The emitted light signal is carried via fiber optics to a receiver employing a silicon avalanche detector and an amplifier which increases the signal level to the hundreds of millivolts range. Sine-wave bandwidth is 30 kHz-120 MHz (voltage response down to 70 percent), and phase distortion is low, thus preserving pulseshapes. For a transmission path consisting of 15 m of low-cost fiber cable, the dynamic range is 30 dB with harmonic content 30 dB below signal."
"A new technique to linearize the temperature-frequency relationship of an astable multivibrator using one thermistor is proposed. The center frequency can be adjusted at any set frequency by an adjustable resistance. Furthermore, the oscillation frequency is not affected by the change of supply voltage."
"In this article a square-wave generator, which employs an operational amplifier and is easy in construction, is considered for converting temperature to frequency so that the advantages of digital measurement of any physical quantity are utilized. A new procedure is suggested for obtaining linearity over a wide range of temperature for a specified value of deviation. Theoretical deviation curves have been obtained to show that the new procedure gives a wide range of temperature."
"A noticeable source mismatch occurs in measurements of noise parameters of a linear two-port, since an admittance-transformer network between the source and the two-port must be inserted. A generalized analysis of the source mismatch effects on noise measurements, which considers the dependence of the noise performance of the two-port on the input admittance, is presented here. On this basis, two types of noise generators are considered and compared with each other."
"In this paper, the possibility of minimizing the total inductance of an N loop B sensor is considered by numerically determining the optimum spacing between the loops. This technique involves formulating a set of simultaneous nonlinear equations for the loop separations using the maxima-minima theory with constraints, and then solving these equations using a multidimensional Newton-Raphson algorithm. It is found, however, that the mutual inductance is not a strong function of the loop positions, which implies that the total loop inductance is relatively insensitive to these values."
"A digital circuit is presented which compares a signal frequency to be measured to a reference frequency and increases the accuracy of rapid measurements of the signal frequency. The error expansion technique used is explained and the circuit is described in detail so that it may be used directly by others. The ability of the circuit to perform the desired function was demonstrated experimentally and test results are presented."
"The passive detection of velocities of objects moving transverse to the optical viewing axis is discussed from the standpoint of the spatial Fourier transform of the image. A simple algorithm is developed which yields the velocity, as a function of time, of an object moving against a complicated background. This algorithm relies on monitoring magnitude and phase of two prominent spatial Fourier components. Measurement of the Fourier components is most simply accomplished with the direct electronic Fourier transform (DEFT) sensor. This device employs coupling between the image intensity, surface acoustic waves, and electron current in a CdS film to decompose the image into Fourier components. Experimental results show strong confirmation between theory and experiment. The paper concludes with a brief comparison of the DEFT implementation versus other systems in terms of speed, sensitivity, and cost."
"An understanding of the fundamental constraints which limit the performance of controlled oscillators has permitted the development of a VCO having exceptional performance. The output frequency is relatively independent of power supply and temperature and is proportional to the controlling voltage for at least four decades. The switching circuitry is operated in a nonsaturating mode which allows frequency operation to 5 MHz. The entire circuit is compatible with monolithic IC technology."
"It is shown that the average magnetic-field intensity normal to a circular area coaxial with a thin current-carrying circular loop is proportional to the average current around the loop. Thus the constant-current assumption often associated with the calibration of loop antennas is unnecessary. The result is generalized to provide a method of calculating the average magnetic-field intensity normal to a circular area in a plane parallel to that of an arbitrary shaped thin-wire conductor carrying arbitrary current."
"Attenuation characteristics of an InSb waveguide isolator at 94 GHz and 75 K are given experimentally and theoretically. The structure is a rod of InSb placed coaxially in a circular waveguide. Operation of the device depends on changes of both absorption and cutoff wavelength in the structure with direction of propagation of a circularly polarized signal. Over 20-dB isolation is measured with 3-dB forward loss."
"The search for a reliable encoding and decoding process for pulse-code modulation (PCM) data streams is discussed with application in both the serial and parallel mode employing standard IRIG wide-band (2.0 MHz at 120 in/s) longitudinal magnetic tape recorder/reproducer. Serial and parallel PCM data at 4.0 and 3.0 Mbit/s/track, respectively, may be handled by the Sangamo Electric Company instrumentation systems with PCM channels in both portable and laboratory configurations. Not only was a method identified to utilze the maximum bandwidth available in conjunction with acceptable data error rates, but definite advantages and disadvantages were verified for all the standard PCM formats."
"A major disadvantage associated with the use of microcomputers is the expense associated with obtaining an in-house programming capability. This paper describes a software system written in Basic for a time-shared computer which provides this capability."
"The power output of a pulsed microwave oscillator or amplifier is often measured by means of a calibrated crystal detector preceeded by a calibrated attenuator. If the attenuator and crystal are not matched, then an error arises which is analogous to attenuator \"mismatch\" error in linear circuits, although the circuit under consideration has a nonlinear power source. An upper limit for this error is calculated and error curves are presented as a function of crystal and attenuator mismatch."
"A new-type power mount is developed which is capable of measuring microwave or millimeter-wave power using a quartz-crystal thermal sensor as the power detector. The principle of this power mount and experimental results are given."
"Present tunnel diode (TD) pulse generators have distortions in the pulse baseline and topline due to feedthrough of the triggering signal. This paper presents a new technique for reducing the trigger-induced distortions. A directional coupler is used to couple the trigger signal to the TD."
"A resonant sonic system has been established as satisfactory for the detection of serious internal decay for both treated and untreated hardwood (eucalyptus) poles used for electricity distribution purposes [1]. This paper summarizes the results of an investigation of the Resotest method conducted in New Zealand on a variety of softwood poles used for electricity distribution and communications purposes and concludes that the method is also valid for softwoods."

  "A nondestructive microwave cavity approach for measuring complex permittivities of materials in sheet form is described. The resonant cavity is a section of a rectangular waveguide terminated by a thin rigid and large flange containing a small rectangular iris opening. The iris is placed in firm contact with one side of the dielectric sample while the other side is backed with a highly conducting plate. Variations of the cavity resonant frequency and Q-factor caused by the dielectric can be related to its complex permittivity through the consideration of equivalent admittance of this open-ended dielectricloaded aperture at resonance. Experimental determination of aperture admittance of a loaded iris is made and the results compared with theoretical calculations. The validity of this technique is confirmed by evaluating the resonant cavity characteristics by loading it with dielectrics of known permittivities and comparing the results with theoretical results. The permittivity of a lossy dielectric slab is measured and the value obtained by this method is compared with those found by other techniques. In all these cases the agreement between theory and measurements is satisfactory. Utility of this technique in evaluating the local inhomogeneities of permittivity of sheets is demonstrated. Measurement errors and limitations of this technique are pointed out."
"A description of a compact Rb87 maser approximately 20 cm in diameter and 30 cm in length is given and the features of the principal components are discussed. The fractional frequency fluctuations (Allan variance) are less than 5 × 10-13 for averaging times between 1 and 103 s. The effects of various parameters on the maser frequency are investigated experimentally and compared to theoretical predictions obtained from the maser frequency equation."
"Three modifications of time-division multipliers have been investigated with respect to their response to ac and dc input quantities. These investigations were part of the development of an electronic ac-dc power comparator and were carried out by aid of a computer (Siemens type 4004). The calculations take into account different values of power factors, sample rates, amplitudes and different signal phases with respect to the first sample pulse. Results are presented in form of graphs and tables."
"The electromagnetic shielding properties of enclosures, constructed of well-jointed metal sheets, depends primarily upon the permeability, resistivity, and thickness of these sheets. A nondestructive method of measuring the permeability and resistivity of these sheets is described. This method requires access to only a single surface of the metal to be tested and does not require preparation of samples or other cutting operations. The portable test equipment can be applied to the exterior surfaces of small enclosures or to the interior surfaces of large enclosures even if these latter are buried in the earth. Sets of electrical contacts are used to inject a unit-step pulse of current into the exposed surface of the sheet and the resulting surface voltage gradient between the contacts is measured. The permeability and resistivity of the metal determine the rate of diffusion of current into the surface and, therefore, the rate of decrease of this surface voltage gradient. At late times the current density will be uniform throughout the thickness of the sheet resulting in the surface voltage gradient stabilizing at a value depending on the resistivity and thickness of the metal."
"The Fraunhofer line discriminator Mark II (FLD-II) is an airborne photometric instrument for the remote measurement, on a precise and quantitative scale, of solar-stimulated luminescence. The luminescence may originate in such diverse sources as oil spills and chemical pollutants, the chlorophyll of normal or stressed vegetation, and fluorescent tracer dyes used to study current flow and dispersion in large bodies of water. Work now in progress by the U. S. Geological Survey expresses the concentrations of various fluorescent substances in terms of equivalent concentrations of the tracer dye, rhodamine WT, in water that the FLD-II can reliably measure down to levels of 0.1 part per billion (1 part in 1010). Detailed calculations show that this is within a factor of about 21/2 to 5 of theoretical, photon-limited performance. The instrument measures luminescence in a scene by quantitative distinction between reflected sunlight, which is \"coded\" by Fraunhofer absorption bands, and luminescence, which is not. Narrow-band optical filters provide in-band and out-of-band light samples from the scene and from pure sunlight to a photomultiplier tube. Digital conversion and computation render a reading of the fluorescence coefficient."
"The Walsh expansion of a periodic sinusoid is an infinite series; however, if one synthesizes a sinusoid from a truncated Walsh expansion, the result is a stepped approximation to the sinusoid that has minimum mean-square error. The first 2m nonzero terms in the Walsh expansion yield a wave that has 2m steps per quarter-cycle. A notable feature of this wave is the wide separation between its harmonic pairs. For example, eight nonzero Walsh terms yield a wave whose only nonzero harmonics are the 31st and 33rd, the 63rd and 65th, etc., harmonic magnitudes being inversely proportional to frequency. Waves of this type are readily synthesized using a synchronous Walsh array generator with true and complement outputs, a level converter system, and a summing circuit."
"An instrumentation scheme is presented which provides a calibrated field intensity equivalent plot using common laboratory equipment. The parameter that is measured gives a direct indication of the merit of an ultrasonic transducer for a given application in terms of its beam shape. The composite output of the system yields a three-dimensional representation of the intensity equivalent parameter as a function of a two-dimensional spatial field. Several applications of the resulting instrumentation are given including the effects of crystal window flatness and acoustic lensing."
"A circuit is described for the measurement of the temperature difference between input and output heat exchangers by means of resistance thermometers. Two thermometer resistors form part of a resistance-to-frequency converter, the frequency being proportional to their difference in resistance value. The frequency is also dependent on a few additional resistors and a capacitor. Drifts and offsets of amplifiers are eliminated to a first order. No stabilized voltages are used. The circuit was developed as part of a simple and reliable calorimeter for domestic uses."
 "Computer-operated transmission measuring sets and network analyzers have been used to measure the impedance of components used in modern communications systems. The component is interfaced to the test set using a suitable coupling network for the impedance level and frequency range. Optimized or adaptive coupling networks may be employed to extend the range and accuracy of impedance measurements by an order of magnitude compared to a single fixed-topology coupling network."
"The differential voltmeter described is based on the dc comparator, so that the voltage adjustment is made by varying turns and not by selecting taps on a resistive divider. The linearity errors are, therefore, permanently less than one least significant digit. One, ten, hundred, and thousand volt ranges with impedances of 1000 Ω/V are provided; also provided are high-impedance ranges of 1-10 V. Either positive or negative voltages may be measured. On all except the 10-V high-impedance range, there is a 60-percent overrange capability. The method of automatically converting the analog-input signal to a digital display, the main sources of error, and the techniques and components used to keep the error less than one least significant digit are discussed."
"An impedance bridge for high-voltage capacitance and related measurements to an accuracy of 1 ppm is described and the background research and development which made it possible is documented. The bridge is of the transformer-ratioarm type, the principal components of which are a comparator and several two-stage transformers. The bridge can be used to measure capacitance ratios over a range from 1/1 to 107/1 with a resolution between 0.1 and 0.25 ppm. The highest accuracies are obtained at the principal power frequencies of 50-60 Hz, but the bridge is usable up to 400 Hz. The factors which limited the accuracy of previously developed bridges of this type were reexamined and their influence reduced. Two independent methods were developed for the calibration of the bridge."
"For applications in the field of high-precision electrical measurements, specially on superconducting circuits, a dc-current source has been developed, which supplies two dc currents with selectable ratios in the range between 10 mA and 5 A. The performance of the instrument relies on the combination of conventional dc-current comparators with low ripple sampling detectors and ironless cryogenic current comparators with a SQUID as zero detector. Thus the current ratio is stabilized to 1 X 10-9 of its value."
"The advantages and disadvantages of one-step and multidecade inductive voltage dividers at low frequencies, i.e., frequencies below 10 Hz, are discussed. By electronically decreasing the magnetizing current of one-step dividers and by use of a special design, errors become very small. The construction and the calibration of such dividers is described. Preliminary test results of dividers of the autotransformer and the isolating transformer type show in-phase errors of 10-8 (ratio 10-2) and 10-7 (ratio 10-3) of output. Output resistances are in the 10-3 Ω range. The input resistances are about 109 Ω at 81/3 Hz."
"Logic state analyzers are used to monitor, or measure, the sequence of program and data flow in sequential processors, such as computers and microprocessors, as a means of debugging, testing, and troubleshooting these processors. The application of these measurements is discussed using examples of debugging and troubleshooting techniques made possible by logic state analyzers. The capabilities required to implement these measurements are set forth using the previously described measurements. These measurement capabilities, then, become the functional definition of a logic state analyzer. Finally, the block diagram required to implement these measurement capabilities is developed as a further means of describing the measurement of logic or data sequences and the application of these measurements to troubleshooting, debugging, and testing sequential digital machines and systems."
"A new electronic method for electric energy measurement is described. The suggested method makes possible the construction of watthour meters without directly employing an electronic multiplier. The method is based on the utilization of a V/F converter with an inverse F/V conversion in the feedback loop. The input voltage and current signals modulate the basic frequency in such a way as to produce, in a given time interval, a number of pulses proportional to the energy present during the interval. The principal advantage of the system is the significant component reduction, enabling the construction of domestic watthour meters compatible in cost with the Ferraris type solutions."
"The purpose of this paper is to present two methods of accumulating, analyzing, and presenting in real time the data generated by a Kerr system in response to a high-voltage impulse. These methods provide immediate information concerning selected electrical parameters in a form which is easily interpretable by most personnel. The first method uses an electronic counter to determine the number of optical transmittance maxima, i.e., light pulses, duritg the high-voltage impulse. From this count, the peak value of impulse can be calculated. The second method, which can be more accurate and does provide information concerning waveshape, uses a digital recorder to store the output waveform from the Kerr system. A computer is then used to reconstruct the voltage impulse and to determine such parameters as the peak value and risetime of the impulse."
"The electrodynamic exciter is widely used to perform vibration testing. Commonly, the exciter is energized with wide-band audio random noise. The spectral density of the random vibration is made to conform to a desired plot, through automatic servo techniques. The spectrum is split into contiguous filter bandwidths, with an individual control loop for each band. Thus, any specimen resonance is equalized. Dligital equalizers have recently been introduced. Their control dynamic range is liable to be curtailed by the number of significant figures possible in the digital computations. A method of improvement is described, whereby the roundoff effect is used as a dither signal. Some control schemes have been reported using the specimen transfer-function as the basis of control. These schemes are also analyzed here and the effect of roundoff error in limiting their function is explained. Finally, the technique proved effective for simple equalization is applied to the more sophisticated multiple-signal control situation, through the application of random-flight theory. The technique maintains equalizer performance equal to that of the single-acceleration case, with negligible increase in system complexity: a long-standing goal of vibration technology."
"This paper describes an automatic error plotting system for analog-to-digital converters (ADC's) which measures the static errors of the device under test at every quantization band edge (QBE) and displays them in graphical form. A quantization band edge is defined as any ADC input voltage which produces two adjacent output codes, each with 50-percent probability. The error of the ADC is then defined as the difference between the actual and nominal values of a QBE. A feedback loop which seeks each QBE is central to the system. Sample plots show the ability of the system to display common types of ADC errors and to display error signatures that often point to specific ADC problems. Resolution, accuracy, and (to a large extent) speed of the system depend on the digital voltmeter chosen as a standard. In a typical case, a 2000 point plot can be made in two minutes with a resolution and accuracy exceeding the weight of the ADC's least significant bit by an order of magnitude."
"A digital feedback circuit has been developed that integrates the current from a photomultiplier tube or other current source and delivers a digital output signal. The high conversion rate permits precise integration of the photocurrent resulting from chopped or pulsed-light sources. The processing lag of approximately 300 ns makes this a real-time system for most applications in that it delivers discrete pulse-by-pulse readouts for signals spaced at this or longer intervals. The measurement of pulse area represents optimum processing in photo-limited situations. The circuitry is based upon the delta-modulation encoder with the refinement that return-to-zero (RZ) pulses are used to eliminate nonlinearities due to contiguous-pulse effects. With the component values shown, the circuit area-encodes pulses of 7-μA peak amplitude with a maximum nonlinearity of about 0.1 percent of full scale. The feedback error of the circuit produces a random noise component that varies inversely with the square-root of pulse duration and is about 0.1 percent of full scale, peak-to-peak, for pulses of 10-ms duration."
"A system has been developed for ultra-high-speed digital recording and analysis of transient phenomena. It enables one to look back in time, recording signals that occur prior to single events which have statistical uncertainties of occurrence, such as lightning or breakdown phenomena. The system as installed is playing an essential role in studying \" cause-effect\" relationships through the acquisition and analysis of data. Data are received in an asynchronous fashion in real time and stored in a cartridge disk through Transient Recorders (Biomation Model 8100) and minicomputer (Melcom-70, Japan). The system is time-shared and digital-controlled by multiple users from remote consoles located at nine test stations. The stored data are retrieved and analyzed with highest \"time availability\" priority to get processed information through correlation, statistical analysis or various computer-aided simulations. Special precautions have been taken against high energy electromagnetic noise fields, such as grounding, shielding, etc., in order to attain noise-proof operation. Principles of operation, major components, and examples of the application of the system are presented."

"The stability of waveguide modes in a waveguide along which is propagated an unneutralized, intense beam of relativistic electrons guided by an applied axial magnetic field is considered. It is found that the waveguide mode can interact unstably with the beam by resonating with the Doppler shifted cyclotron frequency of the beam. This instability appears to be the mechanism by which microwaves are produced in some recent experiments which are discussed."
"Initial empirical results are presented for the hot-ion plasma heating experiments conducted in the new SUMMA (Superconducting Magnetic Mirror Apparatus) at NASA Lewis Research Center. A discharge was formed by applying a radially inward DC electric field near the mirror throats. Data were obtained at midplane magnetic flux densities from 1.0 to 3.5 tesla. Charge-exchange neutral particle energy analyzer data were reduced to ion temperatures using a plasma model that included a Maxwellian energy distribution super-imposed on an azimuthal drift, finite ion orbits, and radial variations in density and electric field. Using this plasma model, the highest ion temperatures computed were 5 keV, 1.2 keV, and 1 keV for He+, H2+, and H+, respectively. These were obtained at a mid-plane magnetic flux density of 1.6 T. Ion temperature was found to scale roughly as (P/B)n, where P/B is the ratio of power input to magnetic flux density and n is about 1 for hydrogen and 2 for helium. Optical spectroscopy line-broadening measurements yielded ion temperatures about 15 percent higher than the charge-exchange neutral particle analyzer results for hydrogen and about 50 percent higher for helium. Spectroscopically obtained electron temperatures ranged from 3 to 30 eV."
"A simple, model-independent description of the compression experiment of Ito's group at Osaka University predicts the observed plasma heating and final plasma ß to within a factor of two."
"The study of drifting plasma in the laboratory or the ionsphere is not a straightforward problem because of the many variables such plasma will encounter. The presence of negative ions will add to the complication due to the detachment mechanism and other physical processes. It is not easy to separate the negative ion current component from the electron current component. To study negative ion population and mass spectra in the lower ion-sphere the value of the mean free path λ and the Debye shielding radius λo of the medium should be taken into consideration together with the collision frequency of the different charged particles. Cylindrical Langmuir probes have been used successfully as dianostic techniques for the drifting plasma. A cylindrical probe of suitable radius in relation to λ and λo was chosen. The probe was swept by a composite wave-form which contained a sawtooth sweep and two audio -frequency signals. The experiment was flown on board a stabilised rocket \"Centaure\" at high latitudes at Norway. The outputs yielded information about : 1. The first derivative of the current i with respect to the applied probe voltage -V 2. Percent modulation from which d2 i/dv2 was obtained. The second derivative is a function of the energy distribution function of the charged particles. The negative ion Gaussian peaks of energy are easily detached on the energy distribution function graph from those of thermal electrons."
"In this scheme the plasma escaping from a mirror machine is split into an array of long narrow beams by means of a grid of iron slabs. For proper shaping of the slabs, the increased mirror ratio at the iron causes acceptably low beam interception. After spherical expansion of the magnetic field containing the escaping plasma, the electrons are repelled by non-intercepting grids. A spatially alternating electric and/or magnetic field which follows is converted to an alternating or rotating force by the motion of the ions. At sufficiently low velocity, this force resonates with the cyclotron frequency and sweeps the ions to collector plates. With average ion energies of 293 keV an efficiency of 85% can be obtained in a system whose size is much smaller than other proposed direct conversion systems. For a 74% efficienicy, only 186 keV ions are required and the system becomes extraordinarily compact."

"The equilibrium distribution for free electrons in a real gas is derived based on the existence of an interaction potential between a free electron and its nearest neighbor atom (or ion). The form of the interaction potential is inversely proportional to rl where l is a constant; and the derived distribution reduces to the Maxwellian form when the interaction is neglected. It is shown that for most physical situations this interaction potential will only contribute a miniscule change to those electron properties which are dependent upon<|vj|>, j>-3 where <|v|> is the electron speed."
"An orientable secondary emission detector is described. Its response to the fast neutral atom flux emitted by a plasma allows to measure the density profile, the phase space distribtuion function and the average energy of the plasma ions."
"We calculate transmission and reflection coefficients for an ion acoustic wave incident from the upstream direction upon a plasma discontinuity of width much less than the wavelength. In the limit of an infinitely strong discontinuity there is complete in phase reflection."
"The sparking potentials and swarm coefficients (ionization and attachment coefficients) have been measured in sulphurhexafluoride- air and freon-nitrogen mixtures over the range of 110 ≤ E/p ≤ 240 V cm-1 torr-l and gas pressures varying between 1 and 20 torr, at 20°C. Addition of strongly attaching salphur-hexafluoride and freon gases increased the sparking potentials and the rate of increase of the attachment coefficient with increasing percentage of the strongly attaching gases in the mixtures was much larger than the rate of change of the first ionization coefficient."
"A new HF device is described. It allows the production, without the use of a magnetic field, of long plasma columns from a small HF coupling structure situated at one end of the column. Its operation is based on the propagation of a cold plasma surface wave. This device can work (in argon for example) at pressures from 2 mTorr to 20 Torr with electron densities from 1010 cm-3 to 1013 cm-3, depending on plasma diameter and HF power. Typically, 80W of 500 MHz HF will produce a 25 mn diameter column of 1.8 m length. The plasma is quiescent (low electron density fluctuations), efficient (~ 100% absorbed power), and perfectly reproducible. It can be used as a substitute for a positive column, and some practical applications are foreseen in ion production, laser excitation, gas preionization and spectroscopic sources."
 "The dielectric tensor for a multi-component, homogeneous, field-free relativistic plasma is derived in manifestly covariant form. From the dielectric tensor, linear dispersion relations are obtained explicitly when each component of the plasma is isotropic in its rest frame. If the components are relativistic Maxwellians, these dispersion relations are expressible in terms of the relativistic plasma dispersion function. Special attention is given to the Weible and two-stream instabilities and to the normal modes of a quiescent, hot electron gas. For the last case the dispersion relations are solved numerically and compared against computer simulation data. An appendix applies the formalism to cold plasmas."
"By retaining higher order terms in analysis, a more accurate expression for the reflection and transmission coefficients of an extraordinary wave propagating perpendicular to a static magnetic field through an infinite warm plasma is obtained. The result is compared with previous analytical and numerical results, the latter obtained by an integral equation method. In addition to occurring at resonances, the total reflection of the extraordinary wave is shown to also occur at anti-resonances with a standing wave of larger amplitude."
"A more accurate analytical expression for the reflection and transmission coefficients of an extraordinary wave incident upon a thin finite plasma slab perpendicular to a static magnetic field is obtained. The analytical result is compared with that obtained by the numerical method and with that of earlier experimental observations. The effect of small collisional damping on mode conversion, particularly at antiresonance is also discussed."
"An apparatus is described which is used for the controlled production, characterization, and study of dissociated gases in a microwave discharge at elevated temperatures. A unique feature is the ability to produce and study a microwave discharge plasma in the heated zone. This allows elevated temperature reactions to be studied in high concentrations of dissociated gases. Further, the system permits weight change measurements of specimens in the plasma, thus facilitating reaction rate determinations. Included is a description of a cavity for use on a 50-mm diameter cylindrical reactor. The effects of flow rate, pressure, temperature, power, metal sample, and sampling position on dissociation percentage of oxygen in the apparatus are described as well as a technique for sample temperature measurements in the plasma which permits determination of high temperature recombination coefficients and reaction rates."
"The one dimensional nonlinear hydrodynamic equations describing longitudinal cold plasma oscillations are studied by the classical Lagrangian-Euler method. A new method to invert the solutions from Lagrangian to Euler description is introduced. It is also shown in this paper that this method is capable of yielding results identical to those from KBM perturbation to second order of approximation. The new method, however, produces higher order approximations much more rapidly."

"A new diagnostic method based on the excitation of thermal resonances using an electroacoustic probe has been developed to determine the electron density profile and other plasma parameters of a cylindrical warm-plasma column. A coaxial electroacoustic probe is used to excite and detect the dipole and thermal resonances as the plasma density is varied. The electron density profile is expressed functionally in terms of unknown profile parameters. The profile and other parameters of the plasma column are then determined numerically based on some theoretical formulas and experimental results."
"This study is concerned with the problem of electromagnetic wave propagation in a magneto-plasma filled coaxial structure. The problem is formulated using the classical boundary value problem approach. Based on this formulation an extensive numerical investigation is performed. The numerical investigation shows the existence of propagating slow modes, backward modes, a quasi-TEM mode, and waveguide-type modes in a magneto-plasma filled coaxial structure. Dispersion curves for these different modes are presented. The dependence of the different modes on various plasma parameters is considered."
"Measurements have been made of electromagnetic propagation in a coaxial electrode structure filled with longitudinally magnetized plasma. The annular plasma region had a 9.55 cm outer diameter, a 3.82 cm inner diameter and was approximately 60 cm long. A magnetic field of 300 gauss was employed. Electromagnetic wave frequencies were in the range .5 to 2.4 GHz. The plasma was generated by a continuous glow discharge. The resulting ω vs. ß curves closely follow the predicted curves for the \"quasi-TEM\" mode. On the basis of this model, plasma frequencies were 40 - 80% of the cyclotron frequency, depending on magnitude of the glow discharge current."
"Classical coupling, i. e. net absorption by inverse bremsstrahlung, of laser radiation in thin layers of dense (n >> nc) plasmas is described by Eqs. (19) and (26) according to a wave description of the radiation field and a simple hydrodynamic model of the plasma and by Eqs. (29) and (47) according to a photon transport model. Though it appears that neither of these descriptions can be explored further without computer assistance, their implications seem to be quite discrepant. Equation (28) implies that the Maxwell-hydrodynamic model leads to high reflectivity of thin, dense plasma layers. Equation (47), on the other hand, implies - because of the smallness of Γ ~ υei/w ~10-3 - 10-2 - that any plasma layer is extremely absorptive in the density region for which n ~ nc. Though this discrepancy is, so far, based only upon qualitative arguments, it nevertheless appears real."
"The stability of electromagnetic ion cyclotron harmonic waves propagating normal to an external magnetic field is studied for plasmas whose ions possess loss cone type velocity distributions. It is found that, if the ions are stationary, no instability develops except in the extreme case when the ratio of parallel to perpendicular \"temperatures\" of the ions is of the order mi/me, where mi and me are the ion and electron masses respectively. However, for the case of two counterstreaming ion beams in a neutralizing background of electrons, instability at zero frequency and near the first several ion cyclotron harmonics can occur if the streaming velocity is of the order of the electron thermal speed."
"An original study of wire oscillation in the ionizer unit of an electrostatic precipitator was made. The ionizer unit was modeled into a theoretical block diagram system, from which stability criteria were derived. Experimental measurements of the system parameters were devised. A comparison of an experimental single wire, double plate model and the theoretical system model resulted in close agreement."
"Townsend's first ionization coefficients have been measured in corssed electric and magnetic fields for values of B/p ranging from 0.013 TESLA. TORR-1 to 0.064 TESLA.TORR-1 and for 103 x 102≤ E/p≤ 331 x 102 V.M-1. TORR-1 in oxygen and for 122 x 102≤ E/p≤488 x 102 V.M-1.TORR-1 for dry air. The values of effective collision frequencies determined from the equivalent pressure (pe) concept generally increase with E/p at constant B/p and decrease with increasing B/p at constant E/p. Effective collision frequencies determined from measured sparking potentials at high values of E/p increase with decreasing E/pe. The drift velocity and mean energy of electrons in oxygen in crossed electric and magnetic fields have been derived."
"The possibility of stabilizing effects that an rf electric field imposes on drift instabilities in an inhomogeneous plasma is investigated. A two-species, nonisothermal plasma, situated in an externally applied static magnetic field is considered with the rf electric field applied in the same direction as the dc magnetic field. The plasma is \"mildly\" inhomogeneous in density, with a density gradient perpendicular to the confining magnetic field. Using a hydrodynamic model for the plasma it is found that under certain conditions an increase in the frequency of the drift oscillations is obtained as the result of the application of the rf electric field. The increase in the frequency of the drift oscillations results in an increase in the magnitude of the stabilizing term associated with Landau damping which in turn yields a smaller growth rate for the drift instability. Discussions of the state of the plasma for different values of the frequency of the applied electric field are presented and the feasible ranges of values of the above quantity required for stabilization are determined. It is concluded that the resulting stabilization is significant only in a very narrow rf band. Therefore, the application of this technique appears to be a difficult experimental undertaking."
 "The concept of transfer function which is so valuable for lumped dynamical systems is developed for plasma problems. Methods of construction of transfer functions for problems with boundary excitation as well as internal excitation are discussed."
"By using the perturbation technique, a Kortewege-de-Vries (K-dV) equation for a multicomponent plasma with negative ions and isothermal electrons has been derived. We have discussed the stationary solutions of K-dV equation and it has shown that in the presece of multiple ions, the amplitude of solitons exhibits interesting behaviour, especiallY when the negative ions are present."
"The axial distributions of the electron temperature and number density of a free-burning atmospheric argon arc plasma at 15 Amps have been measured using a Thomson scattering technique. In addition, the excitation temperature of singly ionized argon has been found spectroscopically by relative line intensity method. The results are presented in terms of the degree of electron temperature nonequilibrium as compared with the calculated Saha equilibrium temperature and with the measured ionic excitation temperature along the axis of the arc. The observed temperatures are discussed with respect to the theoretical ion-like particle temperature and to the effect of electrode geometry."
"Experiments were performed on an electron cyclotron resonance plasma in a dc magnetic mirror to determine the effects of lower hybrid resonance radiation on the anisotropy of the plasma. It was found that the anisotropy of the plasma hot electrons decreased, the flux of hot electrons escaping through the mirror throats decreased and the midplane wall bremsstrahlung rate slightly increased as lower hybrid resonance power was increased. This is explained by observing that cold plasma, expelled by the lower hybrid radiation, decreases the number of scattering centers in the midplane, which results in a deeper diamagnetic well for the hot electrons."

"The Landau problem in relativistic plasma is considered in detail. It is shown how all modes in the plasma arise through proper treatment of the inverse Laplace transforms without imposition of any external conditions. A correct derivation of the asymptotic behavior of the electric field is included and estimates of the contribution of more rapidly decaying Landau modes are made analytically and are compared with numerical computations."
"The performance of a feedback controlled electrostatic energy analyzer has been investigated for use as the basic detection mechanism in an ion beam probe plasma diagnostic system. This system provides the only direct, spatially resolved measurement of plasma space potential. The principles involved in analyzer operation are presented, leading to an analyzer system with a design entrance angle of 33°. The voltage correction function which results when the probing beam is swept across the plasma has been measured experimentally and is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. The measured amplitude and phase response of the system show that the entire analyzer/detector system may be modeled as a linear feedback system. Finally, a dual beam technique is described for making absolute space potential measuremermts and is substantiated with experimental data from an arc plasma using a Rb-K combination."
 "The ratio of diffusion coefficient to mobility (D/μ) for electrons has been measured in SF6-air and freon-nitrogen mixtures for various concentrations of SF6 and freon in the mixtures over the range 140≤ E/p≤ 220 V.cm-1 - torr-1. In SF6-air mixtures, the values of D/≤ were always observed to lie intermediate between the values for the pure gases. However, in freon-nitrogen mixtures, with a small concentration (10 percent) of freon in the mixture, the values of D/≤ are found to lie above the boundaries determined by the pure gases. In this mixture, over the lower E/p range (140 to 190) the electrons appear to lose a large fraction of their energy by the excitation of the complex freon molecules, while at higher E/p values (200 to 240), the excitation and consequent deexcitation of nitrogen molecules and its metastables seem to cause an increased rate of ionization of freon molecules."
"Fusion research experiments require high energy short duration pulses. A homopolar machine, as an inertial energy storage system, offers an attractive source of energy meeting these requirements. The Energy Storage Group at The University of Texas at Austin has investigated the fundamental limitations to the discharge time of homopolar machines of various topological configurations. This paper presents a mathematical model for fast discharge homopolar machines. Based on this model, various machine configurations are analyzed. A new configuration - the spool type machine - is also discussed, criteria for the evaluation of different alternatives are presented, and it is concluded that highly efficient (≅ 95%), high energy (≅ gigajoules), fast-discharge (≅ 5 to 30 milliseconds) homopolar inertial energy storage systems are technically feasible. Brief reference is also made to some of the experimental results obtained from the existing laboratory models."
"Intense relativistic electron beams have been injected into the plasma of a Z pinch at various times during the formation of the plasma column. If the diameter of the plasma column exceeded a certain value, these beams were found to propagate with a high transport efficiency when injected either into the collapsing current sheet of the Z pinch or into the expanding plasma column after its diameter had reached a minimum. However, when the diameter of the plasma column is smaller than this critical value, the relativistic electron beam does not propagate. Instead, it continues to diverge until it strikes the glass wall of the Z pinch tube."
"Zinc ion pulses with varying amplitudes up to 1 mA have been extracted from a vacuum discharge. Repetitive operation of the pulsed discharge at 5300 Hz was maintained for 24 min. Breakdown of the 0.4 mm vacuum gap was accomplished by ramp-charging a 270 pF capacitor connected across the gap until breakdown occurred, the capacitor then being discharged through the gap. Stable operation was maintained by feedback control of the electrode spacing. The anode was eroded at 10 mg/C by the discharge, with 65 percent of the anode material being deposited on the cathode in the form of a fiber."

 "This paper discusses the career of one woman in the world of engineering as a way of pointing out the problems that women encounter in engineering. The problems include hiring, salaries, promotion, management, travel, and attitudes of coworkers. The paper includes suggestions for engineering professors to help prepare women students for engineering."
"Biomedical Engineering (BME), the application of engineering concepts and technology to living systems, is expected to experience explosive growth in the next decade. The effective introduction of technology, by well trained engineers, will alter the practice of medicine and made access to the health care system viable for all 220,000,000 United States residents. The activities of the biomedical research engineer employed by the university and the development engineer employed by biomedical industry are discussed. In addition, the duties of the clinical engineer employed in a hospital and who deals with problems relating to patient care is presented. Three curricular approaches to preparing for the biomedical profession, \" classical,\" \"interdisciplinary,\" and \" new discipline,\" are outlined. Factors which make BME a desirable occupation for women are emphasized."
"The thesis of this paper is that the junior high school years are a key time in the development of orientation towards careers. It is suggested that since women are so grossly underrepresented in the engineering profession, efforts to attack the problem should include work with students at this period in their lives. A team-taught discussion of engineering as an interesting and vital career for women and men, accompanied by a dynamic demonstration of applied scientific principles, has been offered by Georgia Institute of Technology to two school systems in the Metropolitan Atlanta area. Three programs-Lasers and Holograms (Electrical Engineering), Polymer Chemistry (Textile Engineering), and High Temperature and High Temperature Materials (Ceramic Engineering) have been developed by faculty in the respective schools and are described in this paper. Reception has been enthusiastic and the suggestion is made that such programs can act as catalysts to produce longer range programs which can help move us toward parity for women in the engineering profession."
"Engineers can play a special role in society. Working in industry, the corporation's sphere of influence can act as a lever for a contributing professional individual. Hence, the engineer is able to exert a greater force on the world than most other people. With technology carrying us away at a rapid (and some think devastating) rate, the need for socially responsible professional people is becoming more crucial. Many believe that members of minority groups can make an effective contribution to the modern social engineering concerns that confront us. There are several programs currently underway by colleges, government, and industries to increase the flow of minorities into the engineering profession. This article discusses two programs whose purpose is to promote an interest for engineering and science in youngsters. First, the Science Consultant Program-sponsored by Xerox Corporation. The SCP is a volunteer program that gives elementary school students a first-hand look at science by bringing scientists, technicians, and engineers to the inner-city classrooms. Second, the Junior Engineering Technical Society which works through school sponsored clubs and projects to provide engineering oriented career guidance to high school students."
"Information about women in technical majors is almost non-existent. That fact plus the need for more data motivated this research. The sample was all women who entered the University of Minnesota's Institute of Technology between 1961 and 1970. A male comparison sample with academic ability/achievement levels equivalent to those of the women was also selected. Data gathered included pre-entrance interest, ability, and personality measures; persistence records in I.T.; and the responses to a questionnaire returned by 70% of all subjects. The data analyses in Phase One showed the women to be a high ability group with higher achievement in mathematics and the sciences than in English and social studies. In comparison to the men, their interests are broader and more likely to stem from childhood. The women were also more likely to make career decisions earlier than the men. Both the men and women agreed that the stereotype of a coed in a technical major is a negative one. Phase Two of the analyses revealed that 30% of the women compared to 50% of the men persisted. A factor in the women's higher withdrawal rate is the perceived inflexibility of the curriculum in relationship to their broader interests. Phase Three focused on women in engineering. Most of the findings about all women also applied to women in engineering. The questionnaire data, however, showed some unique characteristics for this group."
"As the number of women becomes a significant component of the student body in engineering schools, engineering educators will have to consider ways and means to provide these students with the best possible training, both in technical areas and in professionalism. Based on personal experiences as a student and a professor of electrical engineering, a range of issues relevant to the educational process of women engineers is discussed:feelings of isolation; feelings of minority status; added pressures on women engineering students; problems with self-image, self-confidence; lower aspiration levels; problems associated with not being \"taken seriously\"; feelings of insecurity arising from inexperience with manual skills; the importance of role models; educational relations which become sexualized; special problems arising in the research environment. Examples of these phenomena are given and an attempt is made to offer some helpful, pragmatic suggestions."
"A decade ago the general public had a very nebulous concept of an engineer. It ranged from one who drove a train to one who collected garbage-a sanitation engineer. Those who were more knowledgeable about engineers still looked upon them as people doing a highly specialized job but who had little other talent. Although engineering has gained prestige and made fantastic contributions to technology during the last decade, there still exist some very great inequities. One of the most significant of these is engineering education as it relates to the black female and to other minority groups studying both for an undergraduate and a graduate degree in some field of engineering."
"For years engineering has been predominantly a masculine profession, and for the first 46 years of its existence, General Motors Institute remained an all male educational institution. In 1965 the first female co-op student entered GMI, and since then, the co-ed population has increased rapidly. My paper outlines the co-op program, with emphasis on the female students and their feelings and experiences regarding the GMI program. I have also included some of my own experiences as the first woman to teach in the field of engineering at GMI."
"Special programs which lead high school girls to the college registration lines for freshmen engineering students are very new to most universities. Women enrollments of up to 10% of the engineering student body is equally a new experience. The College of Engineering at the University of North Dakota has conducted summer programs for high school girls for the last four years. The effort to attract, retain, and graduate women engineers seems to be successfully established. Thirty percent of the participants in the summer programs have enrolled in engineering at UND and 85% of those are continuing their study. Fifty percent of the total female engineering students are institute participants; the other 50% enrolled directly into the college or transferred from other disciplines and other schools. Regardless of their origin, women engineering students are talented and well prepared as their average composite ACT score of about 27 indicates. The special effort by staff and students has increased the enrollment of women in engineering by a factor of 10 since 1971."
"Activities by universities to attract more women and enrollments of women in engineering schools have both increased dramatically in the last two years. Survey responses from 70 institutions show that less than half have a staff member with specific responsibility to work toward increasing the enrollment of women. However, most institutions indicated that they were making efforts to attract more women students. Recruiting activities include the development and use of printed materials and other promotional materials; scholarship programs; academic year conferences; summer programs; and high school visits. Not all universities felt that retention of women students was a problem, but many did have activities which tended to increase the chances that women students would complete their degrees in engineering. Such efforts include providing social support, offering special advising, giving recognition for achievement, providing role models, offering opportunity for involvement, helping women gain job experience, and making financial aid available to part-time students. Lack of commitment, funding, staff time, and know-how are offered as possible factors responsible for the somewhat limited scope of present recruiting activities. An approach to setting up planned, comprehensive programs for women is offered."
"The participation of women as students and as faculty members in the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign is examined in this paper. The enrollment of undergraduate women in engineering and the awarding of engineering degrees to them is compared with nationwide averages. Recent efforts undertaken by the University of Illinois to attract more women into the engineering curriculum are discussed next, including the sponsorship of a two-day conference for high school girls to introduce them to engineering and the publication of an award winning guidance brochure. Finally, the low frequency of women on the teaching faculty in engineering departments is considered, and the potential effects of current affirmative action in the tight academic marketplace are evaluated."
"Women have been in engineering at Stanford since 1928. Ever increasing numbers of females are now entering the undergraduate programs. Females comprise 18% of the freshman engineers. Much smaller percentages are evident on the graduate level. Stanford's course of action in attracting females into engineering on both levels is outlined."
"The recruitment of women for appointment to engineering faculties is best described as a search for members of a class of professionals which are in extremely short supply. After discussing the current, low representation of women on engineering faculties (and in the profession), projections are made for the future and suggestions are presented to increase the number of women beyond that projected."
"This paper addresses the topic of women who are now engineering educators. It examines their progression through the academic ranks, their status, and the outlook for the immediate future, both in terms of their regular academic duties and their prospects for university administration. Strategies for affirmative action in connection with promotion, retention, and tenure are suggested and justified, as are related strategies for motivating some faculty women engineers to administrative positions. It is concluded that women have the necessary potential and that substantive changes in traditional faculty and administrative attitudes will be needed to implement such change."

"In the fall of 1969 a systematic reorganization of the EE laboratory program was begun at Purdue University. The reorganization was approached using an educational system model which recognized the needs for: clear statements of instructional objectives, mechanisms for information transfer, opportunities to practice, and apply new skills, the personal dimension of education and evaluation procedures. A second educational model, essentially orthogonal to the one above, based on Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives was used to plan the degree to which various skills and activities should be stressed in each course. The educational methodologies used in developing the program and the end product of this effort are described."
"When a proposal was made to upgrade our two year operation to a four year departmentalized engineering school, certain academic areas were set up as a separate inter-departmental jurisdiction. One objective was to research better ways of designing and operating teaching laboratories-considered as one single dynamic system. Academically this led to (1) \"open\" laboratory operation, (2) students planning \"lab programs\" ahead of the lab day, and (3) lab tutors associated with a group of students throughout a set of laboratories, and not tied to one field. Economically it led to a single serviced work space, with mobile, quick-connect equipment that normally lives in an adjacent unserviced area."
"The development, methodologies, and first semester implementation of a senior level digital computer laboratory course are discussed. The laboratory centers around the use of a minicomputer and permits dedicated minicomputer usage for real time on-line processing or time sharing as necessary. The experiments emphasize the areas of control and communications. Unique aspects of this course include its development as performed mainly by graduate students (directed by the authors), the nature of the experiments themselves, the relatively large amount of credit it is assigned, the fundamental place it occupies in the Systems and Computer Engineering Curriculum, and its rapid and positive acceptance by students. Future plans for additions to existing experiments, new experiments, modifications in operating systems format, and innovative teaching methods are also described."
"Use of computers in engineering education for interactive design of electrical machinery provides a very attractive media to prepare engineering students for their professional lives. A computer system, named ESPACE, which supplies them with great flexibility of use, precise error detection, and a high level of interaction is described in this paper. Its realization is based upon the notion of a \"potential model,\" which is a set of possible components, their relations in a model and the basic actions existing within a design field. When working on this system, the students can design their own technical projects and simulate them to check if they operate properly. This turns out to be possible because the potential model can generate all their particular representations in the computer memory. This CAI system has been working for two years in the Electrical Engineering Department of the Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble. This paper gives some results obtained from this experience."
"Graduate teaching assistants and young university faculty because of their lack of teaching experience, often have difficulty in providing a good classroom experience for their students. This paper discusses several characteristics of the engineering learning environment, and attempts to clarify their relationships to effective teaching, which has been defined as scoring well on student evaluaiions. The development is cursory, but indicates several more detailed discussions for the interested reader."
"System functions for a linear system formed with lumped and distributed components can involve transcendental functions. Inversion from the Laplace domain to the time domain usually requires direct residue evaluation of the inversion integral. An algorithm for the evaluation of the residue involving a system function containing multiple order poles is given. The method is well suited for use on a digital computer since it does not require the use of differential calculus. It contains, as a side benefit, a means of expanding rational functions into their partial fraction form. Examples are given showing its application to residue calculations and partial fraction expansions."
"The transition from impedances in networks, where there are always two terminals present, to the field impedance at a single point in a medium demands a certain degree of maturity for full understanding. An intermediate step in the transition is considered by defining the impedance at a single point on a conductor in network terms. The introduction of this new impedance is applied to the operation of loaded wire antennas and results in greater ease of analysis and a readier understanding of the effect of changes in the antenna dimensions and loading."
"A new five year program in electrical engineering and management is described. This unique undergraduate program provides the student with a firm foundation in both engineering science and management studies. Its graduates are eligible for registration as professional engineers after engineering experience as well as qualified to write the Chartered Accountants' examination after an articling period. Every indication is that these graduates will be successful as both engineers and managers."
"An upper level undergraduate survey course in optical engineering is described. The goal of this course is to provide students with a working knowledge of optics and optical systems as applied to modern engineering problems."
"An open-shop intermediate electrical engineering laboratory in six basic areas of experimentation is described. The lab is well suited for schools with few faculty and technicians and with small classes. Approximately $28,000 is required to set up the complete lab, but practically no maintenance or updating is needed. Freedom of choice for the students is stressed."

"The Israeli engineering educational system, though essentially based on European and American traditions, is influenced by the country's geographical, ethnic, political, and economic conditions. Besides the well-established Technion, the newer Tel-Aviv University and Ben-Gurion University are also offering degree programs in electrical engineering. The article discusses both academic and non-academic programs, including continuing education for engineers, and describes some characteristics of the Israeli EE student and the professional environment of faculty."
"The evaluation of instructors by students through some sort of anonymous questionnaire is a procedure that has become established at many Universities. This produces numerical data that are used to classify the relative teaching effectiveness of instructors. Such instructor ratings have been collected over a four year period in the Electrical Engineering Department at the University of Waterloo, Canada. These data were analyzed statistically to investigate the possible effects of factors other than classroom performance; such as, teaching a subject for the first time, teaching service courses in other departments, subject matter, level of research support, admission year of the class, and class size. The majority of instructors were indistinquishable, although a few others were consistently different from this majority. Some observations are made, from this experience, regarding the significance of questionnaire ratings, their use in the University system, and the improvement of the quality of teaching."
"There has been growing interest in the interactions between law and technology as subject matter having potential utility for understanding modern society and for helping to resolve some of its difficulties. There has also been increasing interest in various \"mastery\" strategies as effective ways to organize and conduct courses. This paper describes a course in law and technology taught using selected features of mastery strategies modified to the unique needs of an interdisciplinary course and a very limited number of proctors."
"This paper reports on a pedagogic project on the use of the computer to aid in the teaching of communication engineering. The computer is integrated into the educational activities in several courses on different levels. The aim is to investigate the effect on the pedagogic process and to study how the computer could be most profitably used. An account is given of various computer activities with examples from courses on both the undergraduate and graduate levels. The project is evaluated from both an educational and an economical point of view."
"This paper describes an undergraduate electronic systems laboratory which has been developed during the past year within the School of Electrical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The objective of this laboratory is to provide the student with the opportunity to demonstrate tangibly in the laboratory the operation and interaction of discrete devices, integrated circuits, and electronic systems which he has studied or will study in the classroom. In this laboratory students perform experimentation on (a) the characteristics and applications of two basic linear ICs, the operational amplifier and anlog multiplier; (b) the operation of a successive-approximation type A/D converter and of a D/A converter; and (c) the synergistic operation of a A/D converter, D/A converter, and an operational amplifier along with other devices and subsystems to achieve a total system function. Relatively inexpensive test equipment is used which has proven quite reliable and easy to operate. Special purpose electronic system program (ESP) boards were specifically designed, constructed, and utilized to accomodate the approximately 200 students who yearly enroll in this laboratory. This paper describes the philosophy behind this electronic systems laboratory, discusses the test equipment and ESP boards utilized, and details the specific experiments performed."
"The increasing applications of minicomputers as components of engineering systems require the introduction of suitable courses into engineering curricula to allow students to incorporate computers in their designs in a knowledgeable manner. This paper describes a course which has been developed with this goal, and its developmental modifications which have occurred over the past several years. The course involves both lecture and laboratory work, organized to emphasize the properties of computer operation that must be understood to allow useful computer-augmented systems to be designed. It is felt that this description may be helpful for departments that are planning or developing similar courses."
"Two main variables, student personality and environmental motivation, were measured and controlled for 43 second year engineering students, in a four week segment of an introductory course in Strength of Materials. The students were assigned to three classes to which three motivational modes were applied. Mental ability was randomized across the three classes. The personality variable was defined according to Harvey's four belief systems, which ranged from concrete system (1) to abstract system (4). Two motivational modes were defined, external (EM) internal (IM) motivation, which were applied in conjunction with programmed instructions (PI) material specially prepared for this study. The results of the study indicated that the more abstract students (system 4) responded significantly to the type of motivational environment employed, and that utilization of the IM mode for the benefit of abstract individuals is beneficial to other students as well, but to a nonsignificant extent. When both abstract and concrete personality characteristics are about equal in a student, the concrete component is dominant in determining his academic behavior. The existence of individuals with such combined personalities may suggest a potentially greater proportion of abstract individuals in the general population than is proposed by Harvey. Marks in this study provided more effective motivation than money. The measurement of belief systems may provide a means of identifying students with a low probability of success in engineering."
"Starting from a specific requirement, and logically deriving the circuits that meet it, is a method of teaching electronic circuits that is likely to be of interest to both teacher and student. As an illustration of the sugested procedure, electronic DC voltage regulator circuits are derived here."
"A cooperative university-industry approach to satisfying continuing education needs for engineers is presented. The effort involves the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Maine at Orono, and Fairchild Semiconductor, South Portland, Maine. The program which results is a solution to a troublesome geographical problem since the industry is separated from the center of science and engineering education for the state by some 150 miles. This program includes courses offered in-house at Fairchild via a closed-circuit television-talkback system, a commuting professor and Fairchild engineers who have qualified for admission to the graduate faculty. A unique semester-on-campus grants the student-engineer a paid industrial sabbatical. Degree candidates culminate their M.S.E.E. program with a work-related thesis. However, the in-house courses, which are specifically designed to meet the joint requirements of the student and the industry, are open to all engineers, whether degree candidates or not."
"A teaching method is presented which has been used successfully in both undergraduate and graduate courses. It is based on using printed class notes as programmed learning material. The material is used in class with the instructor taking the role of a teaching machine. Courses taught using the method are listed and further applications suggested. An example is presented from material developed for an electromagnetic fields course."
"It is argued that preparing engineers for the challenging problems of present-day industry should involve the extension of homework problems to include realistic complications of nonlinearity and extensive use of the available computing facilities. This point of view has been illustrated through a simple Faraday's law problem of an electromechanical system that exhibits nonlinear effects if the resistance of the rails is taken into account. The procedure that is employed in this short note to solve the nonlinear equation is simple enough to be introduced at an undergraduate level for the engineering students."
"A way to encourage a student to examine critically what he is reading is to give him a system analysis which contains some fault which leads to a false conclusion. The fault should be rather subtle and can be either a logical error or a bad assumption. Three examples are presented: (1) The magnetic rectifier, a coil which produces a dc component in the current when an ac voltage is applied. (2) The signal-to-noise ratio amplifier, a circuit for a communication receiver which improves the signal-to-noise ratio by 3 db. (3) A single-phase-to-three-phase converter, a device which produces a three-phase output with a single-phase input voltage."
"New measurement and evaluation methods for an instructional program are introduced. The traditional program evaluation has been based on student performance for frame responses and scores of pre-and post-tests. In this short note, the concept of \"Response Time\" which was introduced by F. Hermanson-Snickars et al., is presented in order to better evaluate the program [1]. Response time is that time which a particular student takes for execution of a frame or a limited sequence of frames. First, this short note introduces a measurement method by which it is possible to measure response time under usual programmed instruction conditions without special equipment. Next, frame construction is evaluated through the analysis of average response time and error rates. Moreover, a response time distribution for each frame is investigated in order to improve the program."
"The subject of physiological modeling has been introduced in two conventional electrical engineering courses. Models of the respiratory process, waste generation, oxygen exchange, enzyme kinetics, and blood flow have been introduced. Although most engineering students have little background in physiology, it has been possible to introduce models that can be useful in the design of medical devices that must be compatible with a complex system."

  "This paper reports on, and summarizes the major ramifications of, the New York State study of technology education at the baccalaureate level; reviews those rationales giving rise to the development of bachelor of technology degree programs; poses problems and issues associated with the degree; and discusses dangers and challenges for the future. While not necessarily advocating the cessation of these programs, the research reveals areas of serious conflict between the original intent of the educational programs and the reported actual needs of industry and students. The paper has the express purpose of highlighting the areas of confusion, demonstrating the potential problems caused thereby, and suggesting areas for urgent attention by students, educators, employers, and engineering professionals. Such attention is necessary to stimulate or reinforce action by licensing boards, professional societies, and accrediting organizations."
"Taking advantage of techniques developed in the field of Computer Science, a laboratory based on a minicomputer system has been generated for the general purpose simulation of analog and digital communication systems. Using a graphics terminal, a student user may specify the characteristics of his desired system and then dynamically examine time and frequency domain displays as the information-bearing signal propagates through his system. The system user describes his system initially in terms of an Information Flow graph which identifies all system nodes, their interconnections, and characteristics. This graph is then represented in the simulation as a chained User Program. The execution of that User Program simulates the communication system. Emphasis in this system is placed on the ability to model physical processes and the use of graphical displays to relate the model to the process itself. In addition, the characteristics of a minicomputer facility to duplicate the simulation system discussed here are presented."
"This paper describes a digital control laboratory facility which teaches the central concepts of digital control without requiring a background in digital systems and/or machine language programming. The heart of the laboratory is a flexible hardware digital controller replacing the traditional analog control components in a D. C. servo system. The digital controller can be adjusted to provide versions of the standard PID control algorithm with adjustable word length and computation delay. Through a series of graded experiments this hardware can provide: (1) an introduction to digital control concepts and components, (2) an introduction to digital signal processing, (3) experience with basic DDC algorithms, (4) experience with problems encountered in the choice of sampling rate and digital word length, and (5) experience in working with and trouble-shooting an operating digital control system. Since one controller can be provided for each laboratory station the student has considerable freedom to learn by doing at his own rate."
"This paper describes an experiment in establishing and maintaining standards for a large course and assigning grades based on those standards The continuing experiment began in the spring of 1971 and has included some thirty instructors and more than 4000 students in an introductory computer science course. Some of the experience, both positive and negative, is reported for those interested in trying such a scheme."
"An inexpensive, easy-to-use instructional aid for demonsting digital and logic circuitry consists of an IC breadboading socket and associated electronics integrated with a portble blackboard."
"The use of system design projects in the education of senior engineering students is discussed. In an experiment with such a project at the University of Iowa, students learned many technical and human lessons by partitioning the assigned class project into small subsystem problems, designing and building the subsystems, solving the interface problems, and testing the overall project. This kind of system experience is a natural extension of the typical freshman design course in which students learn to solve problems in groups. Here the more sophistocated skills of the seniors are incorporated into the individual group designs, and there is the additional incentive of maidng the individual projects work together to achieve a goal common to the entire class."
"A self-paced introductory computer programming course is descrbed which accomodates a wide range of student interest, while incorporating standard elements of the Keller Plan together with some elements specific to computer programmng courses. These elements include: study guides to lead students through the material; variable unit credit for variable amounts of work; frequent one-to-one interaction between students and staff; occasional formal lectures on difficult topics; a choice of several programming languages (FORTRAN or BASIC) and texts; and a choice of different progranuning assignment packages. In addition, emphasis is placed on the concept of an algorithm, as distinct from programming, in the first unit of the course."

    "With the rapid expansion of the nuclear industry, safeguarding of nuclear materials against diversion and of nuclear facilities against sabotage becomes increasingly important both domestically and internationally. The USA safeguards research and development program will be reviewed with special emphasis on nondestructive measurement techniques for material accountability."
"The use of lasers to initiate fusion of the heavy isotopes of hydrogen for production of commercial electric power has been under investigation for the past five years at a significant level. While some problems have been identified, a great deal of progress has been made including the observation of substantial compression. The present outlook is promising and the laser technique now is recognized as a possible alternate to magnetic containment techniques for fusion power applications."
"Recent observations have marked the transition of gamma ray astronomy from a discovery phase to an exploratory one. This has been the result of the development of a number of very sophisticated sensitive telescopes and the opportunity to place them on space platforms. A survey of the instruments developed for this research is given together with a brief summary of the current status of the observational results. These include the studies of galactic gamma ray emission, the diffuse, presumably extragalactic, gamma radiation and localized gamma ray sources. The study of the spatial distribution of galactic gamma radiation is beginning to provide a new means for the study of galactic structure and dynamics. The diffuse emission may provide evidence of gamma ray emission in the cosmological past, although improved observations must be obtained before the picture can be clarified. The study of localized sources has shown NP0532, the Crab radio pulsar, to be a gamma ray pulsar also and strong emission from Vela may be due to supernova produced cosmic rays interacting with the remnant gas."
"This paper reviews recent calculations and experiments dealing with charge transport and capture in activated alkali halide scintillators. Both electrons and holes are captured at thallium sites in crystals such as KI(Tl) and NaI(Tl). The kinetics of charge transport is governed either by the diffusive motion of the self-trapped hole, or by the release of electrons from a thallium site."
"The time resolution of a scintillation detector can be calculated from the scintillator illumination function, and the response of the photomultiplier to an instantaneous pulse of light. Such calculations using the parameters of present scintillators and photomultipliers agree with measured resolutions and predict improvements which can be achieved. Parameters of commercial and some promising experimental fast scintillators are given, as well as measurements on transit time spread of some fast photomultipliers."
"Potential use of high-Z semiconductor detectors operating in the charge collection mode as γ-ray spectrometers at ambient temperatures appears to be limited by charge collection problems. Improvements in present scintillators through improved linearity and higher fluorescent efficiency appear possible. T. C. Madden, et al., 1 suggested the use of isoelectronic scintillators as an improved scintillator material. We have studied the possibility of using one of these, Te doped CdS, as a γ-ray spectrometer."
"The room-temperature scintillation characteristics of single crystals of Bi4Ge3O2 under gamma-ray and alpha-particle excitation have been determined. The wavelength of maximum intensity in the scintillation spectrum is 480 nm. A decay constant of 0.30 microseconds was measured. Scintillation efficiency (pulse height) varied linearly with gamma-ray energy, E, and the resolution varied as E-1/2. 8% pulse height relative to NaI(Tl) with 15% resolution was measured for a 2.2 cm × 1.7 cm crystal under excitation by Cs137 0.662 Mev gamma-rays."
"It has been observed that loading plastic scintillators with tin or lead markedly increase their low energy photon detection efficiencies while retaining the characteristic short phosphor decay time of conventional plastic scintillators, These combined effects may have great impact in high rate photon detection: for instance, x-ray transmission 3-D image reconstruction applications in the biomedical field and Mössbauer experiments in nuclear structure studies, Experimental data are here reported on a) photon detection efficiencies using a 5% tin loaded, a 7% tin loaded and a 57% lead loaded plastic scintillator with reference to a NaI(Tl) crystal in the energy range of 20-511 keV; b) high count rate detection up to 20 MHz with 153Gd (42 + 100 keV groups); and c) Mössbauer experiments with thin discs of tin loaded plastic scintillators."
"Lithium fluoride (activated) crystals were prepared by the Bridgeman-Stockbarger and Czochralski methods. Measurements have been made on the scintillation response of a LiF crystal to photon energies between 8 and 1333 keV. The tissue dose in rads was calculated and compared to the response of the LiF crystal over the same energy range. The response of a single titanium-activated LiF crystal was compared to the response of a NE 109 air-equivalent scintillator at 60Co energies. The absorption and emission spectra of the LiF crystal were obtained."
"Trajectories of cosmic rays through a Goddard Space Flight Center - Max Planck Institute balloon-borne experiment will be determined by pulse height analyzing the signals from each of the two or more phototubes coupled to each scintillator. Thin or tapered scintillators produce sufficiently strong gradients of phototube signal with respect to scintillation position that position uncertainties of ≈ 1 cm can be achieved over ~ 1m2 areas. Calculations and some test results for entopistic, or position determining, scintillators are presented."
"Thin film plastic scintillator detectors were fabricated and calibrated with x rays in the 1.5-20 keV range. The calibration systems used are described. Measurements showed that the presence of a film substrate can significantly change the detector response. X-ray conversion efficiency was determined as a function of energy and shown to be a strong function of energy for low energy x rays."
"The scintillation response of a CsI(Tl) crystal to energy degraded fission fragments derived from a 252Cf spontaneous fission source has been measured over the energy ranges 34-51 MeV (heavy fragment) and 42-74 MeV (light fragment). The response to γ-ray induced electrons and to α-particles was also measured for comparison purposes. The results indicate that the scintillation response for these particles is a monotonically decreasing function of specific energy loss."
"To evaluate cosmic-ray measurements, the chord length distributions for various elongations of cylindrical detectors were determined for isotropic and nonisotropic (J = J0Cosγθ) radiation fields by Monte Carlo techniques. The mean chord lengths obtained from the calculations are in excellent agreement with those obtained from Cauchy's theory."
"Various geometrical configurations for gas scintillation proportional counters have been investigated in order to determine which is best for use in a large volume, high efficiency counter for measuring low energy gamma and x-rays. A xenon filled counter having a rod anode inside a cylindrical cathode appears to provide the best configuration for providing a uniform field and the best resolution over the total volume of the counter. The details of construction and operating characteristics of various shaped counters are described."
"A new type of gas proportional scintillation counter with uniform electric field is described. This counter is the scintillation counter analog of the Frish ionization chamber. Its principle is discussed and the properties experimentally studied using pure argon. Energy resolutions of 1.9% were obtained for 8.1 MeV alpha particles. Some results concerning the interpretation of the mechanism of the secondary scintillation are discussed."
"The behaviour of xenon and argon-xenon gas proportional scintillation counters is con sidered. For X-rays, ranges of window area are defined showing competition with semiconductor detectors. Data for primary scintillation of X-rays and alpha particles are included. Relative efficiencies of tetraphenylbutadiene, p-terphenyl, diphenyl-stilbene, sodium salicylate and p-quaterphenyl were measured."
"Laser radar data acquisition systems have been utilized in conjunction with a light emitting diode to evaluate photomultipliers for laser radar use. Light pulses with an exponential decay rate of approximately one decade per sixty microseconds, as well as other pulse shapes, were used to drive the tubes. Properties studied in the analog mode include nonlinearity at high output currents, transient behavior upon gating, gate holdoff, dynamic range limitations because of light-induced noise, and the effect of dynode gating on tubes without a focus grid. Some of these properties were also studied in the photon counting mode, along with single photoelectron pulse shape and afterpulsing. Tubes studied were the RCA 7265, the RCA 8852, and the RCA C1034. A brief description of the laser radar technique of atmospheric measurements is included."
"Measurements of quantum efficiency to heavy charged particles, in particular to the proton, in the range of 5 to 2 MeV were made with windowless electron multipliers Qn cathodes of beryllium oxide and aluminum oxide. The effects of oxide thickness on quantum efficiency were determined and some qualitative explanations have been made based on the simple ionization process and escape probability of produced electrons. Using a Van de Graaff accelerator at beam currents of lnA to 5nA, precisions of measurement of better than 10% were obtainable with six different cathodes: three different thicknesses of BeO and three of Al2O3 respectively."
 "A review of recent work concerning dead layers at the surface of p-i-n detectors is given. Surface states, produced during preparation of the detector or by adsorbed gases at its surface, often lead to a surface channel. In the high-resistivity active volume of the detectors the thickness of the surface channel can be as much as 1 mm. The charge collection within a surface channel is disturbed and it is shown, by theory and experiment, that this results in the dead layers frequently observed on p-i-n detectors."
"Measurements of the Schottky barrier heights formed by evaporating various metals onto etched slices of n type Ge show that the barrier height and the reverse leakage current depend on the metal work function. The results are consistent with a surface state density on the Ge ≥ 5 × 1013/cm2·eV. Only metals with work functions > 4.4 eV give acceptably small reverse currents at 80 K. Of these, evaporated Ni or Pd are judged to be best for spectrometers."
"Relative measurements of the average energy, ε, expended for electron-hole pair generation in silicon and high purity germanium detectors were made using 10 to 19 MeV proton, deuteron and alpha particle beams. The results show that ε is constant for different particles in high purity germanium detectors but not in silicon detectors. A model is presented which could explain both our results and those published in the literature."
"Seven high resolution, high-purity planar germanium and two lithium-drifted germanium detectors have been exposed to fluences of monoenergetic fast neutrons of 1.4, 5.5 and 16.4 MeV to study radiation damage effects. Seven of the exposures were made at 5.5 MeV using detectors made from both LBL and General Electric Company material. Initial degradation of 60Co energy resolution was generally observed after fluences of 3 × 10+9 n/cm2. After fluences of 1010 n/cm2, the detector resolutions were all affected, and replacement would be required in most gamma ray spectrometry; these results are consistent with previous damage studies on germanium detectors. Considerable variability in neutron damage threshold between detectors was observed within this fluence range which must be attributable to a material parameter that is not yet fully determined. This is the major finding in this study. After irradiation, a significant increase in material resistivity was observed as a series resistance in the diodes undepleted region at low biases. The observations were made by capacitance effects and lengthened pulse rise time. Annealing of damage was observed during storage at LN2 temperature after irradiation; resulting, in some cases, in improvement of resolution and in others, further degradation. Drastic resolution degradation was observed on cycling detectors to dry ice temperatures, (200° K) with the loss of the high series resistance and an increase in acceptor concentration. Further cycling to room temperature for periods of hours resulted in improvement of the energy resolution compared with the 200° K value."
"It is shown that natural diamond can be used as a homogeneous conduction counter with near complete charge collection, even over a long period of time. Indeed, polarization effects have been suppressed by making the back contact of the detector injecting under the influence of the applied field in order to compensate for trapped charge carriers. The electric and detection characteristics of these counters have been investigated. Possible application fields are briefly discussed."
"Experiments on fast neutron spectrometry using the nuclear radiation diamond detector inside a horizontal channel of a water-cooled and water-moderated reactor are described. It is shown that the diamond detector enables neutron spectra to be measured within the energy range of 0.3 - 10MeV against reactor gamma-radiation background and has radiation resistance higher than that of conventional semiconductor detectors."
"The detailed pulse form for pulses with abnormally long rise times have been measured in two different Ge(Li)-detectors. Most of these pulses show distinctive differences from normal pulse shapes. These deviations can be explained by the existence of local zones with highly reduced electric field strength, which lead to long drift times and an increased trapping probability. The observed correlation between abnormal pulse shapes and nonideal charge collection is discussed."
"A Li-diffused n+ surface layer is the best n+ contact developed up to the present time. However, the effective dead layer resulting from the Li-diffusion prevents the optimum stacking of detectors for counter telescopes. Diffusion temperatures as low as 160°C have been successfully used to produce effective dead layers as thin as 10 μ. Unfortunately, these dead layers increase significantly when the detector is annealed following radiation damage."
"Planar Ge(Li) detectors of side-entry type were prepared with the aim of minimizing dead layer effects. The cryostat employed was connected to a scattering chamber without the use of a window. Detector resolution was determined for protons of 44.1 MeV, deuterons of 62.9 and 80.7 MeV and ∝-particles of 155.5 MeV, elastically scattered on a Au target under θlab = 15°, as well as for 83.9 MeV protons from a (d,p)-reaction. Overall resolution figures ΔE(fwhm)/E, comprising contributions from experimental set-up and detector system, were in the range from 3.4 to 4.4 × 10-4."
"The growth of red mercuric iodide single crystals by a dynamic sublimation method is described. Their characterization has been performed by means of optical and electrical measurements. Nuclear radiation detectors have been prepared with this material and their properties are evaluated in terms of a particles, γ- and X-rays spectrometry, detection efficiency, electron-hole pair creation energy and polarization effects. Finally the potential use of mercuric iodide in nuclear detection is discussed."
"Charge carrier drift velocities in semiconductor materials suitable for solid state detectors has been reviewed. Si, Ge, CdTe and GaAs are considered. New data for HgI2 recently obtained are also reported. The data cover a large range of temperatures (6-430 K) and electric fields up to 50 KV/cm. An anisotropy effect in the drift velocity obtained by applying the electric field parallel to different crystallographic axis is also discussed for the case of Si and Ge."
"Considerable interest has been generated recently in the use of high-Z semiconductors for x-ray spectroscopy. To aid in this study, a Monte-Carlo computational model has been used to simulate x-ray spectral response in semiconductor detectors. The model employs one-dimensional charge collection in an arbitrary electric field profile and includes trapping and electronics system effects. Spectra are calculated for several materials, including HgI2 and CdTe, and are compared to experimental results."
"The characteristics and performance of undoped high resistivity cadmium telluride detectors are compared to chlorine compensated counters. It is shown, in particular, that \"undoped\" CdTe Is in fact aluminium doped and that compensation occurs, as in silicon or germanium, by pair and triplet formation between the group III donor and the doubly charged cadmium vacancy (Vcd) acceptor. Furthermore, in chlorine doped samples, the polarization effect results from the unpaired (Vcd) level at Ec -0. 6 eV."
"The intrinsic resolution of low energy photopeaks with CdTe detectors is shown to be improved if the detectors are illuminated with a GaAs electroluminescent diode. Time of flight measurements on this CdTe material exhibit a strong modification of the current response under a given monochromatic infra-red illumination. The interpretation involves trapping effect and its optical quenching."
"Both space-charge-limited current and space-charge-free current pulses for electron and hole injection in HgI2 crystals have been observed using the Pulsed Laser Transient Charge Technique. A semi-quantitative theoretical analysis is made based on the assumption of a semi-insulating material. The current pulse analysis includes trapping, detrapping, field dependent trapping times (in both space charge free and limited cases), and plasma dispersal times. Measurement of trapping times and mobilities for both types of carriers are made from the pulse shapes. Measured values for the mobilities of both electrons and holes and trapping times are comparable to previous measurements using different techniques. The experimental techniques are also described. Lastly, the crystal growing techniques are outlined."
"A method involving the generation of charge carriers by nuclear particles (α-particles or γ-rays) and measuring the charge collection efficiency or counting rate while simultaneously exciting with monochromatic light has been used for the study of deep traps in CdTe intended for semiconductor detectors. The electric field distribution may be determined by looking at the shape of the pulse. A way of directly observing the electric field was to utilize the electrooptic effect of CdTe, which has the zincblende structure, by viewing the optical transmission between crossed polarizers as a function of applied bias and time. These techniques have been applied to CdTe but can be applied to other materials."
"The semiconductor Bi2S3 has a bandgap of 1.3 eV and reported mobilities of 200 cm2/V for holes and 1100 cm2/V for electrons. Its absorption cross section is 1.8 times that of Hg I2. We report compensation of this material to 107 to 109 Ω-cm and initial results on γ-ray detection properties."
"The basic properties of drift chambers such as space resolution are discussed. The performance of various types of drift chambers is reported, e.g. chambers with high space and time resolution (Δ x = 0.25 mm fwhm, Δ t = 6.3 ns fwhm), very large area chambers (ca. 16 m2) for a neutrino experiment, cylindrical chambers for colliding beam experiments."
"We have developed and tested a thermal neutron, two-dimensional position-sensitive detector for use in neutron scattering from biological samples. The detector is based on a multi-wire proportional concept with a gas filling of 6 atmos. He3, 4 atmos. A, and 0.5 atmos. CO2. The position readout uses a resistive wire with charge division to determine position. We have measured a resolution of less than 3 mm (EWHM) with a detection efficiency of 70% at 2.8 Å neutrons. Considerations leading to an optimal configuration are discussed."
"Properties of proportional chambers with spherical drift spaces have been investigated. An experiment of X-ray diffraction in crystals shows that an accuracy of 0.5 mm, at 20° inclination with respect to the axis of the chamber, can be obtained with 4 cm of drift length. Such chambers have many applications: X-ray diffraction patterns, pin-hole imaging, angular distributions of cascades of X-rays in nuclear physics, etc."
"A MWPC with an active area of 30 × 4 cm2 has been developed using two-dimensional delay-line readout. To avoid the problems associated with long wires, the anode and cathode wires are oriented at 45° to the X and Y axes; this is important for further extension in one direction. New electromagnetic delay lines for wire chamber readout with high bandwidth and low attenuation are used. The X-Y spatial resolution has been measured to be about 0,5 mm FWHM."
"Because one can operate organic quenched counters near atmosoheric pressure, they can be built with large area (250 cm2), thin (7 mg/cm2) windows to monitor large areas of low energy ß activity. To avoid the problem of short life (~ 108 counts) they are only biassed during a shortened monitoring period and are shielded against background radiation."
"Chemical reactions at the cathode in a beryllium proportional counter with CO2 quench gas are analyzed. It is shown that the CO2 will be dissociated at the cathode. It is further shown that the counter will be contaminated with carbon as the CO produced as a result of the CO2 dissociation, is in turn dissociated at the cathode. The dissociation of CO2 quench gas is offered as a plausible hypothesis for the carbon contamination and the accompanying instability often encountered in such a counter towards the end of its life."
"The response of 30 in. diameter NaI(Tl) crystal detectors to electrons in the GeV range is described, and experience acquired in the operation of such detectors in physics experiments is summarized."
"A cylindrical multiwire proportional chamber operating within the vacuum tank of a rapid-cycling bubble chamber is described. The system is used in conjunction with the SLAC Ko-spectrometer to allow the selection of event topologies of several types of KoL p reactions having small cross sections (~ 0.1 to 1 mb) in comparison with the total cross section (~ 25 mb). Construction of the chamber, its electronics, data acquisition, and operational characteristics are presented."
"Multiwire proportional chambers, with high-density drift spaces attached, have been developed as position-sensitive detectors for non-ionizing radiation. A chamber with a 5 g/cm3 drift space comprising a lead-bismuth converter of 0.8 mm round holes on a 1 mm pitch has been investigated. The detection efficiency is 14% at 0.5 MeV, rising to 18% at 0.66 MeV, with a spatial resolution of 1 mm. Higher efficiencies are possible. These chambers offer new possibilities for photon and neutron detection, and for shower detectors for high-energy particles."
 "We have constructed a fast analog processor for use in a high energy small angle scattering experiment. The processor uses data from high resolution multiwire proportional chambers to select beam tracks inside \"good\" phase space and measures the scattering angle. The result of the calculations is available within 5μs."
"A 50 × 50 cm2 area 1 cm drift spacing High Accuracy Parallel Foil Drift Chamber was built and successfully operated.1 This chamber produces an overall average spatial resolution σ = 80μm in the entire drift space. This type of drift chamber has excellent field unifonmity in the electron drift region, high count rate capability and relatively small memory time, 192 nsec."
"The Modulation Transfer Functions (MTF) of two commercial cameras and of a single element germanium camera fitted with different collimator configurations have been studied theoretically and experimentally in order to separate the different elements which contribute to the imaging capabilities of a gamma camera. Effects due to size and shape of collimator holes, and to positron range at 511 keV have been treated as filtering functions, predicting the behavior of a camera quite accurately. The effect of energy resolution has then been studied by noting the changes in MTF and the corresponding changes in the computer generated image of a low contrast circularly symmetric phantom as a function of energy resolution. The possibility of excellent imaging under low contrast situations with high-energy resolution detectors is demonstrated, and the required penalty in camera speed is documented."
"A figure of merit is derived for the efficiency with which a detector images a γ-ray emitting object using the signal-to-noise ratio as the criterion. Photons scattered in the detector that ultimately culminate in photoelectric absorption produce an undesirable background when imaging with position-sensitive detectors as in cameras. When imaging with detectors that are not position sensitive as in scanners, these photons contribute to the image of the object. In comparison with NaI(Tl), Ge detectors have lower photoelectric efficiency and higher detector scatter. However, these are offset by much higher energy resolution and the consequent near complete tissue-scatter rejection. As a result, the imaging efficiency for a brain phantom at 150 keV is shown to be comparable for Ge and NaI(Tl) cameras. In the case of scanners, the imaging efficiency of Ge was calculated to be 40-75% higher for a brain phantom with a one γ-ray emitting radionuclide such as 99mTc, and effectively 2-2.5 times higher for a three γ-ray emitting radionuclide such as 67Ga. The imaging efficiency, which depends on absorption characteristics and energy resolution, is a measure of the total performance of the detector. It is shown that in addition to being useful for comparing different types of detectors, this figure of merit also provides means for optimizing imaging parameters such as detector thickness."
"A comparative study of four popular 3-D image reconstruction algorithms has been made. Particular attention was given to artifacts generated and noise sensitivity. The methods considered include two spatial domain convolution algorithms, the Linear Superposition with Compensation (LSC) and a Fourier Convolution Method (FCM), a direct Fast Fourier Transform method (FFT), and an algebraic technique, the Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Technique (SIRT). The methods were compared by computing reconstructed images for an identical input phantom image. The phantom image contains several edges and a 2% contrast object. Variations, artifacts and noise sensitivity are easily visualized by perspective plots of the reconstructed images. Considerations as to the optimum algorithm for a particular application are discussed."
"Tomographic scanners of the parallel beam and fan beam type have differences in the direction of sweep, r vs. ϕ respectively. This leads to different options in the \"fill\" of the sampling space, which may be important in accurate reconstruction. These differences are denoted in reference to the Radon integrational method of reconstruction. An algorithm using source angle gating of data from a fan beam scanner is given with a reconstruction from a simulation phantom scan which used discrete source and detector apertures with rotation smearing."
  "Coded shadows of gamma-ray distributions have been made using both random pinhole and non-redundant pinhole coded apertures with a multiwire proportional chamber as detector. Image reconstruction is done optically with incoherent light. Lateral and depth resolution results are presented and calculations of background and signal to noise ratios for the nonredundant aperture are made and compared with the single pinhole collimator."
"In 1968 Dicke proposed coded imaging of x and μ rays via random pinholes. Since then, many authors have agreed with him that this technique can offer significant image improvement. We present a best linear decoding of the coded image and show its superiority over the conventional matched filter decoding. Experimental results in the visible light region are presented."
"This paper outlines our experience over the past decade, with a multichannel miniature semiconductor detector system for measurement of miniregional cerebral blood flow. 8 channels of a lithium drifted silicon detector system with on-line computer analysis are satisfactorily operating in monitoring quantitative regional cerebral blood flow on multisites of the brain in vivo in humans as well as animals. More recently, our experience with a highly gamma sensitive Cadmium Telluride detector (CdTe) was disappointing. For 133Xe clearance studies, the CdTe detector gave a 5 times higher counting efficiency than the Si(Li) detector. However, blood flow values obtained by Stochastic analysis from the CdTe detector are 25 to 40% less than the values obtained from the Si(Li) detector. This problem appears to be mainly due to a trapping phenomenon occurring in the CdTe detector which gives a non-linear response between radioactivity and count rate, and over exceeds random fluctuation of count rate. These genetic and temperamental features of the CdTe detector make it unsuitable for use in measurement of cerebral blood flow at the present time. Our clinical and laboratory experience with miniature semiconductor systems will be reviewed."
  "In bioluminescence the amount of light emitted in vivo from a single specimen is in general so small that conventional spectral recording techniques are not useful. A specially designed fast input lens grating spectroscope has been combined with a high gain image intensifier. The light from the specimen is directed to the input slit of the spectroscope by means of a fiber optics light pipe. The system is calibrated by means of a standard lamp. A digitized densitometer provides input to a computor program which corrects for system non-uniformities and prints out spectra at 150 intensity levels every 4 Å from 4000 Å to 6000 Å. The system has been applied to the observation of in vivo spectra from many different species of bioluminescent organisms."
"An image intensifier film system has been used to obtain X-ray diffraction patterns suitable for quantitative measurements of protein structure. Relevant image tube characteristics have been measured, as have the corresponding TV vidicon parameters for extension of the systems to on-line digital recording and analysis."
"The analysis and design of the instrumentation required to provide spatial and energy information from a high purity germanium, one-dimensional position sensing gamma ray detector is presented. The results of this study demonstrate that the optimum instrumentation system utilizes Gaussian shaping for the energy channel and Gaussian trapezoidal pulse shaping after antisymmetric summation in the spatial channel."
"A well was constructed with cadmium telluride detectors and used at room temperature to detect 27.4 keV x-rays from 125I for the purpose of determining the concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen in human plasma. Concentrations were in good agreement with that earlier determined using a NaI well. For individual detectors approximately 1 to 2 cm2 in area and operating near 0°C, detector resolutions as low as 3 keV (FWHM) were obtained."
"This paper describes the ORTEC 4840 Cerebral Blood Flow System (Figures 1 & 2). This system is used to measure the clearance rate of radioisotopes from brain tissue. This measures the regional cerebral blood flow (Glass & Harper1). The system can be separated logically into two major sections and subdivided thus: Hardware 1. Radiation detectors and support electronics 2. Computer interfacing of input and output devices using the CAMAC system 3. ADC for initial calibration of single channel analyzers 4. Computer and peripherals Software 1. calibration routines 2. Data acquisition routines 3. Data reduction routines 4. Data display and plotting routines 5. UItility programs"
"It is of value in given instances to be able to determine the variation of principal element concentration and electronic density in a body. Such measurements have application in medical and industrial areas. This paper describes a technique for undertaking such measurements. Preliminary data are presented which indicate the plausibility of the technique using high resolution detectors. Further work is required to fully evaluate and develop the technique."
"Signals from sense wires in drift chambers are of μA amplitude and nsec duration. Their time position depends on the drift time and indicates at what distance from the wire the particles passed through the chamber. These times must be measured with accuracies of the order of 2 nsec. A review of circuits and techniques to detect the signals and to measure drift times is given."
"A high-potential isolated circuit for remotely measuring, monitoring, and crowbarring high-voltage power supplies at a variable preset current threshold level is described. It is presently being used in a high-energy physics experiment utilizing proportional chambers which require self-destruct protection from high-current discharges. An absolute current threshold of one microampere has been achieved. The circuit is not damaged by momentary current overloads of ten amperes or less."
"A novel ADC is described, consisting in its simplest and fastest version of a parallel ADC supplying the most significant bits, plus several suitably-connected difference amplifiers in which the input signal undergoes successive folding. Their common output is fed into another parallel ADC which supplies the least significant bits. The conversion rate is of the order of 400 MHz for eight bits. Several versions are described, yielding different trade-offs between speed and the number of discriminators employed."
"A nuclear pulse amplifier using a time-variant filter with a trapezoidal weighting function was theoretically analyzed for optimum performance in a high count rate environment. Analytical tools were developed for the complete characterization of the noise performance of the amplifier. The amplifier was implemented and experimentally evaluated at high count rates. The Na22 line had a peak shift and line broadening no more than 1 part per 1000 when the count rate was varied from a low rate of 5000 cps to a very high rate at 150,000 cps."
"The characteristics of baseline restorers (stabilizers) at high count rates were investigated. The analyses included both of the basic types of baseline restorers: 1) the non-linear circuit realizations (BLR), and 2) the time-variant stabilizers based on the gated differentiator concept. The advantage of the TVS over the BLR was demonstrated. Two new count rate effects were described. One is the count rate dependence of the noise error introduced by the stabilizer. Another one is the count rate dependent low frequency noise, which causes a reduction of the effectiveness of baseline restorers in cancelling low frequency interference at high count rates."
"A baseline restorer (BLR) for pulse amplifiers is described in which current to the memory capacitor can be gated off during a pulse. This technique reduces the BLR recovery time without introducing artifacts when a short-period undershoot accompanies the input signal. The gating and reset thresholds are adjustable, as is the BLR symmetry. Tests with a pulse generator show that the baseline shift with 5V pulses at duty factors up to 75% is less than 1mV. When the signal source is a radiation detector, the gated BLR is usable at duty factors up to 90%."
"In the design of nuclear-counting systems it is sometimes desirable to perform simple arithmetic operations on the collected data in order to present it in a more useful form. In many cases these calculations do not require a high-speed processor, and thus can be performed simply and inexpensively through the use of calculator chips. This paper describes the use of a calculator chip in a portable, battery-operated device designed to measure the radon-daughter concentration in air samples from uranium mines."
"A computer network architecture consisting of a common node processor for managing peripherals and files and a number of private node processors for laboratory experiment control is briefly reviewed.

"During the development of a computer network for diverse real-time applications in physics and chemistry, a system was designed and developed to provide interfacing of instruments to each other as well as to a computer, and also to facilitate utilization of advanced solid state electronics in custom instruments. The result is a well-documented interfacing system with features and capabilities which are of growing importance in scientific and process instrumentation. This paper focuses attention on the distinctive features of the new system, features which are not usually available in CAMAC. These include the use of decentralized control, the addressing scheme, the monitor and control capabilities, the fast cycle time, and the simplicity of using the system."

The EBSD can be operated in either a bit serial or a byte serial mode."
"A simple, versatile crate controller has been in use in CAMAC installations at SLAC for several years. Its design is based upon the criteria of minimum circuitry to connect seven CAMAC crates together on a \"SLAC branch\". A priority encoding module to rapidly identify interrupt sources has been designed to work in conjunction with this crate controller for high rate interrupt environments. The concept is applicable to the standard branch as well."
"Electronics systems for space missions have often been highly constrained by weight and power as well as performance. This led to highly customized designs for most missions. With the advent of the Shuttle launch vehicle and spacecraft, and the Spacelab concept in the late 1970' s, it will be possible to fly payloads of several very large experiments for periods of 7 to 30 days. For such experiments weighing several thousand Kg, ~100 Kg of supporting electronics is quite acceptable and this weight is adequate to acomplish the design in NIM and CAMAC for a large variety of experiments. Power consumption is a problem both from the point of view of sizing of the fuel cells and thermal consequences. Several studies are now underway on reducing this power consumption and the outlook is promising. The motivation for the usage of NIM and CAMAC on Shuttle is not only convenience to the experimenter, but a substantial cost savings originally, and still more in the future as the modules are reconfigured for yet another experiment."
"Much pioneering work in CAMAC has been done at Harwell, leading to one of the first comprehesnsive ranges of CAMAC equipment.

The development of both hardware and software, the logic for controlling the examination, and the utilization of the CAMAC standard are discussed. Expansion of this system to include several new examinations will determine whether or not further automation of the facilities is feasible."
"Software based on the CAMAC standards has been developed for a real-time data acquisition and process control system. The system is used to control the examination of irradiated fuel elements. Employing CAMAC in software has resulted in the development of a standard method of addressing the acquisition and control hardware. A description of a subroutine that outputs command words to the CAMAC system, checks for transmission errors, and checks for completion of the CAMAC handshake is presented. Use of this subroutine decreases programming time and training time due to system expansion or changes. Modularization of software through the use of subroutines has simplified programming of the software system."

It consists of two detection units together with a data handling unit. One detection unit comprises a 150 cm2 multiproportional counter detector with a 1.8 micron titanium window operating with a gas mixture of Ne + 10% CO2.

 "The MIT SAS-C S-Ray Observatory is a highly flexible facility for the comprehensive study of the X-ray sky over the 0.1 to 50 kev energy range. Event time may be determined to 0.125ms. An on-board 16 pulse height analyzer allows for fine X-ray spectral studies using the on-board star trackers and rotating modulation collimator. Both risetime and geometric anticoincidence circuits are employed and a programmable data format generator allows great flexibility in choice of data sources and source sampling rate for special studies."
"This paper describes the design and performance of a set of cosmic-ray particle experiments for the Pioneer 10/11 and Helios A/B space missions. These experiments had to be very light-weight, low-power and electronically sophisticated in order to meet the spacecraft and scientific requirements. Both sets of missions use several solid-state detector telescopes to measure protons from ~100 KeV to ~800 MeV and heavier ions up to Neon at ~200 MeV per nucleon. Good performance is required for 7-8 years, and the system must tolerate large vibration loads and ionizing radiation doses up to ~5×105 rads."

The Lo E and Hi E units are sensitive to electrons in the 30-300 keV and 0.2-2 MeV energy ranges respectively; the Lo P and Hi P units to protons between 100-500 keV and 0.5-150 MeV respectively. Five Lo E sensors are arranged at angles of 0°, ± 30°, and ± 60° with respect to the spacecraft equator in order to measure the three-dimensional angular distribution of the low energy electrons as the satellite spins. All detectors are silicon semiconductors with well collimated fields of view. The Hi P unit is a telescope of three detector elements which can also measure alpha particles in the energy range 1.2 to 600 MeV upon command."
"NIM and CAMAC standards were evaluated for use in Space Shuttle experiment payloads. Six payloads were studied and it was found that 30 to 90% of the electronic functions could be performed with standard, commercially available modules. Only minor modifications are required to adapt the standards to the Shuttle requirements."
"Fast coincidence and analog electronics have been developed to process signals from the scintillation and Cherenkov detectors of the triggering telescope, which forms part of the COS-B experiment for gamma ray astronomy. Design requirements and solutions for the electronics are presented, and the performance is discussed. Integrated circuits have been used extensively in order to minimise the number of components, hence volume and weight, and to optimise the reliability. The goals of a time resolution down to 3ns for a dynamic range of 1 to 30, a signal processing time of 200ns for timing and 500ns for analog analysis, a maximum temperature instability of the trigger thresholds of 2% of the typical signal amplitude over a range of 50°C and a maximum non-linearity of 1% of full scale for the pulse height analysis have been achieved."
"This paper describes a simple method of inflight calibration of pulse amplitude discriminator thresholds on satellite-borne particle detection experiments. The calibrator uses the discriminator output as a feedback control signal to adjust the average output of a test pulse generator. The test pulse amplitude is stabilized when the discriminator \"half-triggers\". The average control voltage is a direct measure of the pulse height discriminator threshold. Better than 1% accuracy is obtained over a 50:1 range of discriminator settings. Automatic ranging circuits extend the calibrator dynamic range to 5000:1."

Each unit consists of a multiproportional counter detector, a gas supply system and accompanying electronics, including an automatic gas gain - stabilization circuit. In the units detectors filled with Ne/CO2 as well as Ar/CO2 gas mixtures are being used. Measures are described to overcome pressure variations in the detector, total as well as partial, due to gas diffusion through the detector window."
 "A data compression counter which extracts the square root of a number of counts per unit time is presented as an alternative data compression scheme. The maximum error due to compression is equal to the one sigma statistical error. This system should have applications where data bandwidth is low and counting rate dynamic range is high; such as, Gamma Ray Bursts, Solar Flares or, in Exploratory Probes, where the counting rates are unknown."
"A large area (1 m × 1 m) double scattering telescope1 for balloon-borne research will be described here. It measures the flux, energy and direction of 2-100 MeV neutrons and 0.5-30 MeV gamma rays. These measurements are made using time-of-flight and pulse height analysis techniques with two large tanks of mineral oil liquid scintillator. Results from Monte Carlo calculations of the efficiency, energy resolution and angular resolution are presented and the electronics implementation for the processing of 80 photomultiplier tubes signals will be discussed. The detector weighs 800 kg with a large part of this weight being the liquid scintillator (320 kg). It will be flown at 3 mbars for flight durations up to 40 hours.

The detector is based on one described by Borkowski and Kopp, and is a two dimensional device that is capable of a spatial resolution of about one millimeter for photon energies exceeding 0.25 keV."
"A development program performed during the last year under a contract with the Office of Naval Research has indicated that diffraction focusing of X-rays may offer significant detection advantages when used to focus low energy gamma and X-radiation onto single detectors. The work which supports this conclusion includes a survey of diffraction crystalline materials, diffractometer X-ray measurements of selected crystal specimens, conceptual design studies of X-ray focusing systems, and finally, the fabrication and testing with a radioactive source of a small parabolic focusing array of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite flat crystals.1 The high diffraction efficiency of oriented graphite even to energies beyond 60 keV has encouraged the development of complete prototype focusing systems. As a part of this continuing effort an eighteen shell oriented graphite laboratory focuser is currently being developed. In order to supply the thousands of square inches of graphite required for this work, a facility has been assembled within General Electric Nuclear Systems Operation at Evendale, Ohio, to produce highly oriented pyrolytic graphite economically and in large quantities."

 "As a prelude to in-situ measurements of gamma exposure rates from reactor plumes, baseline terrestrial gamma-ray surveys have been run at five preoperational nuclear power stations: Fort St. Vrain, Colorado; Fort Calhoun, Nebraska; Cooper Nuclear Station, Nebraska; Rancho Seco, California, and Diablo Canyon, California. A pressurized ion chamber was used to measure the total exposure from cosmic rays and terrestrial radionuclides. A portable Ge(Li) spectrometer was used to make in-situ measurements of the radionuclide soil concentrations and of the individual external gamma exposure rates at the TLD sites. Subsequent measurements after start-up will enable accurate determinations of deposition and buildup of reactor produced fission products to be made. The application of the in-situ Ge(Li) spectrometer for real-time plume dose measurements is being investigated."
"A β-γ coincidence system using a thin plastic scintillator and a NaI(Tl) well crystal has been constructed for 131I environmental measurements. A background of 0.01 cpm with a system efficiency of 11% has been achieved. The detection limit is 0.08 pCi/l for a 100-minute counting period and otherwise usual conditions."
"A new field instrument for the continuous measurement of radon concentrations has been developed to investigate the magnitude and variability of environmental levels of 222Rn. Passive diffusion of radon, but not its daughters, occurs through an open pore polyurethane foam into a sensitive volume where a static electric field directs the positively ionized radon daughter products to a central collecting electrode. Pulses in a ZnS(Ag) scintillator, resulting from the alpha emission of 218Po and 214Po, are observed with a photomultiplier tube and counted using standard NIM electronics. The detector unit has been fabricated into a small, convenient package for indoor air sampling without the use of air movers or pumps. The unit is unobtrusive and acceptable into a daily routine without disrupting normal family or business activities. The monitor can detect as little as 0.5 pCi/l for a 40-min. count (α=.05). The equilibrium detection efficiency of the instrument is 0.7 cpm/pCi/l."
"Appropriate optical and electronic components used in conjunction with an improved scintillator solution allow alpha liquid scintillation spectroscopy with an energy resolution of 200 to 300 keV and a background of 0.01 to 0.005 cpm. Liquid-liquid extraction procedures allow selective extraction of nuclides of interest directly into the scintillator. Applications to environmental samples are illustrated."
"Krypton-85 from nuclear power generation is released to the atmosphere mainly during fuel reprocessing. The monitor described here is designed for use in the vicinity of these facilities. It is battery operated, resistant to weather exposure, and portable. Sensitivity has been verified in the field as 10-20 pCi/liter. The detector array uses two pairs of betasensitive dual window pancake GM tubes. One pair is shielded so that it provides a response to gamma photons only. The output of the two channels is stored on a computer-compatible serial magnetic cassette recorder."
"Measurement were made of the interaction of 8Kr, 133Xe, CH3I (131I) and I2 (131I) with various silver zeolites and activated charcoals under varying relative humidities and temperatures. Results show silver zeolite has significantly less interaction with noble gases and high adsorption efficiencies for CH3I making it superior to charcoal for airborne radioiodine monitoring. The penetration of airborne iodine activity into the silver zeolite filter bed was also examined. CH3I penetrated slightly deeper than I2 at the same air flow velocity; however, at 17.4 feet per minute, no more than 5% of the iodine activity in either form penetrated deeper than 1 cm into the filter bed. The sensitivity of the iodine-131 activity detection system was found to be approximately 2.5% (1% = 2.22 x 104 counts per minute/μCi) at the 364 Kev photopeak with a 100 Kev energy window width."
"A multi-parameter NaI(Tl)-Ge(Li) coincidence gamma-ray spectrometry system has been developed for the analysis of environmental samples from nuclear power industry radioactive effluents. Several detector configurations have been evaluated. Data acquisition is by buffer storage of the ADC output and final recording of each event in list mode on magnetic tape. A 16K computer and a 4096 channel, pulse height analyzer are used for accumulation of spectra from the data on magnetic tape. Display and software routines aid in the analysis of the spectral data. The system has been used to study environmental radiochemical analysis problems."
"Two sodium-immersed detectors, a microphone and an acoustic waveguide, have been developed, installed, and used for monitoring acoustic background of Experimental Breeder Reactor No. II (EBR-II). The microphone signal is free of structural resonances which appear in the signals from accelerometers mounted on the waveguide and various reactor components. Sound pressure level decreased by an order of magnitude when the primary sodium coolant flow was reduced from 100% to 50%. At full flow and independent of reactor power, the 1-millibar r.m.s. sound pressure as sensed by the sodium-immersed microphone had the characteristics of wideband noise over the frequency range 0.6 to 40 kHz."
"Tritiated water vapour in a sample air stream is collected in a water stream and measured in a scintillation flow counter. One μCi/m³ can be detected with a response time constant of several minutes. The instrument, engineered for unattended operation, is insensitive to other airborne radionuclides, gamma radiation, and humidity variation."
"Cable resistances (R) and breakdown-pulse-noise (BPN) were measured before, during, and after heating 60-cm portions of a 10-meter mineral-insulated coaxial cable to various temperatures (T), mostly 320°C. A severe BPN-condition and a very low R within about 60 cm of the high-T end of the cable was shown to be due to atmospheric moisture admitted through an end-seal leak inflicted by a previous test. A similar, but much less severe, BPN-condition 90 to 120 cm removed from either end was attributed to a small amount of moisture that had collected at these positions during the same previous test independent of the end-seal leak. These results suggest that the BPN problem might be eliminated by better hygroscopic measures in cable manufacture."
"An experimental investigation of the characteristics. of parallel plate fission chambers with fast (1-2 nsec rise time) current-pulse amplifiers has shown that chambers can be constructed which produce pulses with widths of 10 nsec and unambiguous separation of alpha particle pulses from the fission product pulses. Further improvement of this separation by geometric variations in chamber designs is discussed."
"Four multichannel detection systems, two operating in an integrated current mode and two in a pulse mode within the engineering mockup core for the Fast Flux Test Facility reactor, successfully furnished signals during a 5-month reactivity surveillance procedures experiment for evaluation of reactivity measurement methods and associated instrumentation for Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor applications. In addition, the adequacy of the low level flux monitor desigin for the Fast Flux Test Facility was verified."
"A fission counter was built and successfully tested for operation at 750°F and gamma dose rates up to 6 × 106 R/hr. Results from gamma and neutron tests were compared with theoretical predictions and used to optimize the performance of the counters."
"Changes in power level of large-core reactors are always accompanied by subsequent (transient as well as steady-state) changes in the concentration of Xenon. This, in turn, necessitates long-term control-rod operations to control the so-called \"Xenon Oscillations\". A method, based on optimal control theory, is presented in this paper to minimize the undesirable Xenon oscillations. It involves the programming of the reactivity changes necessary to accomplish the power level change, while minimizing the deviations of the power level as well as the Xenon and Iodine concentrations, from their final values. In accordance with optimal control theory and for an adequate problem formulation, a performance index is defined. The \"penalty\" associated with the deviations of the neutron flux, Xenon and Iodine concentrations, from their final values is to be minimized. A novel approach to bypass the difficulties encountered in the numerical solution of the resulting nonlinear Two Point Boundary Value Problem (TPBVP) is presented. The method uses an hierarchical structure to replace the actual nonlinear system by a set of sub-systems. The TPBVP for each subsystem is solved using the solution of the preceding one. This iterative method is discussed and is shown to achieve rapid convergence. Furthermore, the method reduces the amount of computational work needed, thus making it suitable for a minicomputer control application. The procedure described above yields a long-term optimal control law u*(t), i.e."
"On-line programmable calculator systems and programs have been developed to meet health physics and radiochemistry needs at a three-unit PWR nuclear plant. The system provides automatic energy and efficiency calibration, and automatic quantitative radionuclide analysis for liquid and gaseous reactor effluent releases, environmental samples, and whole body counting data. Programmable calculator systems are also in use at other power reactor facilities for personnel dosimetry record keeping, TLD information processing, and storage of data for scheduled AEC reports."
"Neutron detectors have been developed and applied to a variety of pulsed plasma sources with intensities ranging from 102 to 1012 neutrons/pulse. For yields as small as 102 neutrons, a 6Li-glass-scintillator detector is used. A rhodium-activation counter has been developed for yields greater than 106 neutrons. These detectors are used for total yield and angular distribution measurements. Neutron energies are determined primarily by the time-of-flight technique. Limitations on this technique for neutron yield and energy measurements are discussed. Improved methods are needed to measure the spatial extent of these neutron sources."
"A Nd-glass laser facility is described which is designed for studies of the laser-plasma interaction and for the development of special diagnostic instrumentation relevant to the problems of laserdriven fusion. The laser produces a 1-J, 200-psec pulse of 1.06-μm radiation which is focused into a 50--100-μm target spot to generate the plasma under study. An instrumentation package has been developed for performing x-ray diagnostic measurements to obtain information on plasma parameters. The package consists of a multichannel curved-crystal x-ray spectrograph (1 eV resolution at 1000 eV), calorimeters, and a fast x-ray diode (20-psec rise time) with a tenchannel single-shot sampler readout. This system records x-ray spectra, conversion efficiencies, and time histories of selected portions of the x-ray spectrum. With the integrated system, a complete set of data can be obtained on each laser shot."
"An in-line monitor used initially to continuously measure the 235U enrichment in liquid UF6 at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant has recently been recalibrated to provide continuous measurements of both 234U and 235U. The instrument using both a gamma-ray detector for 235U and a neutron detector for 234U has produced data that is in good agreement with precision mass spectrometric measuremic measurements made on related samples of UF6. Studies now in process suggest that the use of such minor isotope data will provide. the safeguards inspector with a useful additional tool in his efforts to independently verify the operations and nuclear material accountancy records of an isotope separation plant. The preliminary results indicate that an instrument originally developed to meet the operational problems of the plant can also make a significant contribution to the difficult problems of providing effective safeguards for an enrichment plant."
"High resolution gamma-ray measurements of plutonium isotopic and americium-241 concentrations are being used with a calorimetric measurement of heat from radioactive decay for a precise and accurate nondestructive assay of plutonium. The technique and results of measurements are presented. Requirements for Ge(Li) detectors, data acquisition and reduction systems are described."
"Four systems developed at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory for nondestructive analysis of nuclear fuel materials will be described. These systems utilize either minicomputers or a programmable calculator for measurement control and data analysis, and are typical of a variety of automated measurement systems developed for nuclear materials safeguards applications."
"An automated fuel rod scanner which uses activation by 252Cf neutrons is described. This scanner is being used to measure the uniformity of fuel loading and the total fissile content of both UO2 and mixed oxide fuel rods. Multiple detectors with high sensitivity are used to reduce the 252Cf source strength requirement. Excellent electronic stability is attained by the use of current, rather than pulse electronics. An important feature of the scanner is its on-line minicomputer, which allows a high throughput of fuel rods using a small operating staff."
"The application of nondestructive assay (NDA) instrumentation during nuclear material safeguards inspections by the USAEC Richland Operations Office (Hanford) is described. The problems and constraints of NDA instrument use are discussed from an inspector's viewpoint. New and modified NDA instrumentation is suggested which would provide improved measurement verification during safeguards inspections."
 "Digital computer systems can provide an efficient means of accessing, correlating, and displaying plant information to the operator. The careful application of human engineering techniques is required to effectively utilize this information. A total systems approach which includes the implementation of redundant sub-systems is necessary to maintain high reliability and availability. This paper describes the design of such a system."
"The standard HTGR control room arrangement is based on an extensive program that started with a study of human engineering principles and evolved with the use of a full-scale mock-up employed to arrive at an optimized control board layout and select proper components for the man-machine interface. The integrated control system makes extensive use of a dual computer as a tool for data collection, alarming, and formatting information for the operator, using cathode ray tubes (CRTs) as the prime display. Window type annunciators, recorders, and large pistol-grip switches have been replaced by multicolor CRTs, line printers, and miniature pushbutton switches designed into a compact monitoring and control console. The console is designed for stand-up and sit-down operation and is shaped for maximum operator convenience. Indicators and controls are functionally arranged so the operator can easily scan, compare like parameters, and respond to abnormal conditions. Each reactor unit of a multiunit plant is provided with dedicated instruments and controls that can be housed in separate or common control rooms as desired by the customer. The design includes modular design features for board-mounted components as well as for the control boards. This modular design provides benefits through flexibility in control room arrangement, later hardware delivery to the job site, improved structural capability, and flexibility to accommodate late changes."
"The logic diagram for an engineered safety features protection system is shown in Figure 1. The engineered safety feature system is similar for Babcock and Wilcox, Combustion Engineering, General Atomic, General Electric, and Westinghouse. As a result, the system will be used to illustrate the design considerations and techniques for meeting separation criteria for Class 1 systems. The engineered safety features system employs local coincidence logic. The system uses transmission logic, i.e., the transmission of electric power is required to initiate protective action. Transmission logic is used to prevent unwanted actuation of engineered safety features in the event of loss of electric power or safe channel failure. The system has three instrument channels for each variable. Bistable trip signals from the three instrument channels for each variable are fed to two two-of-three logic matrices; one for logic channel A and one for logic channel B. Two-of-three logic matrices are provided for each variable in both logic channels. The output of each two-of-three logic matrix is transmitted to a one-of-one logic matrix or actuator module which acts to transmit power to engineered safety feature equipment. Either output logic channel is capable of actuating the engineered safety features. In logic language, a one-of-three logic arrangement of three sets of three instrument trip signals and a one-of-one logic arrangement of two logic channels and electrical energizing signals initiate the engineered safety features actuation.1"
"The need for separation of redundant safety systems is well established; however, what constitutes an adequate separation is not. Adequate separation depends upon the nature of the hazards involved, and the vunerability of the protected equipment. This paper categorizes the most prevalent hazards and explores separations techniques, with respect to equipment vunerability, to adequately ensure safety functions."
"In a nuclear power generating station, the system used to protect the reactor and its containment is the plant protection sytem. The pressurized-water-reactor (PWR) protection systems encompass all electrical and mechanical devices and circuitry (from sensors to actuated device input terminals) involved in generating those signals associated with the protective function. These signals include actuation signals for the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and Engineered Safety Features System (ESFS) such as Safety Injection Actuation System, Containment Spray Actuation System, Main Steam Isolation System, Auxiliary Feedwater Actuation System, and Recirculation Actuation System. This paper deals with the present status and future development of the Plant Protection Systems utilized by Combustion Engineering, Inc. (C-E) and Kraftwerk Union (KWU) for their Pressurized Water Reactors. The latest techniques of signal processing, logic design, reactor trip and engineered safety features actuation circuitry, automatic testing, isolation and interfacing, are discussed. Current system design criteria, which as a result of the dynamic national and international licensing atmospheres influence system design philosophies, are highlighted."
"Prevention of or elimination of common mode failure mechanisms which may compromise the independence of redundant safety systems for nuclear power generating stations is a design objective. Within the last two years degradation of safety equipment performance due to continuous long term exposure to service environment (aging) has been identified as a potential common mode failure mechanism. Consequently placing equipment in a condition representative of advanced age as part of a type test program is now required by IEEE 323, 1974. This paper attempts to highlight some of the technology regarding placing equipment in an aged condition as well as some of the limitations of that technology as it applies to the nuclear power industry. These limitations are particularly important with regard to the extent of commitment to IEEE 323, 1974 possible by electric utilities. A variety of technical information regarding accelerated life testing of individual components appears readily available. However, considerable uncertainty in the state of the art still clouds one's ability to translate this component information into a scheme for simulating advanced age of many different components assembled into a module. Note Module is any assembly of interconnected components which constitute an identifiable device, instrument or piece of equipment. A module can be disconnected, removed as a unit and replaced with a spare. It has definable performance characteristics which permit it to be tested as a unit. May range in size from a tiny sensor to complete cabinets or racks of equipment."
 "Fort St. Vrain Unit 1, a 330-MW(e) HTGR being built by General Atomic for the Public Service Co. of Colorado, is located about 40 miles north of Denver. Construction began in 1968 and fuel was loaded under the first phase of the two-phase license in January 1974. The reactor has been critical a number of times to perform physics tests, but has been restrained until recently from producing any sensible heat by the restrictions of the second phase of the license. All prerequisites to the second and last phase of the license were satisfied on November 14 and the 40-year, full-power license went into effect. Since then, hot physics tests have been performed and feedwater has been introduced into the steam generators. All prerequisite testing is complete and feedwater chemistry is within specification for steam generator boilout. The plant is presently shut down and in a standby condition while the backup pelton wheels on the four primary helium circulators are being changed to an improved material. Upon completion of this change, now scheduled for the end of January, the rise-to-power program will begin."
 "Concepts of modern control theory and, in particular, of optimal control have been used to develop a general and systematic method of regulator design starting from the non-linear mathematical model of the plant. This method was applied to the study of the control of a nuclear reactor plant of the SGHWR type (steam generating heavy water reactor), of 105 MW electric power, working at the Atomic Energy Authority Establishment, Winfrith, Dorset, England. The optimal linear regulator, computed for the free system, is incorporated into the system with saturation limits on its control inputs. This is one reason for suboptimality. Then only measurable state variables carrying large amounts of feedback control (compared with the rest of the variables) were used on the regulator, hence the second reason for suboptimality. In the course of this work a new method of optimal linear regulator design for external disturbances was applied. It is computationally very simple and also permits a simple calculation of transients by using the same eigenvector matrix regardless of the disturbance. * Soreq Nuclear Research Centre, Yavne, Israel. ** CDC 6600 with a store of 131K of 60 bit-long"
"The damage coefficient at 298°K of copper-contaminated N+P diodes is smaller than that of non-contaminated ones. In these copper-contaminated samples,the higher the bulk resistivity is,the smaller is the damage coefficient. For non-contaminated diodes, the damage coefficient of samples of pulled bulk crystals is smaller than that of floating zone crystals, and the higher bulk resistivity diodes have smaller damage coefficient. At 217°K measurement,the effect of copper-contamination on the damage coefficient could not be observed. The energy levels of defects introduced by gamma ray irradiation are ~0.30eV, and ~0.28eV with non-contaminated FZ 135 ohm-cm and CZ 10 ohm-cm bulk samples, respectively. In copper-contaminated samples,~0.60eV and ~0.45eV are obtained as the defect energy levels for FZ 135 ohm-cm and CZ 10 ohm-cm bulk samples."
"Bulk boat grown gallium arsenide doped to 1.7 × 1016 cm-3 with silicon was irradiated with 7 MeV electrons until the sample resistivity rose to the range 106 to 108 ohm-cm. Both resistivity versus temperature and Hall-effect versus temperature data indicate the presence of an acceptor-like level at Ec - .31 eV. Carrier removal was found to be approximately 2.3 × 10-3 cm-l and annealing was found to occur near 500 K."

  "During the past 50 years, man has become acutely aware of the air pollution pervading our environment. Thus he has focused a considerable amount of scientific study on the chemical and physical properties of gaseous and particulate contaminants. A key element in the classification of particulate pollution is the sampling procedure used to collect particles, with the emphasis on separating the respirable from the non-respirable fraction. Generally, impaction techniques have been utilized for size collection of particulates, but these procedures can be affected by the nature of the impaction collection technique which can cause the particles to bounce from one stage to the next, particularly when larger sample quantities are desired for chemical analysis and gravimetrics. Recently EPA, working with several other investigators, perfected a dichotomous collection device, based on virtual impaction principles, which separates and collects particles into two size ranges, 0 to 3.5 microns and 3.5 to 20 microns. Particle bounce at the collection surface is not a problem with this sampler because particles are captured by filtration. The operation and design of manual and automated virtual impactors are discussed. In addition, the application of x-ray fluorescence to the analysis of particulates collected with the dichotomous sampler is described."
 "Methods used for determining inorganic constituents in natural waters have undergone considerable change in the last decade. A majority of metal constituents are now determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). Various chelation and extraction procedures when used with AAS have lowered the detection limits to the microgram-per-liter range for many metal constituents. Aeration techniques have been developed which utilize AAS to determine such constituents as mercury, arsenic, and selenium. Vaporization techniques using graphite furnaces and similar devices linked with atomic absorption spectrophotometers provide for still lower detection limits and greater simplicity. These vaporization procedures require more research to limit interferences before they can be widely applied to the mass analysis of natural waters. Automated equipment is routinely used to analyze water samples. Colorimetric procedures have proven most useful but several potentiometric methods have recently been developed which also adapt themselves well to an automated approach. A procedure for determining fluoride using a potentiometric method has proven especially beneficial. An atomic absorption spectrophotometer has been joined with sampler and proportioning pump modules to produce automated determinations. Further potential development of the already mentioned instrumental techniques as well as anodic stripping voltammetry, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, emission spectroscopy, neutron activation analysis, and mass spectroscopy are described."
"This paper reviews methods for sample collection and pretreatment and for isolation and determination of specific organic compounds with emphasis on methods for determination. Methods for organochlorine, organophosphorus, and organonitrogen pesticides and phenoxy acid herbicides are presented. Methods for the determination of other chlorinated organics such as polychlorinated biphenyls, organic solvents, and other selected organic compounds are also presented. Gas chromatography is the most widely applicable and popular method for detecting and measuring specific organic compounds in water, waste water, and other environmental media. When coupled with selective detectors, gas chromatography becomes the most sensitive and selective method for qualitative and quantitative determination of organic compounds that is available. The recent development and application of the computer-controlled gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer adds a much needed extra dimension to organic analysis, that of unequivocal identification of compounds that can be only tentatively identified by other means. Gas chromatographic methods are selectively applied either directly on the raw sample or after concentration by adsorption or solvent extraction and evaporation. A variety of other determinative methods such as infrared, ultraviolet, and fluorescent spectroscopy; liquid chromatography; and thin-layer chromatography have application in the broad spectrum of organic analysis. Selected examples of the application of these methods are presented."
"We review the use of drift chambers in the field of High Energy Physics: existing apparatus, plans and ... dreams. We comment especially on low cost large area drift chambers, use of pulse height information and high spatial resolution applications."
"A new method was developed for imaging spatial distributions of photons, charged particles, or neutrons over large areas by a line-scanning camera. This camera uses a linear position-sensitive proportional counter (PSPC) based on resistance-capacitance (RC) position encoding. 1-6 Applications of this camera include low-dose, medium-resolution radiography of large objects (>2 by 2 m); and, in nuclear medicine, low-dose, whole-body radionuclide imaging and radiography with low energy photons (<150keV). A prototypic camera was built and tested to scan an area of 60 by 100 cm. The spatial resolution is 1 by 1 mm fwhm for radiography with 60-keV photons and 3 by 3 mm fwhm for radionuclide imaging with 50-keV photons (limited by collimator resolution). Compared to point-by-point scanning, the line-scanning method reduces the mechanical complexity of the camera and eliminates problems encountered in construction of large-area, high pressure PSPCs. This method is superior to the area PSPC for imaging objects >60 by 60cm."
"The pulse-height spectrum of the diamond detectors irradiated with conversion electrons from 109Cd source (Eo=84keV) is calculated. The energy losses of electrons are taken into account with the help of an empirical expression that connects the range with the energy. The comparison with experimental data allowed to estimate the parameter of the detictor material, i.e. the value NS = 10-4 cm-1."

 "A brief summary is presented of the present situation in the field of energy production and consumption. Particular attention is given to areas where accelerator builders are particularly active. This will include fusion, solar energy, and energy storage and transmission. A few leaders in these fields who have been active in building or using particle accelerators will be identified. In conclusion a few problems will be mentioned which could be assisted toward solution by the talents of the accelerator fraternity."
"At many laboratories an increasing emphasis is being placed on energy-related research, often at the expense of more basic programs. The effects of this change can be clearly seen at accelerator laboratories, where tools traditionally reserved for nuclear and particle physicists are being applied in areas such as radiation damage, nuclear waste management, and materials science. The success of accelerator-based work in these fields is reflected by the increasing interest in proposals for new facilities devoted entirely to applied programs. Current proposals include various forms of intense neutron sources for fusion-related work, synchrotron x-ray sources for materials studies, and even the use of accelerators for large-scale nuclear waste disposal."
"Advances in the design and performance of electrostatic accelerators since 1969 are reviewed with special emphasis on the \"forefront\" accelerators that are currently leading in voltage capability. A comparison of the acceleration tube design offered by the National Electrostatics Corporation and the High Voltage Engineering Corporation will also be made. Other methods of increasing heavy ion energy by means of dual foil stripping will be discussed as well as the performance of a newly developed sputter ion source for the production of negative heavy ions with reliability and flexibility that greatly exceeds all other present systems. Finally, new developments in terms of both booster systems and very high voltage electrostatic accelerators (25-60 MV) are discussed."
 "Collective acceleration methods that employ an intense relativistic electron beam (IREB) are discussed. A brief history and a classification of collective acceleration methods are given. Methods examined include IREB injection into neutral gas; IREB injection into vacuum; plasma-filled IREB diodes; and vacuum-filled IREB diodes. Accelerating fields of order 106 V/cm have been observed experimentally. The collective acceleration processes for IREB injection into neutral gas and vacuum are discussed. It is noted that the collective acceleration processes for IREB diodes have not been elucidated yet. A summary of present collective ion acceleration research areas that involve IREB's is given."
 "A 3 MV, 800 kA, 24 ns electron beam accelerator is described and the results of initial switching experiments are discussed. The generator will provide a source for studying the physics of processes leading to electron beam driven, inertially confined fusion. The major components of the accelerator are two diodes with a common anode, twelve oildielectric Blumleins with low jitter (< 2 ns) multichannel switches, three intermediate storage capacitors, a trigger pulse generator and two Marx generators."
"Recent experiments indicate that synchronous untriggered multichannel switching in water will permit the development of relatively simple, ultra-low impedance, short pulse, relativistic electron beam (REB) accelerators. These experiments resulted in the delivery of a 1.5 MV, 0.75 MA, 15 ns pulse into a 2 Ω line with a current risetime of 2 x 1014 A/sec. The apparatus consisted of a 3 MV Marx generator and a series of three 112 cm wide strip water lines separated by 2 edge-plane water-gap switches. The Marx generator charged the first line in < 400 ns. The first switch then formed 5 or more channels. The second line was charged in 60 ns and broke down with 10 to 25 channels at a mean field of 1.6 MV/cm. The closure time of each spark channel along both switches was measured with a streak camera and showed low jitter. The resulting fast pulse line construction is simpler and should provide considerable cost savings from previous designs. Multiples of these low impedance lines in parallel can be employed to obtain power levels in the 1014 W range for REB fusion studies."
"The VEBA high-current, relativistic electron accelerator has been designed and constructed at NRL for application in the study of high-power microwave sources. To meet the requirements of this study, the accelerator was designed for operation in either a short (60 nsec) or long (2.2 μsec) pulse mode. The short-pulse mode has been in operation for nearly two years and has proven to be an extremely reliable design. The design of the long-pulse mode is now complete and component fabrication will soon be underway. The pulse-forming network in the short-pulse mode is an unbalanced, water Blumlein with an output impedance of 9.2μ The Blumlein is pulse charged by a 17 stage Marx generator which has a series capacitance of 29.4 nF. By transmission along a tapered coaxial line, the output pulse is transformed to 20 Ω and the voltage developed across a matched load increased to a maximum of 2.5 MV. The proposed conversion to the long-pulse mode will require that the Blumlein and transformer sections be removed and the diode assembly be attached directly to the oversized Marx tank. The direct coupling between the Marx and the Blumlein will then be replaced by two, nested, water capacitors which are shunted by spiral inductors. When coupled in series with the Marx, this output filter will form a three-section, voltage-fed, Guillemin (type A), pulse-forming network with a characteristic impedance of 40 Ω and a maximum output voltage of 0.9 MV."
"Collective acceleration of hydrogen and helium ions by relativistic electron rings has been achieved in the Garching ERA. It features fast electron ring compression and smooth magnetic expansion acceleration. Acceleration of the confined ions was demonstrated by the increase of inertia with the load of the rings and by nuclear track recording."
"The exact solution of the magnetic field produced by the pulsive current flowing in the coils placed inside the metal vacuum chamber of ERA device in IPP-Nagoya, is calculated to design the compression system of the electron ring. Actual design of the compression coils and installations of power supply systems are also described."
"The formation of rotating, relativistic electron beams with properties suitable for collective ion acceleration has been studied under a variety of experimental conditions. A straight, cylindrical, relativistic electron beam (typical energy 2-3 MeV, typical current 2-10 kA) is passed through a narrow magnetic cusp, and the resulting rotating downstream beam has been studied using a number of diagnostic techniques. Two current regimes have been investigated: one in which the self-fields of the downstream electron beam are small compared to the applied fields, and one in which the self-fields are comparable to the applied fields. The beam characteristics in both regimes have been compared to single particle expectations. Experiments have also been conducted in which the effect of an inner and outer conducting boundary on the time-resolved beam cross section has been measured. Results will be discussed in the context of collective ion acceleration experiments now in preparation."
"Numerical studies were performed to simulate the acceleration of ion-loaded electron rings by the magnetic expansion method. A finite-sized multiparticle code is used that computes particle-particle interaction forces directly and approximates conductive boundaries. Initial conditions are electron-ion rings in equilibrium, trapped in a magnetic mirror. On one side, the magnetic field is reduced in time, allowing the ion-loaded ring to move into a region of expansion acceleration. The calculations show that the use of a \"squirrel-cage\" type conductor inside the beam, which suppresses azimuthal magnetic image currents, assures sufficient axial focusing to retain the integrity of the ring."
 "Preliminary experimental results of collective ion acceleration using a linear beam from the University of Maryland Electron Ring Accelerator injector are presented. Neutron yield of 109 neutrons/pulse from Cu(p, n) Zn reactions are observed. From the Q value of the reaction, the energy of the proton must be above 4 MeV. The number of protons per pulse is estimated to exceed 1013."
"A new type of accelerator capable of producing a large flux of medium energy ions is discussed. The accelerator contains a charge neutral plasma in a magnetic field. Electron currents parallel to B→ heat the plasma electrons to an average energy kTe by the Joule process. The electrons try to escape from the plasma into an adjacent vacuum region along the magnetic field lines. In doing so they create a charge separation electric field which collectively accelerates the ions to energies ⪞10 kTe . The large resistivity necessary to obtain both the rapid heating and impedance matching to high power sources results from electron streaming instabilities in the plasma. Feasibility is investigated using a one dimensional, time dependent fluid model. In this model a realistic circuit is coupled to the plasma electrons. The resultant plasma heating and expansion are numerically followed in time and space. These calculations seem to imply that present day technology utilizing high voltage Blumlein transmission lines (Z ≃ 1Ω) seem capable of creating a 10 MeV proton stream with energy >10 kJ, and equivalent current density >10 kA/cm2"
"A transformer-charged electron beam generator has been developed. The system is designed to operate with up to 500 kV on a water-dielectric pulse-forming line (PFL) and to generate a 100 kA, 30 ns electron beam. The transformer charging supply replaces a 12-stage Marx generator and reduces the size, weight, and complexity of the system. It also eliminates the need for a large insulating-oil supply. A description of the physical features of the machine is included along with a discussion of the electrical characteristics of the system."
"Charged particle flow in planar geometry is generally classified into two phenomenological regimes. At relatively low current injection densities, less than a critical function of length and potential across the drift space and entrance kinetic energy, all charges propagate across the entire region and the flow is termed injection limited. Space charge limited flow occurs at supercritical injection densities and is characterized by partial particle reflection at the plane of minimum kinetic energy. Solutions of the laminar, monoenergetic beam equations demonstrate the existence of a transition region, rather than a single critical current density, in which either flow may exist."
"The behavior of an intense relativistic charged particle beam is studied by determining a two-dimensional equilibrium solution of the laminar flow, monoenergetic particle dynamics equations. With these relations formulated in azimuthally symmetric cylindrical coordinates, the free parameter method is used to derive the most general similarity variable nf(r,z) appropriate to the equations and an exact solution is found in terms of this unknown. The solution is interpreted as a force-free converging or diverging particle beam propagating in the z direction within a conical drift chamber."
"Recent experimental observations1 of collective ion acceleration produced when an intense relativistic electron beam was iniected into a low pressure neutral gas have firmly established a threshold beam current for the process which was predicted by Olson2; for this geometry ion acceleration does not occur unless the electron beam current (I) exceeds the space-charge limiting current (Il). In this paper we report additional observations of ion acceleration obtained in two series of experiments. In the first series, the guide tube and diode were configured to provide a large ratio of injected beam current to space charge limiting current, and drift tube endplate effects were examined. When the separation between the anode and tube endplate become less than the drift tube diameter the efficiency of the collective acceleration process is strongly reduced. In the second series of experiments the scaling of accelerated ion energy with electron beam kinetic energy was investigated using two electron beam machines which differ in stored energy by a factor of approximately 20. Using the larger machine proton energies in excess of 16.5 MeV have been attained. In addition, we also present an expression for the optimum pressure for ion acceleration in the drifting beam neutral gas geometry."
 "The problem of optimizing the effectiveness of a large scientific facility is considered in a discussion of the probabilistic, statistical, engineering, and managerial aspects of reliability."
"Control systems for large particle accelerators must be able to handle analog and digital signals and timing coordination for devices which are spread over a large physical area. Many signals must be converted and transmitted to and from a central control area during each accelerator cycle. Digital transmission is often used to combat common mode and RF interference. Most accelerators in use today have met these requirements with custom process I/O hardware, data transmission systems, and computer interfaces. In-house development of hardware and software has been a very costly and time consuming process, but due to the lack of available commercial equipment, there was often no other alternative. Today, a large portion of these development costs can be avoided. Small control computers are now available off the shelf which have extensive process control I/O hardware and software capability. Computer control should be designed into accelerator systems from the beginning, using operating systems available from manufacturer. With most of the systems programming done, the designers can begin immediately on the applications software."
"Proton beams of a few hundred million electron volts of energy are capable of inducing hundreds of curies of activity per microampere of beam intensity into the materials they intercept. This adds a new dimension to the parameters that must be considered when designing and operating a high-intensity accelerator facility. Large investments must be made in shielding. The shielding itself may become activated and require special considerations as to its composition, location, and method of handling. Equipment must be designed to withstand large radiation dosages. Items such as vacuum seals, water tubing, and electrical insulation must be fabricated from radiation-resistant materials. Methods of maintaining and replacing equipment are required that limit the radiation dosages to workers. The high-intensity facilities of LAMPF, SIN, and TRIUMF and the high-energy facility of FERMILAB have each evolved a philosophy of radiation handling that matches their particular machine and physical plant layouts. Special tooling, commercial manipulator systems, remote viewing, and other techniques of the hot cell and fission reactor realms are finding application within accelerator facilities."
 "Time-intensity modulation in beam spill can be of primary concern in some experiments. The major source of this beam structure is from main-guide field-magnet power supply ripple. If the time constants are appropriate, then final control of beam structure can be accomplished by closed loop control of the intensity of beam spill. The response characteristics of the feedback system will determine the final structure. At high beam fluxes signal to noise ratio of beam detectors, in the feedback loop, can be improved by at least four orders of magnitude by using photomultiplier tubes and a water Cerenkov counter in place of the normal secondary emission monitor. At beam fluxes below 1010 particles per second (PPS), a plastic scintillator and photomultiplier tube are used in the feedback system. A plastic scintillator and photomultiplier are also used in the beam as intensity monitors. At intensities below about 107 PPS standard counting techniques are used. For intensities between 106 to 1109 PPS, the photomultiplier is used as a current source driving an integrating circuit which is then calibrated to read the number of particles per pulse."
 "Measurements of energy spectra and percentage beam transmissions are given for an S-band linear accelerator through which the electron beam passes twice, in opposite directions. Results are presented for two magnet reflecting systems which have energy acceptance windows, ΔE/E, of 2% and 16% where E is the output beam energy after the first pass through the accelerator. For a first pass beam energy of 8 MeV the second pass energy could be varied from 3 MeV to 16 MeV by changing the separation between the accelerator and the magnet system. The corresponding full-width half-maximum energy spreads were 1.6 MeV and 0.7 MeV respectively. The system transmission was 35% first pass (unbunched injected beam) and ~ 100% second pass."
"Microprocessors (pP) are finding a growing list of applications in accelerators and associated equipment. μP's may be used as autonomous data loggers and process controllers and in distributed systems. A μP is essentially a computer CPU. Applying μP, centers around two distinct problems - completing the μP into a computer and interfacing the computer to its environment. The computer can be completed with standard computer components. CAMAC was chosen to be the interface to the environment. CAMAC has several advantages at Fermilab. It is widely used, special function modules for accelerators have already been developed, and many accelerator personnel are familiar with it. Also, it is becoming more widely accepted internationally. A brief description of the CAMAC system is given."
"The usefulness of a beam loss monitoring system in diverse aspects of accelerator operation is documented with a variety of examples."
"A high-precision calorimetric system has been developed for determining beam energy. The beam is square-wave (on-off) modulated and the time derivative of the calorimeter temperature is determined at a time late in the modulation half-cycle. This avoids sensitivity variations associated with beam size and location on the calorimeter. The data are collected and analyzed in a small on-line computer. The use of beryllium, with its very small backscatter coefficient for electrons, permits the use of the method for electron accelerators. Using such a calorimeter with a high-stability electron accelerator, standard deviations of the order of 0.03 percent for series of 20 measurements were achieved for energies from 0.025 to 1 MeV over several hours time period. The calorimeter system is usually calibrated with a low energy (~ 20 keV) positive ion beam whose energy is well established. Where lower accuracy is acceptable, the sensitivity may be determined from first principles to within 1 percent. The method will be described and the optimization of the various parameters discussed."
 "The Indiana Cyclotron control system consists of several hundred cyclotron devices and two operator stations linked to a small digital computer via a bidirectional, multiplexed digital bus. All communication between operators and the cyclotron is by means of 64 displays. Provision is made for readout, control, data logging and retrieval, alarm warning, and initiation and termination of automatic control programs. Special features of the system are the modular and dynamic master table which uniformly describes the cyclotron devices to all the programs which drive them, and the dynamically reconfigurable cyclotron control displays."
"Relevancy assumes a critical importance in control system operation because of the large amount of information available. The information deluge impacts the following areas: If information is presented at too high a rate or in too large blocks, the operators may not comprehend it. If useless data is often presented in a given display, the operators may ignore all data presented by that display. If the context of the data is not presented, the data may be meaningless to the operators. If the control and display systems are not properly designed, peaks in the message generation rate may choke the system. This paper describes the techniques in use and under development at the Clinton P. Anderson Meson Physics Facility for increasing the relevance of data both for real-time operations and for long-term analysis of accelerator performance. Data sifting and organization for presentation and for compact storage is discussed."
 "The latest addition to our distributed accelerator control and monitoring system is described which achieves parallel control of multilevel functions, multisector access as well as continuous updating of over 800 analog signals. The limitations of the preceding system are compared with the advantages of this larger network. Interface hardware and diagnostic software for the computers is also discussed."
"Thin electrostatic septa are the most critical elements of the main ring extraction system and the beam splitting stations at Fermilab. Operating experience since the first extracted beam in 1972 has indicated several improvements needed over the original septa for both extraction (single cathode) and beam splitting (double cathode). A second generation of septa, now being implemented, is described here."
"Properties of the magnetic and electrostatic elements which inflect beams into and extract from the injector and main stage cyclotrons at IUCF are described. Orbit separation is such that the assistance of orbit dynamical resonances is not employed. The beam stays in the median plane in all four systems. Inflection occurs after the beam has entered the cyclotron through one of the nearly field-free valleys; the beam crosses the central region and then experiences a bend of nearly 90° to enter the proper accelerated orbit. Extraction is accomplished by placing a substantial (~45°) bending magnet in one of the valleys just outside the region of circulating beam. Smaller elements upstream are then used to deflect the last turn so that it enters this magnet."
"The transmission line system described above will be capable of extracting the beam from the ZGS in one turn. The beam will be exiting in the vertical direction, which will be compatible with injection into the SSR. The bunch dimensions and phase space parameters are matched between the two machines so that very nearly 100% transfer is expected."
 "A beam line current and charge monitor has been in use for several months with the following characteristics: (1) beam toroid in high radiation area 200 feet from electronics, and within 30 feet of the 140, 000 ampere pulsed neutrino horn, (2) response time adequate to permit accurate (1%) measurement of 1 turn fast-extracted beam, (3) digital and analogue readouts for full scale ranges of 2 × 1012, 1 × 1013, and 5 × 1013 protons per pulse, (4) computer readout and standardization via CAMAC, (5) pulse-to-pulse repeatability is 1 in 1000 on test pulses. There is no interference from the horn, which pulses at the same time as the beam."
"The computer control system for the VICKSI-project uses CAMAC modules as the unique interface. A single loop CAMAC-Serial-Highway will control all the equipment associated with the accelerators and the beam paths. The components of the main-control-console as well as general maintenance-equipment are interfaced to the computer via a Parallel-CAMAC-Highway. No further submultiplexing is done. Special attention was given to the choice and specification of CAMAC-Modules in order to reduce the number of different types and to standardize the ports to the equipment under control. The impact on hardware (cabling, maintenance, error detection) and software design will be reviewed. The software itself is based on the use of a real-time executive in conjunction with an interpreter and a data base allowing a comprehensive addressing scheme and simple system tasks."
"Argonne's two RF deflector separated beam line has been operated in the travelling wave mode. It has produced a good yield 50% pure p- beam at 4.08 GeV/c. The operating frequency is lowered to make the phase velocity of the RF separator synchronous with the wanted particle. Results for p- beams at 2.57, 4.08 and 5.77 GeV/c are presented. In addition, the operation of the travelling wave separator in the \"nonconventional\" manner, i.e., phase velocity synchronous with unwanted particle, is described."
"Several significant superconducting beam line magnet systems are being constructed in the U.S. These will demonstrate the practicability of superconductors in beam lines. It is now time to consider some of the more subtle engineering problems associated with these magnets in order to assure a \"next generation\" of highly usable magnets. This paper presents some engineering approachs to better magnets for the future."
"During the past few years considerable experience has been gained in the operation of prototype superconducting accelerators under beam line conditions. As a result of this experience, important aspects of structure design and important questions related to the long term operation of superconducting structures have been brought into sharper focus. For applications where low power loss and high duty factor, or exceptional beam quality and stable operation, are essential properties, and where modest energy gradients can be tolerated, superconducting structures are distinctly superior to conventional room temperature structures."
"Work has been undertaken for a period of about 2-1/2 years at Fermilab on feasibility studies for the Energy Doubler/Saver. This activity has centered on the technology of building Energy Doubler/Saver magnets and their cooling system. Energy Doubling would be accomplished by installing in the 4-mile tunnel of the Fermilab accelerator a ring of superconducting magnets. Energy Saving would use the same ring of superconducting magnets operating in a power saving mode. The motivation for the saver would be to obtain the same energy, intensity and duty cycle of the present machine but with a significantly reduced electrical power bill."
 "After the life test of the two 8-cm (diameter) aperture one-meter long magnets (ISA I and II) had been satisfactorily concluded, the next logical step is the construction of a full-scale (12-cm aperture 4.25-meter long) dipole. The 12-cm magnet is essentially a larger version of ISA I and II with the exceptions of conductor and structural material refinements that have evolved in the 5 and 8-cm aperture model magnet series and comparable programs in other laboratories. The magnet windings will have a 23% higher packing density than ISA I and II. The rate of magnetic field sweep at which the magnetization of the magnet doubles, is an order of magnitude faster, due to improved conductor geometry. The peak magnetic field is approximately 5% greater than the central field 'B(0,0)' in the new design which has 85% usable aperture (≈ 67% actually required). The design field 'B(0,0)' is 4.0 T at 4.5 °K. The coil parameters are ID = 12.05 cm, OD = 15.538 cm, length = 427 cm and 80 turns/pole. The magnet is presently under construction and only prototype data and computed characteristics are presently available."
"The Energy Doubler magnet development and testing program was initiated in September 1972 and has thus far proceeded through three phases. In the first phase, several wire winding geometries and the ability to reproduce magnet field properties in a pair of dipoles were explored. This phase closed with construction and operation of a 20 foot dipole magnet. When the 20 foot magnet did not perform to expectations phase 2, a program of 2.5 foot prototype construction, was initiated. Twelve 21/2 foot magnets were tested to evaluate problems of excessive training and failure to go to short sample. Sufficient infoimation was gained about mechanical structure, wire properties and coil cooling from these studies to cause an extensive redesign of the basic Energy Doubler dipole magnet. Construction of the first magnet of new design, Cl - 2.5, in October of 1974 marked the initiation of phase 3 of our program. Three magnets have now been completed: Cl - 2.5, a 21/2 foot magnet, has gone to 40 kG mounted in a horizontal cryostat with warm iron. C2 - 2.5 has been used to explore some special concepts of coil confinement, and C2 - 10 has been tested by a 12,000 cycle test and excitation to 25 kG without iron as a demonstration of a magnet that would allow operation of the Doubler from 100 to 500 GeV in the \"Energy Saver\" mode."
"For two months, as of this writing, a 60 cm length of niobium S-band standing wave accelerator has been installed in the Cornell Electron Synchrotron. The Q0 has remained at its initial value of 1.1 × 109, and the accelerating field at breakdown has remained at 4 MeV/m. The cavity has been used to accelerate the synchrotron beam to 4 GeV by itself and to accelerate the beam to 12 GeV in concert with the normal RF system."
"The present status of the rf separator is given. Measurements of single cavity sections and of two joined sections are reported. The problem of storing heat treated sections until final assembly has been investigated. Flooding a cavity at room temperature with nitrogen deteriorates its performance, after the cavity was once excited to a peak electric field of 30 MV/m, corresponding to a peak magnetic field of 850 G and a deflecting field of 5.5 MV/m. This effect is assumed to be due to a sensibilization of the surface oxides by field emission electrons. The effect is not observed after a electric field of up to 15 MV/m and it also does not appear when the cavity is flooded with argon."
"The bunching requirements for a heavy-ion tandemlinac accelerator are defined and a bunching system to satisfy these requirenents is outlined. This discussion introduces an experimrent on the bunching of 45 MeV 16O ions by means of a λ/2 superconducting-helix resonator. The measured ion-bunch width is 64 psec, a value daminated by the resolution width of the ion detector. By correcting for the detector-resolution width one infers that the ion bunch itself is <40 psec wide."
"Superconducting niobium cavities of reentrant shape have been built and tested at Stanford. The cavities have a 35cm diameter, 10cm length, and 2cm accelerating gap. They resonate at 430 MHz. A large number of tests show that the performance of the cavities is reproducible: field strengths in excess of 12 MV/m were consistently achieved at Q values in the range 2 × 109 to greater than 1010. The highest field obtained was 17 MV/m. To obtain these performance levels, our studies show that it is necessary to use special fabrication procedures, chemical treatment, and of perhaps greater importance, ultra high vacuum firing to temperatures of 1600 to 1800°C. The geometry of the accelerating gap of the cavities in relation to the resonant frequency, make the cavities suitable for accelerating heavy ions with energies upward of 1 MeV/nucleon. A sequence of cavities could thus be used to boost the energy of particles obtained from existing tandem Van de Graaff accelerators. Compared with a superconducting helix structure, the reentrant niobium cavities have a much greater mechanical stiffness, much larger surface area for cooling, comparable or better accelerating voltage gradients, and provide a single rather than a \"double\" accelerating gap per resonator. The latter feature makes it possible to build an accelerator as a sequence of independently controlled accelerating gaps. The phase and amplitude of each gap can be adjusted to provide essentially any velocity profile for the purpose of particle acceleration."
"A system for continuously monitoring the harmonic coefficients of a superconducting accelerator is described. The method employs a series of magnetoresistance elements placed at specific locations around the circumference of the usable aperture. Difference signals from these probes are used to determine the harmonic coefficients. This method does not require integration of the field measuring signals or rotation of the probes so that the elements can be built into the magnet during construction. Experimental results are given for the simplest configuration and these results are compared to the sextupole signal measured in a more conventional way."
"The problem of dissipating the energy stored in the field of a superconducting magnet when a quench occurs has received considerable study. However, when the magnet becomes a system 4 miles in length whose normal operation is an ac mode, some re-examination of standard techniques for dissipating energy outside the magnets is in order. Data accumulated in the Fermilab Energy Doubler magnet development program shows that heating associated with the temporal and spatial development of quenches is highly localized and can result in temperatures damaging to the superconducting wire. This paper reviews the design and operation of several energy dumping schemes, compatible with the operation of ac superconducting magnets, wherein more than 70% of the stored energy can be dissipated outside the magnet. Instrumentation to detect quenches early in their development and circuits for dumping the field energy are described, and representative operating performance data for the dump circuits and data showing temporal development of quenches are presented."
"A beam line to the Multi-Particle Spectrometer capable of handling 30 GeV/c secondary beams will consist of four large identical superconducting dipoles and a number of room temperature quadrupoles. The total bending angle is 20°, 5° per magnet, and the room temperature aperture required in the dipoles is 20 cm. The four dipoles will be of the cos θ type and will have an overall length of 2.5 m and nominal maximum field of 4.0 T at 2800 A. The conductor will be a thin, wide metal-impregnated braid. The circular aperture is surrounded by coils which are a six-block approximation to a single-layer cos θ current sheet, and a coaxial cylinder of laminated iron at helium temperature. Each magnet will weigh about 10 tons. The design of the dewar including its heat load is discussed. The system is planned to be operational in Fall 1975."
"The ESCAR cryogenic system, with its two distribution loops offers many advantages. The system models the kind of system that can and should be used in future accelerators. The refrigerator cold box, with its turbine expanders, and the helium screw compressor system represent a significant step in the development of reliable helium refrigeration systems."
"As a part of a feasibility study the design and the construction of an accelerator section to be tested at the heavy ion beam of an electrostatic tandem Van de Graaff has been started. This test section consists of a cryostat with two independently phased λ/2-helix structures at 108 MHz and of a suitable rf-control system. Design criteria and recent results of measurements on a superconducting test cavity with electric surface peak fields up to 29 MV/m are presented."
"The superconducting linac of the 6 pass microtron (MUSL-1) described previously has been operated at 4.2 K for about 3 years with an energy gain of 2 MeV/meter. The duty factor has been limited to about 50% by thermal effects. A new helium liquefier supplies more than the 13 liters per hour required to operate the linac continuously at its maximum duty factor. The system can supply 5 μa of electrons with energies up to 19 MeV and has been operated on a 24 hour per day schedule for nuclear physics experiments. A larger system (MUSL-2) utilizing a surplus 3 MeV Van de Graaff as an injector and a 6 meter superconducting accelerator section made for us at Stanford University is being assembled in another area. Although the installation is not yet complete microwave tests indicate that the section can be operated continuously with an energy gain of 13 MeV with an input power of about 10 watts. For the initial operation of MUSL-2 the 6 pass hardware from MUSL-1 will be used to recirculate the electron beam through the new linac section to a final energy of 60 MeV."
"A new heavy ion accelerating structure has been developed which together with a parallel development in chemical polishing techniques makes possible very high accelerating fields for a wide range of particle velocities using inexpensive and easily handled materials. This \"Split Ring\" accelerating structure has a peak magnetic field approximately one third that of other inductively loaded accelerating structures (less than 10OG at 1MV/m accelerating field) and a peak electric field less than 6 times the effective accelerating field. In addition, a chemical polishing technique appropriate for use on electroplated lead surfaces has been developed which greatly reduces the electric field emission of electrons from the surface. Surface fields greater than 25MV/m have been obtained in superconducting resonators with polished lead surfaces with no detectable loss due to field emission. Using these techniques, we have achieved an accelerating field greater than 4 MV/m in a superconducting structure and have begun long term tests. Preliminary results indicate no surface degradation at high fields (> 3MV/m) for relatively long times (14 hours)."
 "We discuss the design and layout of the refrigeration, transfer, and magnet systems. We also present data on heat leaks and beam losses."
"An H-magnet with no median plane symmetry, in which all the current carrying coils lie below the median plane, has been studied using the GRACY magnet program. This magnet was suggested by A. vanSteenbergen and has several possible advantages for use in a super-conducting storage accelerator. The field multipoles violating median plane symmetry were found to be small, and correctable with small correction coils. In addition, it was found possible to reduce these undesired multipoles considerably by shaping the iron pole face."
"Two different techniques were used for short sample tests of superconducting wires. One method was done with a DC transformer and the other with a high current DC power supply. Three different types of sample holders were used for the latter. Their relative merits and demerits are compared. Many wire designs representing half a dozen companies have been tested, and their results are presented. For the short sample test, quench current and current at various resistivities was determined. Resistivity ratios of ρ300/ρ12 were found for copper, and the effect of cola work on these ratios was investigated."
"This paper reports on a preliminary theoretical study of the interaction of electromagnetic fields in the accelerating structure of a racetrack microtron with the transverse motion of electrons circulating through the structure. Basic equations of the transverse beam dynamics and of buildup of the deflecting modes are derived with the help of idealized models of a microtron as well as of the beam-structure interaction process. The dependence of the starting current for beam blowup -(BBU) on the parameters of the accelerator has been studied and some features of the Microtron Using a Superconducting Electron Linac (MUSL-2) of the University of Illinois were taken into account to make numerical calculations. It was shown that the starting current is extremely sensitive to the phase correlation between the returning beams and under some conditions can be much lower than that for a linac. The use of the thin magnetic lenses on each orbit helps to achieve higher values of the starting current."
"The fabrication, processing, and measurement of two S-band niobium prototype electron accelerator structures are discussed. Maximum surface magnetic fields were typically between 250 and 550 Oe, corresponding to average energy gradients between 4.6 and 6.5 MeV/m, with Q0 values typically greater than 5 × 109. The structures which were electropolished gave more reproducible results than those which were chemically polished."
"The photo-production facility at Fermilab utilizes a two section liquid deuterium attenuator, 103 feet in length, to reduce the neutron flux and produce a pure high energy photon beam. The facility is located in the Proton East experimental hall. The facility also includes nine 10 foot long sweeping magnets. A unique refrigeration system supplies mechanically refrigerated helium gas trace cooling to condense deuterium directly in a flask. The control system permits remote operation of the cryogenic system and also acts as an interface to the Proton Area operations computer. The computer can be used to monitor the operating parameters and for partial control of the system. The facility is presently in use as part of the Proton Area experimental program."
"Magnetic field computations have been performed for a four-inch coil aperture 45 kG dipole magnet that may be utilized in a high-field option of POPAE. A cold iron version utilizing flat pancake coils has been explored to determine the magnetostatic effectiveness of a simple coil geometry. Suitable locations have been found for rectangular blocks of conductors each consisting of 280 turns of .040 in by .040 in conductor."
"Magnetic field computations have been performed for the three-inch circular aperture doubler magnets in the warm iron geometry. Locations for rectangular conductors along circular arcs have been found such that, in the absence of the construction errors, the sextupole and decapole terms have been removed from the dipole. For the quadrupole suitable locations for the conductors have been found that remove the duodecapole term. Field quality, longitudinally integrated fields, construction errors, forces, energy content, and eddy current heating under cycled conditions will be discussed for a 45 kG dipole and a 20 kG/inch quadrupole."
  "Current practical applications of small accelerators are summarized. These include: trace element studies with both neutron activation analysis and charged particle induced x-rays, accelerator produced neutron well logging techniques, and accelerator-based research associated with the controlled thermonuclear research program. A rather extensive bibliography is included in all three areas."
"The two 4000A, 150V power supplies for the spectrometer magnet of the Bates Linac have a current regulation and stability of better than .001% for an 8-hour period. Current sensing is accomplished by a 5-volt precision shunt. The output is programmed by a stable dc voltage reference with a 6-digit keyboard. The rate of current increase or decrease for controlling magnet excitation is adjustable up to a rate of 4000A per minute. Power dissipation in the 300 pass transistors of each supply is limited by automatically controlling the emitter to collector voltage with the use of a variable voltage transformer. To avoid possible conducted or radiated interference with experimental signals, no silicon-controlled rectifiers are used. The major portion of this article is devoted to an analysis of the stability."
"The Fermilab Booster synchrotron requires precise injection and extraction field regulation (±0.001% repeatability). To achieve this tolerance with a current regulator requires that the current measuring device have a high degree of resolution, stability, and a high output level. To meet this criteria, a transductor using the second-harmonic magnetic modulator technique was chosen. This device is capable of better than ±0.001% measurements from dc to 15 Hz for currents from 50 to 1200 A. Small signal (~100 A peak-to-peak) response is 3 dB down at 10 KHz. The conversion gain was chosen as 1 V/121.25 A to permit operational amplifier compatible signal levels at the output."
   "The 125 kW CW klystrons to be described in the first part of this paper were specifically designed for energy upgrading of the electron-positron storage ring, SPEAR II, at SLAC. Four tubes are required with an efficiency greater than 50 percent. The operating frequency is 358.54 MHz. The gain is approximately 50 dB, the operating voltage is 41 kV and the microperveance is 0.7. The klystron must be stable when working into an accelerator cavity VSWR as high as 2:1 at any phase angle. The calculated and experimental data to be presented include saturation and phase characteristics. A maximum efficiency of 57 percent was obtained and the highest output power was 160 kW CW at 42.5 kV. The second part of this paper deals with the design of a higher power version of this tube. The RF power is 500 kW CW at an efficiency exceeding 70 percent. The operating voltage and current are 62 kV and 11. 5 A, respectively. The higher efficiency is obtained by inserting an additional cavity to make use of second harmonic bunching. Eighteen such klystrons are to be used in the proposed PEP storage ring."
  "The ability of synchrotrons to accelerate particles with different e/m0 values is dependent upon being able to control its accelerating-voltage frequency as a function of the actual guide field value. Interpolation between modification values can be performed to reduce the possibility of exciting phase oscillation. Differences between the desired frequency and the actual frequency produced (due to non-linearities in the system) are also removed with the digital processor increasing the precision of the system up to two orders of magnitude. Successful operation with six different particles has been demonstrated."
   "Transductors are used as current measuring devices in the main accelerator quadrupole power supply feedback loop and as monitors in the dipole circuit. The development of these transductors is described, starting with the basic series - connected (Kraemer) transductor circuit, and adding the features of biasing and a voltage follower to obtain improved linearity and high slewing rate."
  "For the injection of heavy, multiply charged ions into accelerators or for injection of cluster ions into fusion reactors, physicists require high-voltage dc power supplies with voltages in the range of 0.5 to 3 MV and currents of the order of several hundred milliamperes, and even amperes. Several power supplies in this range have been built recently, some for particle injectors and some for testing UHV dc transmission line components. In 1974, high-voltage dc power supplies with the following output ratings were completed: 2.5 MV/200 mA, 2.2 MV/ 200 mA, 1.2 MV/100 mA, and 1.0 MV/120 mA. All power supplies are built according to the symmetrical Cockcroft-Walton generator principle and are either air-insulated open structures or built into a pressure vessel and insulated with high-pressure sulphur hexafluoride. Based upon theoretical considerations and experience gained with units previously built, it appears feasible to design even more powerful generators."
"To meet the particular requirements of heavy-ion injection into large accelerators, a new model dc power supply was developed and built. A pair of 320 kV dc injector power supplies was installed in 1973 at the \"Gesellschaft fuer Schwerionenforschung\" (GSI) near Darmstadt, Germany. These power supplies deliver an electronically regulated preaccelerating voltage for both dc and pulsed modes of operation. An improved bouncer system is utilized to keep the output voltage constant at pulsed operation. Furthermore, a new analog-digital voltage-regulating device is incorporated into the control facility. The 320 kV injector system has been in operation for more than a year, and performance has been completely satisfactory."
"The RF window vacuum seals on the 400-GeV Fermilab accelerating RF cavities are very large circular cylinders of alumina. The cavities were first installed with seals of 94% purity Al2O3. Several of these seals failed in high-power operation due to dielectric heating. Higher purity ceramics (99.5% Al2O3) have been obtained and are now being installed. The complex permitivity of both types of ceramic has been measured in a TM010 mode test cavity ten-inches high and eight feet in diameter. Frequency shift and Q shift data have been analyzed by perturbation analysis and by computer programs. Results confirm that the higher purity ceramics have a loss tangent a factor of five better than the original seals. Some high-power operational test results are also presented."
 "The salient features of a new high power linear accelerator system are described. This machine combines a 300 kV dc accelerator, constructed for operation with pulsed currents in excess of 2A, with a single section 10 MeV accelerator waveguide so that given levels of high peak current may be maintained over a wide range of beam energies. (Previous technology required RF phase and/or power adjustment to a second accelerator section.) The accelerator waveguide incorporates a suppressed phase oscillation buncher designed so that a loss of terminal electric field strength, caused by a large reduction of input RF power to reduce beam energy, may be accurately compensated by an increase in potential of the dc accelerator, thus maintaining the capture efficiency of the waveguide. Reduction of space charge forces due to HV injection, and avoidance of dual section operation, prove to be major operational advantages. The 20 MW RF transmitter and the overall beam centerline are described; and operating performance and equipment photographs are presented."
"A 16 μH, 6 Ωm septum magnet load must be pulsed while extracting beam from the 200 MeV booster of the Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS). A power supply was designed for this purpose that can deliver ~ 2 ms wide, half sine wave pulses with a PRF of 30 pulses per second. The peak current is adjustable from 3 kA to 10 kA and repeatable within ± 0.05% by means of a novel charging circuit. By providing a transformer between the magnet and the capacitor bank, the overall cost of the system was reduced to less than onehalf of that of a conventional capacitor discharge system. A high-Q choke shunts the negative half wave of the current around the transformer, thereby extending the life expectancy of the magnet and increasing the circuit efficiency."
"The power supply system for steering the Bates Linac beam provides continuous adjustment of the current from + 2.5A to -2.5A per pair of coils at ±25 volts. A simple, inexpensive system has been assembled from off-shelf components. Separate controls for 26 pairs of coils are provided by means of power operational amplifiers and drivers connected in series with the coils across a common pair of ±30V busses. No current regulation is used. After coils and amplifiers have reached thermal equilibrium (about one-half hour at 2.5A) the current is stable within 0.5%."
"Pulsed operation of six extraction magnets has saved $67, 000 in FY 75. Conversion of four six-phase supplies involved some unique analog circuitry. A minicomputer operated function generator provides control of up to 20 magnet power supplies with new dI/dt data available every 4 ms. The operator control console has several options which appreciably decrease set up time and decrease operator error."
   "A description of the design and performance of a 20 MeV, side-coupled, S-Band Standing Waveguide for electron acceleration is given. Performance data pertinent to the application of this accelerator to cancer therapy Is given and discussed."
"Since the first beams were accelerated in 1972, the RF system has performed very satisfactorily. In particular, the simple air-cooled design of the cavity and final amplifier has proved to be very trouble free in operation. As the bean intensities gradually reached and then exceeded the design value of 2.5 × 1012 protons per ring, a number of improvements were introduced to cope with the increased beam loading and to permit the special beam gymnastics that have been found useful at the highest intensities. Modifications include: i) provision for reducing the Q of the cavity during trapping; ii) an improved system for synchronizing the four rings prior to ejection; iii) measures taken to control longitudinal instabilities; iv) safety precautions to protect the cavity and amplifier against transients."
"Rectangular drift tube-loaded cavity resonators which were operated in the TE 101 mode have been tested for their use in a phase-free accelerator. Perturbing object measurements combined with numerical calculations show that the energy gain depends strongly on the shape of the drift tubes and on the position of the beams in the reference plane. Particles are accelerated in one direction within a range of about 10 cm using 25 cm wide drift tubes with straight and pointed shapes, respectively. The energy gain of one cavity has been measured directly at an electromagnetic field amplitude of 1.6 Gauss and an electron beam of 20 keV. The time averaged energy gai-n of 15 eV is in good agreement with the theory. An example of an accelerating device which might be used to produce a large circulating current of electrons of 50 MeV is sketched. The cavities are placed within the gaps of spiral ridge magnets."
"Accelerator operation during the first year of scheduled beam to physics experiments is described. Some details of the gun, RF, water, vacuum, control and monitoring systems are reviewed with reference to performance and reliability."
"Calculations of fields in standing wave accelerators operating in the 2Π/ 3 and Π/ 2 modes have been done using a set of RLC coupled loop circuits to determine equilibrium current solutions. These results have been compared to experimental on-axis field measurements in an S-band accelerating structure. Tolerances of the two systems to frequency and coupling-constant differences are discussed as well as to operation slightly off-resonance. All results indicate that the Π/2 mode is significantly less sensitive to construction and operational differences."
 "A variety of electron gun systems in the 200 to 500 kV range have been placed into linac service during the past five years. These systems were specifically developed to improve the reliability and performance of high power linear accelerators by providing low emittance pulsed electron beams having highly stable flat-top characteristics. Lifetimes considerably in excesss of 5000 hours have been achieved through the use of low heater power dispenser cathodes, non-intercepting electrodes for control of beam emission and focusing, all-metal and ceramic high temperature brazed dc accelerating columns, and operational vacuum levels of 10-7 to 10-8 Torr. The design features and performance of several of these systems, including short beam pulse and high duty factor are discussed, and typical beam waveforms and equipment photographs are presented."
"During 1974, the period covered by this report, the ISR were in operation for 3500 h, of which 80% were for physics runs and their preparation. 20 physics experiments took data at six of the beam intersections. Ten of these experiments were completed. Several new ones will start this year, after the annual shut-down ending March 1st. Again six intersections will be used for physics, including one (I 7) that has now been equipped with a high luminosity insertion. Operational performance throughout the year has profited from the regular application of the methods developed at the end of 1973, viz. gradual compensation of the space-charge tune shift during stacking followed by fine tune corrections with the help of Schottky diagnostics Circulating currents above 15 A and luminosities around 5 × 1030 cm30 s-1 became routine performance, while the beams remained confined to the space of the tune diagram marked 8C in Fig. 1. This space is free of non-linear resonances below the order 8. In addition, a further improvement of the pressure to values well below 10-11 torr average around the two rings, has led to improved clearing of ionization electrons. As a result, decay rates as low as 3 × 10-5 fractional loss of current per hour have often been observed. More than half of this decay is due to beam-beam collisions, the rest to nuclear collisions with the residual gas. These conditions permitted running at the highest luminosity while all experiments could take data, undisturbed by excessive background."
"The double storage ring DORIS has been in operation since the beginning of 1974. Colliding beam experiments started in November of 1974. Luminosities of 1030cm-2s-1 at 2 GeV are routinely reached during experimental runs. Beam life times are 8 to 11 hours. At the present time luminosity is limited by phase instabilities."
"The single beam and colliding beam performance of the SLAC electron-positron storage ring SPEAR II is described. The sevenfold increase in harmonic number in SPEAR II in comparison to SPEAR I has made significant changes in single beam behavior. Strong synchrobetatron resonances and a new transverse instability are observed and our first studies of these phenomena are described, Measurements on current dependent bunch lengthening are presented."
"In order to simulate the beam-beam effect in a proton storage ring, at values of the beam-beam tune-shift much higher than those attainable with proton beams in the ISR, a non-linear lens has been installed. It consists of a pair of bars inside the vacuum chamber, about 1 m long and capable of carrying currents pp to 1000 A, corresponding to a linear tune-shift of about 0.1. The current bars, running parallel to the beam at a distance of a few mn above and below it, create a highly non-uniform magnetic field. It has the same symmetry as space charge at a head-on intersection, and excites all nonlinear resonances nhQh + nvQv = p for which both nh and nv are even. The beam decay rate has been measured as a function of the betatron tunes and the tune shift ΔQ caused by the non-ljnear lens. When ΔQ changes between 0 and 0.05 the decay rate changes by about 3 orders of magnitude, and depends strongly on the betatron tunes. A computer simulation shows that at ΔQ ≈ 0.05 the stochtsticity limit is reached."
"A proposal for the construction of a 19 GeV electron-positron storage ring at DESY has been submitted for approval. The circumference of the ring will be 2304m, the bending radius in the magnets 197m, the maximum luminosity 1.2x 1032cm-2s-1. PETER will make use of the storage ring DORIS as an intermediate storage facility during injection and the 7 GeV-DESY synchrotron as the injector."
"The experimental results relating to the beam-beam interaction in electron storage rings and the ISR (p-p collisions) are considered. The question of whether or not stochasticity is implied by these results is discussed. It is argued that all the available evidence on the beam-beam limit is not inconsistent within an isolated resonance framework. A model which qualitatively fits the observations, one which is derived from classical resonance theory, is proposed."
 "The development of meson factories is briefly summarized. Present facilities are described and compared with the design goals they set out to meet. Further developments and limitations are discussed."
"The 590 MeV isochronous ring cyclotron produced its first extracted proton beam in January 1974. One year later the situation is as follows: Two external targets with a total of six secondary pion beam lines and one neutron line are operational and a number of experiments with medium energy pions have been performed. The superconducting muon channel is operating successfully and produces the highest muon fluxes ever recorded. Transmission through the ring cyclotron is more than 95%. Typical currents on the targets are 5 μA, the maximum being 25 μA."
"An extracted beam at the design energy of 500 MeV was obtained at TRIUMF in December, 1974. Later, beams of varying energies between 180 and 520 MeV were extracted down beam line 4 and further work resulted in the simultaneous extraction of a 506 MeV beam down beam line 1 while variable energy beams were brought down line 4. In order to reduce initial activation of cyclotron components, time average beams have been restricted to 100 nA but 12 μA in a pulsed beam was very easily obtained at 500 MeV. Without much optimization of the injection conditions and without use of the harmonic trim coils an energy spread (full width) of 2.5-3.0 MeV has been observed. Ordinarily, the macro-duty factor has been 100% and the micro-duty factor corresponds to a 5 ns pulse every 44 ns. The transmission to 500 MeV is consistent with the expected loss due to gas stripping."
"The full energy beam with vertical width 0.25 in. and projected intensity 12 W.A is a major step toward fulfilling the design goals (20 W.A) of the accelerator. We anticipate that an increase in intensity by a factor of 2 will be obtained by extending our injection time from 10 W±s (at present) to 25 μs. By varying the timing of the source trigger, we have verified that this time window is indeed available for injection. This injection time extension will require modifying the ion source pulser. We also expect to be able to extract higher ion currents by modifying the source tip to bring the plasma closer to the extraction hole. Calculations on the operation of the extraction system indicate that we should be able to exceed 75% extraction efficiency with the vertical and radial widths measured. The adiabatic turn-off of the RF voltage, with concurrent compression of energy spread, has not yet been tested, but we expect that it will improve the extraction efficiency. We are presently installing the extraction system, and anticipate extracting beam in April 1975."
"POPAE (Protons on Protons and Electrons) is a storage ring facility at the Fermilab on a scale suitable to permit the collision of 1000 GeV protons with 1000 GeV protons and with electrons of an energy compatible with that scale. In this paper, we summarize our work thus far on the lattice and layout of the proton storage rings. Though the 1000 GeV physical scale is maintained, the design is developed in a 400 GeV context. The proton rings form a racetrack, the two long straight sections of which are each about 1 km in length. Each long straight section contains a number of matched lattice insertions, as well as uncommitted space for additional development. Depending on the assumptions made concerning the beam-beam limit (as yet unknown experimentally), maximum luminosities are calculated to be in the range from 1033 to 1034cm-2 sec-1."
"The growth of proton beams coasting for a long time with very low loss-rate has been measured. A comparison with the growth-rate expected from intrabeam scattering is presented. At lower energy measured and calculated growth agree. At higher energy the measured growth tends to exceed the calculated one by about a factor of 3. The growth in momentum spread is in accordance with theory."
"One of the means proposed to increase the luminosity in storage rings, a so-called low-ß insertion, has been put successfully into operation in the Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR). By installing five quadrupoles in each ring around one intersection, a reduction of beam height by a factor 2.3 has been measured, and, with proper matching, the perturbation to the rest of the machine was found to be negligible. With circulating beams of 20 A and 24 A a luminosity of 2.11 x 1031 cm-2s-1 has been achieved. This paper reports the results of tests conducted, compares them with the theoretical forecasts, and gives a short description of the hardware used."
"A system to transport 10-to-15-GeV electron and positron beams from the Stanford Linear Accelerator and to inject them into the PEP storage ring under a wide variety of lattice configurations has been designed. Optically, the transport line consists of three 360° phase-shift sections of FODO lattice, with bending magnets interspersed in such a way as to provide achromaticity, convenience in energy and emittance definition, and independent tuning of the various optical parameters for matching into the ring. The last 360° of phase shift has 88 milliradians of bend in a vertical plane and deposits the beam at the injection septum via a Lambertson magnet. Injection is accomplished by launching the beam with several centimeters of radial betatron amplitude in a fast bump provided by a triad of pulsed kicker magnets. Radiation damping reduces the collective amplitude quickly enough to allow injection at a high repetition rate."
"The requirement of high periodicity (even periodicity two) in a storage-ring lattice imposes a strong restriction on the number and type of insertions that can be included. On the other hand, since the insertions are matched only at one momentum, the ß-function error for an off-momentum orbit is generally greater In a one-period lattice. This large ß-error has several undesirable effects. All of these undesirable effects can be compensated or greatly reduced by judicious arrangement of betatron phasing and by the use of trim sextupoles. The design procedure and the resultant performance will be demonstrated for a model one-period lattice."
  "Consideration of a national program for the development of new high energy facilities during the next ten years suggests that the most appropriate energy for proton storage rings may be higher than the 200 × 200 GeV of the present ISABELLE design. It has been indicated that 300 × 300 GeV or 400 × 400 GeV may provide a more reasonable step to maximize the scientific potential of the next major proton storage ring facility. A preliminary analysis of the design consequences of changing the ISABELLE energy to 300 × 300 GeV and 400 × 400 GeV is given, keeping the luminosity, maximum field and most of the original design parameters unchanged. It is concluded that the ISABELLE concept can be extrapolated to 400 × 400 GeV without any unmanageable technical problems and that even higher energies seem to be feasible."
"The status of EPIC, a 14 GeV electron-positron storage ring which it is proposed should be built at the Rutherford Laboratory, is given. Changes from the Proposal2 are described, especially the characteristics of the booster injector and methods of forming bunches in the main ring. The R & D programme on the components for the machine is also outlined."
"It is shown how a single beam space charge force can combine with a lattice design having large ß variations, such as occurs in machines with low ß insertions, to induce resonance behavior. Although the single beam space charge force may be highly nonlinear, it will, by itself, excite no resonances, since its azimuthal Fourier decomposition is essentially composed of 0th harmonic. However, low periodicity, large ß variations are harmonically rich and can provide the necessary azimuthal harmonics for resonance excitation. The resonance characteristics of this type of system are developed. A strength parameter involving the linear tune shift and the ßmax value is introduced. In particular, two cases are discussed: (1) where the force arises from the beam self-field and (2) where the force is induced by images in the surrounding boundaries. A comparison is made with the beam-beam force in terms of both the strength parameters (related to the linear tune shifts), and the nonlinear resonance behavior."
  "In the electron-and positron rings of DORIS strong transverse and longitudinal single beam instabilities were observed, which caused current limitations. The severest transverse and longitudinal instabilities were induced by excitation of higher modes in the rf-cavities. When these instabilities were cured by damping the higher cavity modes, the thresholds for this type of instabilities were greatly increased. The origin of the remaining transverse and longitudinal instabilities is not yet understood. The thresholds of these instabilities were increased by Landau-damping and changing the betatron- and synchrotron frequencies from bunch to bunch. The head-tail effect was observed at high peak currents and was cured by compensating the chromaticity. In the electron ring a transverse instability is present which is induced by the ions. Ion clearing in combination with some vacuum improvements is sufficient to avoid this instability."
"Computer control systems have been in use on operating accelerators for several years. This paper discusses and gives examples of ways in which the capability of the control-system equipment can be used by accelerator engineers and physicists to study beam properties and operating characteristics of accelerator components."
 "A system for controlling vertical single bunch instability is described. The vertical position of each of the 1,113 bunches in the Fermilab Main Ring is digitized and stored in a memory. After an interval determined by counting RF cycles, the memory is read. The delayed position signal is sent to a distributed amplifier. A transmission line serves as a beam deflector."
  "A new high-intensity K-beam has been installed at the Bevatron. The design goal was 2.2 x 105 K+ s per machine pulse at 500 MeV/c, 7.4 × 104 stopped K+ s, and less than 106π contamination. Large horizontal acceptance (± 210 mrad), short length (~ 10 m) and two stages of separation are the most prominent features of the design. The observed optical properties are in reasonable agreement with the calculations. An evaluation of the performance of this beam is presented."
 "In storage rings employing superconducting magnets, the use of a cold bore as a cryopump appears, at first glance, as simple and economical. Since the selection of a cold or warm vacuum system has far-reaching implications on the basic design, we consider each system in some detail. The theoretical and practical limitations imposed on the maximum beam current by the gas desorption from the chamber walls are discussed. A realistic design of a cold vacuum chamber is developed and then compared with the proposed warm ISABELLE vacuum system. The comparison shows that the warm approach is preferable."
"ESCAR is an experimental superconducting accelerating and storage ring for protons. Scattering collisions with residual gas degrades the quality of proton beams that are stored for long time periods. The loss of quality will be small if the average gas density in the path of the beam is kept less than about 106 molecules per cm3, depending upon the gas species. This density corresponds to a room temperature pressure for nitrogen-like gases of 3×10-ll Torr. We plan to achieve this vacuum goal in the ESCAR ring by distributed cryopumping at 4.5°K, the operating temperature of the superconducting magnets. In the magnet sections the cold bore of the magnet will provide the condensing surface. In the straight sections, 4.5°K beam tube or distributed cryopumps will be provided consistent with the function of the particular section. The large cryosurface area provides effective pumping capacity for H2 by utilizing sub-monolayer adsorption. The surfaces can be degassed of H2 by a temperature rise to 15°K. The cycle can be accomplished during routine maintenance periods. We expect the interval between the degassing of the magnet quadrants to be of the order of months. Because of the experimental nature of ESCAR, sector valves will be provided to permit the isolation of each straight section from the ring to allow ready accessibility for equipment testing and modification. Each section will have a roughing and conditioning pumping station."
"With its high peak currents, SPEAR II is likely to show transverse coherent oscillations. A closed loop system using the beams as a signal path detects the bunches' center-of-mass motion and reacts on the beams after one machine period with a set of traveling wave electrodes. The detector senses oscillations at the betatron frequency and rejects signals due to equilibrium orbit shifts. The amplifier output is solely determined by the desired gain and the detector noise. Since, for a given machine tune, the system's phase margin can be made 90° by selecting the respective location of the pickup and feedback electrodes, stability is secured for all values of gain. However, one shows that critical damping cannot be obtained except with infinite gain, and that the system's damping rate is strictly equal to the gain per turn. Measurements of the loop gain have been carried out and agree with the observed damping. To date the system has been successful in dealing with injection oscillations and headtail instabilities."
"A non-intercepting, charge-sensitive, sampling beam probe has been developed for use in internal beam phase measurements in the variable-energy, separated sector injector cyclotron at Indiana University. The two probe pickup plates of 10mm by 16mm are located above and below the median plane with sampling diodes in close proximity. The probe head is mounted on a movable assembly permitting continuous observation of phase history from inflection radius through extraction radius, at interval beam currents of 100 nanoamperes or greater with pulse rise times of less than one nanosecond. Over a two-year period the phase probe has proved relatively reliable and easy to use for confirming trim coil adjustments and orbit dynamical isochronization procedures. The probe display, in addition to providing data on phase group width and centroid versus radius, has on occasion shown up ion source ripple and radio frequency parasitic generation which might otherwise have been overlooked."
 "The beam position system of the Fermilab Main Ring contains one horizontal and one vertical Electrostatic Beam Pickup in each of the 96 cells of the machine. A pair of 75 ohm cables transmits the induced signal from the machine tunnel to the nearest service building. In each of the 24 service buildings, there is a solid-state multiplexer and a beam position detector which processes the A-B signal pairs to produce an intensity-normalized voltage proportional to beam displacement. This voltage is digitized, read into buffer of the Lockheed MAC A, and in turn transferred to the Xerox 530. Horizontal or vertical orbits can be obtained ih 50 millisec. Orbits are obtained at injection, and at a Main Ring Sample time, if requested, anywhere on the acceleration cycle. Injection orbits can be flattened automatically by a program that sets dipole trim magnets."
"A technique is described for in-situ calibration of the beam-spill control system at LAMPF. Radiation produced by intercepted beam at the wire scanners is employed as a test source. It is shown that the secondary emission current from the wire scanner is a useful measure of the intercepted beam. The wire scanners are inserted into the beam by a digital-data servo system until the desired level of radiation is produced. Interesting digital-data servo-loop responses are displayed. The entire calibration procedure is programmed by the accelerator control computer and can be repeated as often as required without turning off the beam. The calibration programs have been written so that the conditions of the detectors and signal cables are determined and recorded."
 "A pulsed beam chopper has been designed and tested for use on the 750 keV proton injector transport l ine of LAMPF. The deflection structure, which is 1 m long, is similar to the traveling wave beam deflector in a high speed oscilloscope. The proton beam travels between two deflection \"plates\" each consisting of the closely spaced turns of a helical delay line. A 5 ns long positive pulse on one helix with a simultaneous negative pulse on the other helix creates a transverse electric field in the beam region which travels with the beam. The longitudinal velocity of the electric field is matched to the proton beam velocity (~1 cm/ns) by the pitch of the helices. This scheme allows the 5 ns (5 cm) long \"micropulses\" of LAMPF to be chopped into or out of the linac with 1 ns transition times. This method avoids the constraints of resonant chopping systems and will permit completely arbitrary patterns of LAMPF micropulses to be selected and accelerated. One exotic application is the generation of pseudorandom pulse sequences for neutron time-of-flight measurements."
"The Bevalac consists of, in part, a 200 meter long transfer line between the SuperHILAC and the Bevatron, which are at differing elevation. Unique features in the construction of the transfer line are described. The line, located largely outside, must cope with a natural environment. Part of the line passes through a hillside, requiring some unique support and alignment techniques. The dipoles are of the tape-wound variety and the steering magnets use printed circuit conductors. The vacuum system and an inexpensive and effective destructive monitoring sysstem are described."
 "The positioning tolerances of magnets are an important consideration in the design and installation of a beam line. A misaligned magnet can both shift the beam centroid and affect the beam line transmission characteristics. To first order and without misalignments, the coordinates at any point of a beam particle are given as a transfer matrix times the initial coordinates. To this we add a term linear in the misalignment parameters giving the beam centroid shift, and a term bilinear in the initial particle coordinates and the misalignment parameters giving the effect on the beam focal properties. This formalism has been incorporated into the computer program TRANSPORT. The effect of either a known misalignment or an uncertainty in position may be exhibited. In a single run, up to ten magnets may be separately misaligned, and their separate effects on the beam coordinates printed in a table."
"The vacuum system for PEP will be similar in design, construction and operation to the system currently in operation at SPEAR. There will, of course, be quantitative differences since the closed path of PEP will be 10 times longer than the SPEAR path. Some qualitative differences will also arise since the radiated synchrotron power for PEP will be about 13 times greater than for SPEAR giving rise to an increased linear power density incident on the chamber wall. Other differences arise from the higher energy spectrum of the synchrotron radiation. The SPEAR vacuum system has been in operation since April 1972 and has proven satisfactory in design, construction and operation. The chamber has been subject to synchrotron radiation for approximately 300 ampere-hours and the beam lifetimes are now more than several hours. The details of the PEP design and the SPEAR operating experience will be further discussed in this paper."
"Previously reported measurements of heavy ion beam attenuation with pressure have demonstrated the need for additional pumping in the circulating beam region of the Oak Ridge Isochronous Cyclotron (ORIC). Two specially designed 20°K cryopumps, located on the magnet poles, have increased the pumping speed in the circulating beam region by about a factor of 3. This has led to increased intensity for beams of heavy ions of elements that can be condensed by the cryopumps (e. g., oxygen, nitrogen, etc.). The improved vacuum has led to an increased understanding of a beam loss in the internal region of the cyclotron. Measured cross sections for beam loss and the cross section energy dependence have been determined."
"Pulse magnets were built utilizing tape wound cores in order to lower magnet power requirements at high pulse repetition rates and high gap flux densities. The primary reason this project was undertaken was to bend higher energy beams with existing power supplies. A decrease in the amount of electrical steel from 2720 kg for the original laminated core pulse magnet design to 260 kg and the elimination of the ceramic vacuum chamber resulted in substantial savings. Two new magnets are now operational with the capability of deflecting 40 to 50 GeV/c beams through ± 0.35° (6.13 mrad) at a PRR = 360 pps. The old magnets with the same power supplies could only bend 21 GeV/c beams through the same angle. Principal features of this design, including test data, are presented."
"Th optical transitionradiatio emitted by electron irradiated aluminum, silver, gold-coated plates and self-supported metallic and mylar films has been investigated experimental ly using 450 incident electron beams with intensities°from 100 pA up to 10 , A, and energies from 35 up to 72 MeV. Beam dignostics (intensity, profile, centering, energy) were made using an ppropriae optical rrangment together with a two-parallel foilsdevice in which the interference phenomena in transiti. on radiation emitted at both interfaces was exploited. The intensity of light integrated in a small aperture at the center of the interference pattern presents a strong particle-energy dependence(of the form. sE8) which was used in the optimization of the p~a8e adjustment of the electron bunches in the linac at small current intensities. Moreover, study of the visibility of fringes yields to an estimate of the transverse mo-mentum spread of the electron beam and to he r. m. s. angle of multiple scattering in a given mteial."
"Commercially available thermoluminescent material, CaSO4: Mn incorporated in Teflon tape, is used in a phosphoresecence decay mode to measure beam profiles. The light image resulting from radiation exposure is scanned by a microscope-photomultiplier system having a spatial resolution of 0.25 mm. Several applications to various types of accelerator beams are presented."
"Horizontal and vertical integrated beam-current profiles are generated by a system of multi-wire chambers (32 wires/profile) operating in either the ionization or proportional mode. Sixteen distinct displays (1024 words) are digitally stored and any four may be simultaneously displayed. A new display can be generated at 64 ms intervals. A central control unit selects the mode of operation, the amount of delay after an appropriate trigger, the chamber integration time, and the particular chambers to be displayed. Operating in the proportional mode relativistic heavyion beam intensities as low as 104 charges cm-2 sec-1 can be detected."
"A ferrite electron beam current monitor has been developed for use with the NBS Linac. This monitor is useful at the fast rise times (< 5 ns) needed for the short pulsing of the linac and also gives good flat top response for the long pulse (up to 5 μs) work. The low frequency response is achieved by using ferrite with a large μ (= 5000) and a large number of turns (100). At the higher frequencies the core plays a very small role and the structure acts as an air core transformer. The main difficulty observed with other types of ferrite transformer monitors has been ringing due to coil resonances, making these transformers unsuitable for use with fast rise times. This ringing has been eliminated by the placement of damping resistors around the coil and tying them to a common but independent annular ring adjacent to the coil."
 "Instrumentation and control (I&C) for the Los Alamos Clinton P. Anderson Meson Physics Facility (LAMPF) main beam line is based upon central computer control through remote stations which provide input and output to most devices. Operating experience shows that the ability of the computer to give high-quality graphical presentation of the measurements enhances operator performance and instrument usefulness. Experience also shows that operator efficiency degrades rapidly with increasing instrument response time, that is, with increasing delay between the time a control is changed and the result can be observed. For this reason, instrumentation upgrade includes speeding up data acquisition and display times to under 10 s. Similarly, television-viewed phosphors are being retained where possible since their instantaneous response is very useful. Other upgrading of the instrumentation system is planned to improve data accuracy, reliability, redundancy, and instrument radiation tolerance. Past experience is being applied in adding or relocating devices to simplify tuning procedures."
 "A 53 MHz random triggered recycling, predetermined start-stop scaler is described. The scaler has a range from 2-to-9999 counts, sensitivity of 40 mV rms and provides both NIM and TTL standard logic outputs. The scaler is composed mainly of standard ECL integrated circuits including universal counters, configured in a \"synchronous parallel carry\" connection, and ordinary logic gates and flip-flops. Special circuitry has been designed to prevent start-up counting errors due to the phase randomness between the applied start triggering and input signal transitions. Following a start trigger, the scaler cycles until disabled, delivering an output pulse each time the predetermined count is reached. The time jitter of the output pulses with respect to the periodic input signal is less than 0.1 ns. High resolution examination of the behavior of individual charge bunches within the accelerator is made possible when the scaler is set to count the machine's harmonic number. If the scaler is set one digit away from the harmonic number, the output pulses advance one bunch for each turn around the machine, allowing a sequential display of the contents of each bucket in the machine."
"A beam signal processor is used to secure the position of each charged bunch in the Fermilab main synchrotron. The signal processor operates at 317 MHz, 6 times the fundamental beam component and utilizes an amplitude-to-phase converter/hard limiter combination to obtain a normalized position signal. The normalization process is complete in less than 10 ns and is effective over a 23 dB intensity range. The methods used to sample and process the 2 ns beam signal are discussed and the principle parameters of the device listed. The processor outputs the derived position data to elements in a closed-loop beam damping system."
 "Two intersections of the CERN ISR have recently been equipped with beam scrapers. Controlled by computer, they permit the vertical profile of the circulating current intensity to be plotted automatically, so that the position of the centre of a beam can then be determined to within 10 microns. This has been used to calibrate the beam displacements used in the standard \"Van der Meer\" type luminosity measurements while the particle density profiles allow a direct evaluation of the luminosity. A description of the mechanism and the computer control system is given and some results are discussed."
 "The Los Alamos Clinton P. Anderson Meson Physics Facility (LAMPF) high-energy pion beam (P3) is a three-bend channel with two achromatic output legs designed for high-intensity and moderate resolution. The best resolution was measured to be 0.2% in Δp/ p. A phase space of about 25 π mr-cm is transmitted by the channel. A π+ flux of 2 × 107 pions/s was measured for 300 MeV/c momentum when a 7 μA proton beam struck a 6 cm graphite target. Proton contamination for good quality π+ beams up to 450 MeV is negligible when an energy degrader (graphite) is used to separate protons from pions. In actual operation, very little beam tuning is required. Focusing elements are set according to the TRANSPORT computer code. Additional rate and contamination data will be presented, as well as additional information gained from operating experience."
"The transfer beamline between the injector stage and main stage cyclotrons has been designed, constructed and is under test. The beamline provides a good match between the calculated extracted phase space ellipses in the injector and the inflection requirements of the main stage over a wide range of particle types, emittances and energies. Energy dispersion of 0.07% FwHM for 16 MeV protons is available at a waist. Attempts were made to minimlize time dispersion; as a result the time spread through te transfer system is negligible for light ions. For 12C(14+) the time spread will cause an energy spread in the main stage at 200 N4eV of about 100 KeV, under normal operating conditions."
"The design features of the elements of the ESCAR (Experimental Superconducting Accelerator Ring) injection beam line are described. The junction of the proton transport system with the ESCAR injection straight section requires the design of mechanical elements compatible with the 10-11 torr vacuum requirements of the main ring. These elements include a novel septum magnet whose salient design features include a current-carrying septum of tapered thickness, to reduce the overall power requirements, and total enclosure of the magnet coil in a metal can for vacuum compatibility. Other elements are a wire electro-static septum, and several fast-rise \"bump magnets\". A transition cryopump is designed to seperate the main ring vacuum from the relatively poor 10-6 torr vacuum of the conventional beam transport line. A brief description of the conventional beam transport line from the 50 MeV proton linac, recently installed for Bevatron injection, is also included."
"This paper describes the vacuum system for the beam-transport lines used with the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory 100-MeV electron-positron linear accelerator. It is operated in the high (10-4 to 10-5 Pa) range using standard ion pumps with turbomolecular pumps for roughdown. This paper also reviews the important factors considered during the initial design phases; these factors have contributed to the very reliable performance of the vacuum system since its startup five years ago. The cleaning and handling procedures used on the beam-transport lines, magnet vacuum chambers, and other vacuum components are discussed."
 "A new method of producing single fine structure pulses of electrons is presented. A prebuncher operating at a whole number fraction of the fundamental (3/4, 5/6 etc.) is used. Electrons will only be accepted when the prebuncher is in phase with the buncher which occurs at the beat frequency. Stray electrons preclude the use of this simple system in a high current Linac but use of a wide band travelling wave prebuncher powered at the fundamental and beating frequency simultaneously produces even better results. Detailed calculations to predict the performance of the system are presented."
"There are five major heavy-ion centers constructed or funded worldwide; two additional centers are on the verge of being funded. Additionally, there are numerous smaller installations producing excellent science. Most installations aim at 10 MeV/u for the higher mass particles, and as high as possible for lighter ions. Berkeley and Dubna have reached or plan to reach relativistic energies for heavy ions. Studies and proposals for additional relativistic heavy-ion faccilities are pursued at least in five places. Altogether a very large effort is under way which is bound to leave a deep impression on basic science in the decade to come. There is an obvious energy gap in proposed facilities; namely, 30 - 150 MeV/u for high-mass particles. It is apparent that we should be searching for inexpensive magnets for high Bp in circular machines, or for very high, inexpensive electric gradients in linacs. This picture could be dramatically changed with a real breakthrough in ion source development. At least we should satisfy ourselves that we understand ion sources to the extent that we can predict their ultimate performance; only then can we produce optimum accelerator system designs."
"This paper is intended to survey recent developments in ion sources, particularly work reported at the \"Symposium on Ion Sources and the Formation of Ion Beams\" held in Berkeley in October 1974. The approach here will be to subdivide this topic into three main areas; briefly list and discuss notable progress in each; and finally add some additional detail through a few specific, selected examples. The major items of progress discussed include development of large-area plasma surfaces for multiple-aperture ion sources, a significant increase in available negative-ion current densities, and improved general agreement between extraction electrode design and performance."
"A PIG discharge with radial extraction and a separate sputtering cathode placed opposite to the outlet has been built. To increase the yield of negatively sputtered ions, cesium is vapourized into the discharge. Magnetically analyzed spectra of the extracted beams prove, together with other evidence, that the extracted ions are those directly sputtered. Among others, the following analyzed beams have been obtained: C- - 7 μA, F- - 15 μA, Al- - 1 μA Al-2 - 2.0 μA, Cl- - 30 μA, Ta- -3 μA, and Au- - 59 μA. With 10 μA injected into our tandem accelerator, a 2.4 μA Au++ beam was obtained."
"An EBIS (Electron Beam Ion Source) is presently being constructed for use on the Texas A&M cyclotron as an external heavy ion source. This description of the source, which is nearing completion, includes the essential elements, the operating conditions, expected output, and results of initial tests on some of the components."
 "The heavy ion accelerator combination VICKSI being built at the Hahn-Meitner-Institute in Berlin consists of a 6-MV Van de Graaff accelerator as injector into a 4 sector cyclotron with a mass energy product of 100. The primary design aim of this accelerator combination is 200 MeV for Carbon to Argon ions. The Van de Graaff including ion source and high voltage terminal is undergoing major reconstruction. The beam matching and transport system between the two accelerators comprising a stripper and two bunchers has been designed. The components for this system have been or will be ordered until March 1975. The cyclotron is being built by Scanditronix/Sweden. The four sector magnets will be assembled at Scanditronix for final shimming and field mapping. The RF-system is under test with low power. The new building for the cyclotron is completed except for interior work. The anticipated date for first beam injection into the cyclotron is November 1976."
"A detailed study of an isochronous cyclotron as an energy booster accelerator for the Chalk River 13 MV MP Tandem Van de Graaff has been undertaken. The cyclotron is intended primarily for heavy ions but would accelerate all ions from Li+3 to U+33 to at least 10 MeV/u. NbTi superconducting coils supplemented with cylindrical iron poles provide an average magnetic field of ~ 5T out to the extraction radius (0.65 m). Four saturated iron sectors with spiral edges provide focussing. Bunched ions are injected from the Tandem into the cyclotron midplane and stripped at the innermost orbit. An eight gap spiral edged rf structure provides 0.6 - 0.8 MV of accelerating voltage per turn. Electrostatic deflection initiates single turn extraction of the beam."
"Under the control of the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) and of the National Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics (I N2 P3) a multi accelerator system for heavy ions is beeing studied. The heart of this system consists of two identical conventionnal separated-sector cyclotrons K = 400 (SSC 1 and SSC 2); at the output of SSC 1 ions are stripped through a foil, high charge is selected and injected into SSC 2. The injection into SSC 1 will be achieved by a small compact cyclotron or by an 1 MV electrostatic accelerator. As the required beam must be intense and precise (energy resolution and emittance) special attention has been paid for a careful matching of the three stages of acceleration in transversal and longitudinal planes taking into account space charge forces as well as electric and magnetic defects. A set of parameters for the two main machines and their injectors is given."
"Construction of a 25 MV tandem electrostatic accelerator is now planned as part of a new heavy-ion facility at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The design of this accelerator incorporates several unusual features. The most important of these are a folded design, in which the low-energy and high-energy acceleration tubes are contained within a single column structure, and a digital control system. Motivations for these design features are discussed in conjunction with a brief description of the accelerator."
"The Argonne FN tandem now uses Pelletron chains for its charging system and a closed corona system for the voltage distribution along the column. This change has improved the stability of machine operation significantly. The maximum voltage on the terminal is now 9.8 MV compared to 8.6 MV attainable previously in normal operation. The voltage fluctuations in the terminal have decreased by an order of magnitude."
"During the 2nd Symposium on Ion Sources and Formation of Ion Beams, we reported on the development of our Mk II pulsed double slit magnetron source for the production of negative hydrogen ions.1 The source was capable of yielding beam currents up to 125 milliamperes, corresponding to current densities of 1.25 A/cm2. In order to increase negative hydrogen beam intensities by an order of magnitude (this would be quite useful for initial high energy neutral injector systems on Tokamaks), a larger, Mk III magnetron has been constructed, with the number of slits increased up to six. The idea was to utilize in a more efficient way the plasma width. In addition, such a source geometry will be more adaptable for beam formation and acceleration than single slit structures. With three extraction slits, we obtained a negative hydrogen yield of 300 mA with current densities of 1.2 A/cm2; preliminary results with six extraction slits showed beam currents in excess of half an ampere with averaged current densities in excess of 0.75 A/cm2."
"The operational reliability required of an H- source for direct or booster injection into a proton synchrotron has been demonstrated during several recent tests of Booster I, the developmental booster for the Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS); the minimum pulsed design current of 4 mA at 50 MeV was obtained for the first time during a recent test of direct H- injection into the ZGS. On the basis of these results and anticipated further improvements in the source, preparations are being made for the permanent installation of a stripper in the ZGS for the conversion of H- to H+. Direct H- injection will become the normal mode of operation, with the 50 MeV beam going to the booster and ZING, an intense neutron generator, in the interval between ZGS pulses. The planned effort through July 31, 1975, calls for an operational tandem-acceleration sequential charge exchange source yielding a 50 MeV H- current of ~ 8 mA. In this source, a low density hydrogen target will serve as a space charge neutralizer and a buffer between the positive ion source and a sodium-vapor charge exchange cell receiving the H+, H0, and H- output from the hydrogen cell. This effort will require a relatively small and conservative extrapolation within the confines of the present state of the art."
"A rotatable cold cathode Penning ion source has been designed and is now operating in the Oak Ridge Isochronous Cyclotron (ORIC). Previous sources for positive heavy ions have been severely limited in life-time by cathode sputtering and buildup of sputtered cathode material. The new ion source extends the cathode lifetime by a factor of ~ 6. The source cathodes are discs of tantalum, 7/8 in. in diameter and 3/8 in. thick. Upon completion of an ion source \"burn\" at one position on the circular edge of the cathode discs, each disc is rotated to an unused position for the next \"burn.\" Provision exists for continuous rotation of the cathodes. The plasma collimating holes, where the sputtered cathode tantalum is deposited, also are on discs with six possible positions. The new source has resulted in increased accelerated beam currents and greater stability for heavy ions. The source has also been used to produce light ion beams (H, D, α) over a wide range of intensities."
"The performance of the Bevalac is reported. The Bevalac uses the LBL SuperHILAC as the heavy ion injector to the Bevatron. Ion species up to 40A have been accelerated to energies of 1.9 GeV/A at modest intensity. Neon has been accelerated to 2.1 GeV/A at an intensity of 4·1010 particles per pulse. The modifications to the SuperHILAC and Bevatron are briefly reviewed and the computer control system is described. Results of the first phase of operation and plans for further improvements are reported."
"An accelerator for multiply charged ions with a terminal voltage of 320 kV has been developed. A pulsed cold cathode P.I.G. ion source with titanium cathodes and side extraction is immersed in a magnetic field, to analyze and focus the beam into the entrance aperture of the post accelerating column. Matrix calculations of the ion optics are given. After the accelerator the beam can be focussed with an electrostatic triplet into a gascell. The charge exchanged beam is analyzed in a magnet provided with several exit gates for the respective charge states."
"The energy of heavy ion beams from the 25 MV \"folded\" tandem now being acquired will be increased by additional acceleration in the Oak Ridge Isochronous Cyclotron (ORIC). Beams of ions up to A = 160, with energy sufficient to overcome the Coulomb barrier on lead, will be produced. The beams will enter the cyclotron through the dee stem, be directed by a magnet through the fringe and main fields to a stripping foil which lies on the appropriate orbit for acceleration. A stripping foil holder, an injection magnet, and beam transport elements will be required in addition to modifications of the ORIC rf system. Central ray data for several beams are presented. An analysis of the effects of finite beam size and emittance are presented elsewhere in these proceedings."
"The present calculational results are part of a continuing study to assist in optimizing the geometry and flexibility of the ORIC injection system. The calculated effects of finite emittance and dee-gap crossings during ion injection on beam size and quality at the stripper foil are presented."
"Absolute yields of charge states resulting from the scattering of 20 MeV Fe and I ions were determined over the range of scattering angles 0° to 1.5°. Measurements were made over the pressure range of 10-3 to 1 Torr as measured in a 2 cm long differentially pumped cell, corresponding to the transition region for nonequilibrium to equilibrium final charge state distributions. The final charge state yields were found to be independent of the initial charge state of the ion species. The relatively large integrated yields make the technique attractive for possible use as a terminal stripper in large tandem accelerators."
"Recent theoretical work speculates on the existence of abnormal states of matter which could possibly be created as a result of collisions of superenergetic heavy nuclei. For this reason the possibility of acceleration of heavy ions with mass number A > 200 to kinetic energies of 1 < Tn < 10 GeV/nucleon has been studied and found to be feasible without modification of the AGS vacuum and rf systems by using a fast cycling synchrotron as a booster ring. This booster is required in order to obtain the fully stripped ion state, since partially stripped heavy ion acceleration in a slow rise time accelerator is impractical because of extreme vacuum requirements. The fast cycling feature of the booster is essential in reducing transmission losses associated with electron capture or loss during acceleration and beneficial in increasing the final beam intensity."
"We have previously described a system for boosting the energy of heavy ions in isochronous cyclotrons by recycling. This system requires simultaneous acceleration of two beams on different harmonics, all-magnetic extraction, external separation, and reinjection of the lower energy beam. The first three requirements have now been demonstrated on a limited scale using simultaneous beams from an internal ion source, and without building a reinjection system. A 6Lil+ beam on the third harmonic at an energy of 4 MeV and a 6Li3+ beam on the fundamental at an energy of 36 MeV were simultaneously accelerated on the Oak Ridge Isochronous Cyclotron (ORIC), extracted and separated, demonstrating the major principles of recycle without closing the loop."
"Studies of beam transport through the planned ORNL 25 MV folded tandem accelerator demonstrate efficient utilization of phase-space acceptance and the feasibility of injecting buched beams from the tandem accelerator into the Oak Ridge Isochronous Cyclotron (ORIC). Use of a 180° bending magnet in the terminal provides outstanding charge state selection and permits better control of the high-energy beam transport than has previously been possible in coventional tandem acceler ators. Time spreads introduced in bunched beams by the 180° magnet are kept within a 6° RF acceptance window at ORIC provided the beam has a crossover in the center of the 180° magnet. Ion masses from 12 to 240 amu, preinjection energies from 150 to 500 keV and terminal voltages from 7.5 to 25 MV were studied for dc beams and beams bunched by various modulation techniques."
"The comparison of pulsed vs. dc arc operation for nitrogen and argon shows a shift in charge distribution toward the higher charge states for the pulsed case. Tests with various magnetic field shapes along the arc column show a significant increase in high charge state output for a uniform field compared to the case with a field low at the cathodes."
"The present TRIUMF injection system consists of a 12 keV Ehlers type unpolarized H- ion source located in a 288 keV accelerator terminal, and connected to the cyclotron by a 35 m long injection line which contains two 90 deg electrostatic bends, three periodic quadrupole sections, and elements to pulse, bunch and chop the beam. The stray magnetic field from the cyclotron has been compensated in the source and along the beam line with passive shielding and ferrite permanent dipoles. The beam enters the cyclotron axially and is bent into the median plane by means of a spiral inflector. This system is now being commissioned and currents of 50 μA dc and 250 μA peak in a pulsed mode have been obtained with 90% transmission. Currents of 500 μA dc and a bunched beam of 1.5 mA peak have been obtained previously in the prototype injection system, and similar performance can be expected with the present system. A polarized H- source is under construction."
 "A Penning type ion source with axial extraction has been installed in the 7-MV Van de Graaff for the production of heavy ions. The source test in the accelerator and beam parameter measurements (currents with emittance and energy spread) proved the source to be adequate for the accelerator combination VICKSI."
"The ANL polarized proton ion source has been operating for almost two years. In that time, the improvements and modifications discussed here have increased the peak current by a factor of 3 and the polarization to 75 to 80%. The beam stability and, spin reversal are no longer problems, and the maintenance requirements have been significantly reduced. Some further increases in the output current of the source may be possible. Adding up all of the current gains discussed above and applying them to a well-tuned source with a clean, efficient dissociator tube; beam currents of 50-60 μA may be possible. A new RF amplifier and a higher voltage electron gun in the ionizer may allow currents in the 75 iA range. However, beam currents beyond this level will probably require a radically new approach to the design of atomic beam sources."
"The matching system connects the Van de Graaff preaccelerator with the isochrounous split pole cyclotron of the heavy ion accelerator combination VICKSI and prepares the beam for injection into the cyclotron. The charge state of the ions is increased by a stripper (gas or carbon foil). This however enlarges the phase space occupied by the beam due to angle- and energy straggling. To minimize this deterioration of beam quality a sharp focus at the stripper is provided in all three dimensions. A longitudinal (time) focus both at the stripper and in the center of the cyclotron is achieved by means of two identical clystron-type bunchers. The magnetic focusing system between the two bunchers contains two doubly achromatic bending units of 90 degrees. Telescopic focusing is used onto the stripper and from the stripper to the second buncher. The last section just before the cyclotron comprises one more bending unit and several quadrupoles for dispersion matching and adapting the horizontal and vertical phase space for injection."
"Recently a new type of accelerator tube,1 made entirely of ceramic and metal and containing no organic material, was installed in the Argonne 4-MV Dynamitron.2 Instead of being cantilevered from the base of the accelerator as was the old tube, the new tube is suspended from the main frame by a set of compact springs of unique design. Consequently, the main frame had to be strengthened against sidewise sway. The new structural members also markedly increased the shear strength of the frame. Previously ion-source assemblies were mounted directly on and their weight supported by the accelerator tube. Now the weight of each source is carried by the terminal frame, and provisions have been made for aligning each source to the tube. To provide space for a new source assembly which incorporates mass analysis, various electronic circuits within the terminal were relocated and the terminal wiring was rerouted. The accelerator has performed well since the modifications."
"New belt charge regulators have been installed on the CN and EN Van de Graaff accelerators at ORNL which allow considerably more flexible control of the belt charging current than did the original circuits. Aside from the series regulator tube all components are now solid state. Control of the series regulator (at high voltage) is achieved through optical coupling."
"A heavy ions facility for CYCLONE (Belgium) is described. It consists of an injector cyclotron, able to accelerate heavy ions to a K value of 70 MeV Q2/A, with an upgrading possibility of 100 MeV Q2/A. Expected intensities are large. Some design aspects are described, allowing the cost of the project to be quite low."
 "There is currently high interest in the use of accelerators to study irradiation effects in materials to be used in reactors. The effects produced by heavy ion irradiation (e.g., nickel ions irradiating stainless steel) and fast neutron irradiation are qualitatively similar. Time to achieve the damage state characteristic of end-of-life service is hours as compared to several years in available reactors. Some of the successes in this area are described herein as well as some of the many problems to be solved in order to establish quantitative relationships."
"Protons have a well defined range in matter. A detector, therefore, placed near the end of range of a monoenergetic proton beam becomes a very sensitive measure of changes in the mass of material which the beam has traversed. This property of protons can be exploited in a variety of ways to make radiographs of solid objects. The experimental radiography system we have built to use with the 200 MeV booster synchrotron of the Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS) is described. In addition, there is a brief description of a more elegant system which would operate with a suitable source such as the proton diagnostic accelerator proposed by R. Martin."
"High energy (fast) alpha particles can be used for nondestructive radiography of the human body because small electron density changes are reflected in measurable alpha particle energy changes. Using high resolution radiation detectors and computer techniques for transaxial reconstruction, it is possible to present information that is not available from conventional radiographs with doses one-tenth that required for photon scanning procedures incorporated in the EMI or similar scanners."
"Recent advances in linear accelerator technology point to the feasibility of designing and developing practical medical linacs for producing protons, neutrons, or pi mesons for the radiation therapy of cancer. Additional uses of such linacs could include radioisotope production and charged particle radiography. For widespread utilization medical linacs must exhibit reasonable cost, compactness, reliability, and simplicity of operation. Possible extensions of current accelerator technology which might provide these characteristics are discussed in connection with linac design, fabrication techniques, materials, power sources, injectors, and particle collection and delivery systems. Parameters for a medical proton linac for producing pions are listed."
"Measured characteristics of both the extracted beam and the beam within the accelerator are given for a racetrack microtron with a three-cavity accelerating structure. Final beam energies of 9 to 15 MeV with currents up to 30 mA have been achieved by passing the beam six times through the cavities and beam energies of 4.5 to 7.5 MeV with currents up to 60 mA have been obtained after three traversals of the cavities. An improved injection system and magnetic guide field design are described, and the suitability of this type of machine for radiation therapy is considered."
"Intense ion beams of short duration can be created by charge exchange injection into a number of small, high field storage rings. If the beams are extracted and focussed from many directions simultaneously onto a DT pellet, a beam of protons or a particles of 15,000-30,000 A for a duration of 1-2 ns can result. Such beams have possibilities for compressing and heating to fusion temperatures submillimeter pellets of a DT mixture. The potential of this method is discussed."
"An electron storage ring to be used solely as a synchrotron radiation source has been designed for a maximum energy of 1.5 GeV, expandable to 2 GeV, and a maximum current of 1 A, High field superconducting magnet wigglers to serve as hard radiation ports have been incorporated into the ring to make available a wide range of wavelengths for simultaneous experiments. The regular lattice consists of a series of small achromatic bends forming the arcs. The wiggler magnets are placed in low-ß in the center of insertions separating these arcs. The arrangement minimizes the electron emittances and yields high source brightness. Other machine parameters are dictated by experimental requirements and apparatus as well as by cost constraints."
"A pulsed neutron source has been designed for materials research in slow neutron scattering and radiation effects. The facility is based in its first phase on the ZGS 500 MeV Injector Booster Accelerator, which will produce 5 × 1012 protons per pulse and be modified for 60 Hz operation. In its second phase a high intensity synchrotron will provide 5 × 1013 protons per pulse at 60 Hz at 600-800 MeV. Neutrons are produced by spallat ion in two targets. A 238U target surrounded by three hydrogeneous moderators provides 12 neutron beams for slow neutron spectrometers. Peak thermal neutron fluxes of 1.5 × 1015 and 1016 n/cm2 sec will be available in Phases I and II, respectively. Such pulsed beams will provide new capabilities for neutron scattering research, especially in the use of neutrons with energies up to 1 eV, which is beyond the capacity of the most advanced research reactors. A separate tungsten target for radiation effects studies provides fast neutrons (around 1 MeV) in 10 irradiation thimbles, with time-average fluxes around 3 × 1013 and 3 x 1014 n/cm2 sec in Phases I and II, respectively. The associated γ-ray flux is extremely low."
 "In this paper we show that the neutron spectrum from high-energy deuteron bombardment of a thick Li target is suitable for simulation of radiation effects in a fusion reactor. Neutron spectra from 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35-MeV deuterons incident, respectively, on a 2-cm thick Li target are reported. For these spectra, a recently-developed computer code was used to evaluate damage-energy cross sections, primary recoil energy distributions, and spectrum-averaged reaction cross sections in several metals. The results indicate that a (d,n) source can simulate the energy dependence of the recoil spectra, and the rate of helium production anticipated in a real fusion reactor"
"The muonic x ray spectrum resulting from negative muons stopping in tissue samples and tissue \"equivalent\" materials has been obtained. Relative muonic x ray intensities have been determined and an attempt made to correlate these intensities with atomic abundances in these materials. A comparison of the results for the various targets is presented. Limits of sensitivity for fluorine and calcium in these biological materials have been established. Results are outlined which demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining data in the singles mode, that is, without a muon telescope. This will allow one in the future to use the higher muon beam intensities which will be available at LAMPF. In addition, the use of larger targets will be possible and the possibility of using focusing collimators to interrogate a specimen is likely."
"Results are presented from the tuning of the first section of the Biomedical Channel at LAMPF; the work centers about the use of the third bending magnet as a magnetic spectrometer. The momentum resolution at the intermediate focus is given in detail. The performance of a wedge degrader that compresses the wide momentum acceptance of the first section is discussed. The output π- rate is also given."
 "The Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Project (SSRP) is now in full operation as a national facility utilizing the intense ultraviolet and x-radiation from the storage ring SPEAR at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). The experimenter-operated facility is designed to maximize access to, and utilization of the radiation by 5 or more simultaneous users, within the limits of parasitic operation on a high energy colliding beam storage ring. A novel experimenter-controlled personnel protection system permits independent access to each of 5 experimental areas. A vacuum monitoring and control system protects the storage ring vacuum from contamination, rising pressure, or catastrophic failure. The design and operation characteristics of these control systems and of the beam position monitoring and control system, vacuum system and thin beryllium windows are presented."
"It has been demonstrated that intense sub-microsecond bursts of energetic electrons cause significant pulverization and surface spalling of a variety of rock types. The spall debris generally consists of sand, dust, and small flakes. If carried out at rapid repetition rate this can lead to a promising technique for increasing the speed and reducing the cost of underground excavation of tunnels, mines, and storage spaces. The conceptual design features of a Pulsed Electron Tunnel Excavator capable of tunneling approximately ten times faster than conventional drill/blast methods is presented."
"The advantage of proton radiography for early cancer detection in soft human tissue has been demonstrated. 1-4 In order for this technique to become a practical medical tool for early detection of cancer, however, a proton source suitable for use in hospitals and clinics is required. An initial concept of such an accelerator has been discussed.5 It would meet the requirements considerably better than any existing accelerator and be simple, reliable, and economical."
"A discussion on target configuration and negative pion yield, supported by high power electron beam experimental data, establishes 250-330 kW at 500 MeV to be desirable beam parameters for an electron linac which, in combination with a Stanford carrousel type pion spectrometer, would provide a practical source of π- mesons suitable for radiotherapy applications. A preliminary analysis confirms that peak current limitations imposed by cumulative beam breakup may be avoided by adopting specific microwave design procedures, which minimize higher order mode transverse shunt impedances in potentially troublesome zones of individual waveguides, and which introduce higher order mode stop bands at specific locations along the beam centerline, similar to the techniques used for the MIT and IKO high duty factor linacs."
"The design of a 4 × 1012 s-1 source of 14 MeV neutrons is described. The neutrons are produced by the T(d, n)4He reaction using a 25 mA, 300 kev beam of atomic deuterons bombarding a water-cooled, rotating drumshaped titanium-tritide target. The drum dimensions are chosen to give at least a 100-hour half-life for the neutron source strength."
"Prospects for pulsed electrical power output from a MHD self-excited accelerator driven generator is investigated. Feasibility is centered on exploring the magnitude of acceleration and energy conversion ratio in the accelerator channel subject to a spectrum of applied current impulses. Plasma conditions of moderate and high degree of ionizations are studied."
"The Science Research Council has approved plans for building a 2 GeV electron storage ring at the Daresbury Laboratory specifically for producing beams of synchrotron radiation and so provide a continuing research facility when the electron synchrotron, NINA, is phased out. The initial objective will be to achieve the maximum current obtainable (0.37 A) using a single 250 kW, 500 MHz klystron to provide the RF power. This will produce high fluxes of photons down to 1 Å, initially along three beam lines feeding six experiments. User requirements have dominated the design considerations. Later developments proposed include the addition of a second klystron which will allow the beam current to be increased to 1 A and also provide excess power to supply the additional requirements when special superconducting 'wiggler' magnets are installed to extend the usable wavelength range down to O.1 A. The number of beam lines is expected to increase to about ten."
"Recently built electron storage rings provide very high transverse electron densities in their low-ß insertions. This suggests the feasibility of laser action of an electron storage ring at optical and even shorter wavelengths. Using a semiclassical theory of induced synchrotron radiation1, it is shown that special bending devices should in fact allow for light amplification in this spectral range. The special bending unit should be an electrostatic deflector providing an intense electric field of Coulomb type. Lower wavelength limits for laser action are estimated using reported or design performances of SPEAR I and DORIS. For the latter machine this limit is of the order of 3000 Å, provided that an electric field strength of 10 kV/cm could be achieved and the deflector is placed in a low-6 insertion."
   "The energy loss due to the excitation of parasitic modes in the SPEAR II rf cavities and vacuum chamber components has been measured by observing the shift in synchronous phase angle as a function of circulating beam current and accelerating cavity voltage. The resulting parasitic mode loss resistance is 5 MΩ at a bunch length of 6.5 cm. The loss resistance varies with bunch length σz approximately as exp(-0.3 σz). If the measured result is compared with reasonable theoretical predictions, we infer that the major portion of the parasitic loss takes place in ring vacuum components rather than in the rf cavities."
 "The bunch formation produces generally an oscillatory time-behaviour of the longitudinal charge density, which is reproduced synchronously in the coherent self-field. The resulting beam behaviour, caused by the space-charge feedback, tends to convert single-peaked bunches into double-peaked ones (as seen on a sum pick-up electrode). It is analysed with the energy spread of the unbunched beam, the beam intensity, and the particle distribution as parameters. For given values of these parameters a theoretical shape of the RF voltage rise V(t) is then obtained by successive approximation, which minimizes bunch shape oscillations without reducing the high trapping efficiency (> 90%). This V(t) (one to five per cent of Vmax for t = 0) imposes operation under very heavy beam-loading conditions. Experimental results, obtained after the corresponding improvement of the systems performance, are presented and compared with the bunch shapes obtained, for equal trapping efficiencies, with an iso-adiabatic voltage rise."
"When the working point (νx, νy) lies near the intersection of two sum resonances that arise from the same nonlinear multipole field, the width of each resonance is modified by the presence of the other. Taking the two third-integer resonances 3νX= N and νX+ 2νy= N as an example, we have developed an analytical treatment of this problem and its predictions have been compared with numerical results."
"The main problems encountered on the way to 1013 ppp have been emittance blow-up and coherent instabilities. The observations and counter measures are described in the text."
"At beam intensities greater than 8 × 1012 protons per pulse longitudinal bunch instabilities are observed in the Fermilab main accelerator. The oscillations are primarily dipole coherent bunch motion with small mixtures of higher order modes. The oscillations grow during acceleration to amplitudes of about ± twenty degrees and remain constant at that amplitude, apparently in equilibrium with the Landau damping process. If sufficient bucket area exists there is no significant beam loss associated with the longitudinal motion but selective extraction and irregular spill structure occurs. \"Mountain range\" data on bunch motion and spectrum analysis of Fourier components of the circulating beam have indicated that the primary sources of the observed instabilities are resonances with high shunt impedances within the accelerating cavities. Although the RF cavities had already been provided with spurious mode damping devices additional damping systems consisting of ferrite loaded coaxial waveguide filters have been designed and are being installed on all accelerating cavities."
"The theoretical and experimental study of beam extraction method using the closed orbit expansion effect is described. The steep slope of the magnetic field variation magnitude is used to change the momentum compaction factor for the limit radial area. The orbit separation is found by computing the dynamical equations, since the behaviour of the betatron oscillation frequencies and the beam phase are investigated in this radial region. The experimental study of the effect is carried out with the ring cyclotron electron model, which is a strong focusing eight sector isochronous cyclotron. Calculated orbit separation in the extraction area is about 2+4 cm. The magnet system which is to obtain the proper gradient of the magnetic field variation and the magnet measurements results are described. The measured value of the orbit separation equals 4 cm. At the same time the space between two orbits without current (free of particles) is about 2 cm and the full current on the separated orbit is equal to that before separation. The theoretically predicted beam phase shift is found to be equal to 30+40°. The obtained results confirm the possibility of the 100% beam extraction from the accelerator with space magnetic field variation."
"On the occasion of DCI construction the question was advanced of possible improvements of usual methods concerning closed orbit correction. The calculations we expose here present two advantages : - The perturbations and corrections are not treated as pointlike dipoles, but inserted in lattice computation by their exactly corresponding transfer matrices. - The selection is not made among all possible correctors. A set of the statistically most efficient correctors is determined by a computational simulation."
 "In order to prevent beam instabilities due to the coupling impedance of vacuum tanks containing septum magnets, electrostatic inflectors, etc. in a proton synchrotron we make routine measurements with portable instruments before installation. For frequencies >20 MHz the physical size of the devices is comparable to λ/4 - the typical problem of microwave measurements - and impedance transformations by Carter- or Smith-Charts or computers are needed to obtain the true impedances. Therefore the measurement of reflection- and transmission-coefficients (S-parameters) is preferable because their magnitude is invariant along a transmission line. A center conductor of 1 cm diameter placed in our standard vacuum pipe forms a 125 Ω coaxial line. If a nonstandard vacuum tank is inserted one observes reflection and transmission coefficients. To save the laborious impedance transformations in the frequency domain the reflected and transmitted waveforms are photographed in the time domain. Their interpretation in terms of frequency dependant impedances is discussed."
 "This paper illustrates how the results of several magnetic field calculation computer programs can be combined to form a single graphical representation of magnetic field quality within the aperture of a superconducting accelerator magnet. The graphical technique can be applied on a magnet by magnet basis over a range of current excitations. The paper illustrates the value of such graphics when the accelerator beam profile is shown within the simulated magnet bore."
"Beam instabilities resulting from localized pressure bumps in the Fermilab main ring have become more significant as the beam intensity has increased. The instability threshold depends on pressure, beam intensity, and machine tune. Experiments are described which explore this threshold using both time dependent and time independent pressure bumps. The effects of gas variations, bump length and time duration are reported."
"Magnetic field mapping of the Indiana main stage cyclotron is performed on a Cartesian grid using a 4 by 4 array of Hall probes. The apparatus, driven by torque motor-assisted, high-speed stepping motors, maps one eighth of the cyclotron beam area in 6 hours. Positioning accuracy is maintained by encoders attached to the stepping motor drive shafts and absolute probe locations are determined using magnetic fiducials on the magnet pole tip. The mapper is interfaced to a digital computer for automatic position control and for field data acquisition, reduction and storage. On-line data reduction includes conversion of Hall voltages to field values, allowing for individual differences in the sensitivity and non-linearity of the probes, and corrections in the fields for measured errors in the relative probe positions. Examples of the field data quality obtained are presented."
 "A series of calculations using measured magnetic fields has been performed to determine the optimal gradient coil currents for the wide range of operating conditions to be experienced by the Indiana University main stage cyclotron. Depending on the particle type to be accelerated and final energy desired, the required radial field increase varies from 0.5% to 22%. An iterative least squares fitting technique is used to minimize orbit time variations. For the acceleration of 200 MeV protons (330 revolutions, fourth harmonic) the maximum phase excursion is predicted to be less than two rf degrees. The technique used can be adapted to using measured phase histories to predict corrections to gradient coil currents."
"The intensity of the Fermilab booster accelerator has been limited in part by longitudinal effects. These include longitudinal space charge blowup prior to RF capture, phase space dilution during capture and insufficient voltage to provide bucket area to accelerate the diluted beam. Measurements of beam properties under these conditions, as well as high intensity effects during acceleration, are presented."
"Measurements are presented of the transverse properties of the booster synchrotron. The principal transverse limitations to operational performance have been due to restricted aperture and improper multiturn injection. In addition to these features, working point, chromaticities, high-intensity effects, and injection matching are discussed."
 "At intensities > 1.5 × 1012 protons per ring, and at reduced RF voltage, fast growing beam loading instabilities occur in the Booster (PSB) with loss of beam bunching. The observed thresholds are reported; they are different from those given by Robinson's1 criterion and occur with a different frequency. To explain this and other observations, a model of the beam loading interaction including the feedback loops controlling RF amplitude, phase and cavity tuning, is presented. In the general case, beam loading causes cross-coupling between all three loops, which for high beam loading makes the system unstable. For low beam loading, which was assumed for the basic systems design, the loops are practically independent. The Robinson criterion is a limiting case of this model (no feedback loops). A method for designing better loops taking into account the cross-coupling is described. It has the advantage over other cures, such as lowering of the cavity Q or feeding the cavity with a current equal to the beam current but of opposite phase, that it does not require extra RF power."
"At the design ramp slope of 125 GeV per second and 5 × 1013 protons per pulse, the RF System in the Fermilab main accelerator must deliver 1 megawatt of power to the proton beam. RF amplitude and phase changes resulting from beam loading during acceleration are compensated for by separate somewhat slow feedback systems. Phase shifts resulting from transient beam loading during injection are compensated for by a third feedback system of broader bandwidth. The feedback systems are described and performance details are discussed."
   "COMA, a computer program written in FORTRAN IV, accurately calculates the relative motion of up to 5000 particles over the complete energy range of the TRIUMF cyclotron at a cost about 1% of our numerical integration codes. In addition it can simulate the action of diagnostic probes and slits. COMA uses linear transformation matrices, obtained from an equilibrium orbit code, that include coupling between radial and longitudinal motion. The energy gain and vertical focusing forces at the dee gap are given by an improved analytical model."
"After a review of the present situation in the AGS incoherent space charge effects in respectively the just injected beam, the coasting beam and the bunched beam are considered. Numerical estimates of shifts and spreads in betatron frequencies are given. The ratio of peak to average azimuthal densities in bunched beams is calculated for parabolic and uniform initial energy distributions. It is concluded that the intensity limit of the AGS is probably set by loss of particles out of vertical betatron phase via resonances and coupling in the early bunched beam."
 "For reducing the chromaticity and suppressing various resonances, several systems composed of trim quadrupoles, skew quadrupoles, regular and skew sextupoles and octupoles are now used in the main ring. These systems make it possible to achieve the transmission in the main ring of 90% or better for the routine operation with the intensity in excess of 1013 protons per pulse. In particular, insertion of one-inch plastic spacers in chromaticity correcting sextupoles has been very effective in compensating for high-order nonlinear fields in the bending magnets."
"The magnitude and sign of the zeroth harmonic skew quadrupole component of the magnetic field at 28.5 BeV are determined by exciting the normal mode frequencies in part of the debunched beam present during a flat top extraction cycle. Simple rf excitation of the (9-Q) mode is employed. Filtered difference signals from pick-up electrodes are used to measure the frequencies and relative phases of the H and V oscillations. During acceleration when the beam is bunched it is kicked horizontally and the radial position adjusted until the coupled vertical motion in the (9-Q) mode reaches a maximum. Correction quadrupoles are then powered to minimize the observed amplitude. The magnitude of the coupling roughly tracks with the beam momentum. Saturation effects at high fields plus the powering of backleg bumps and tuning quadrupoles on the SEB flat top are possible sources of the somewhat larger coupling observed under these conditions."
  "The state of a binary counter that has accumulated pulses is digitally converted to a logarithmic representation to base 2. The characteristic is determined by a shift register which locates the leading bit. A 3-bit mantissa over a factor of 2 is generated by a logic look-up table from the second to the fifth most significant bits. The root mean square error in the mantissa is 2.7% and the maximum error is 6.6%. The output signal is derived from a digital-to-analog converter. In a particular application where the analog output is displayed on a 5-decade scale for counting rates from 0.1 s-1 to 104 s-1, the maximum error from conversion is less than 1% of full-scale reading. Up to 8 decades may be displayed. The minimum counts to be accumulated before conversion, and hence the statistical accuracy, may be preset. The shortest counting time is 5s but longer times, up to 640s, are automatically allowed in order to satisfy a preset count limit."
"X-ray-induced photoconductivity has been measured in low-density polyethylene, Tefzel ‡ (Dupont fluorocarbon), Durasan (Dupont fluorocarbon), polychlorotrifluoroethylene (Kel-F), polystyrene, polypropylene, polyvinylidene chloride, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyvinyl chloride and mica. Dose rates varied in the range 109 - 5 × 1010 rad/s. The observed photoconductivity showed no apparent dependence on the molecular structure of the materials. The photoconductivity of polyethylene and Kel-F was observed to depend on the degree of crystallinity in these materials."

"Studies on the potential use of nuclear desalination in Egypt have been conducted. The choice of reactor type and system concept was influenced by emphasis on relaxed technological conditions so as to fit local circumstances . Natural uranium heavy water reactors were found promising. Finer details of type of fuel, cladding, coolant, and system arrangement were left for comparative studies. The question of fuel type, fuel pin versus fuel cluster, was considered. Simplified analytical and computational techniques were adopted and results verified with published criticality measurements. It was found that the pin design would have higher breeding potentials while the cluster would provide simpler core arrangement especially if a pressure vessel design is chosen. Results are given for a typical 40 MWth project study showing core features and system characteristics."
"The conditions for initiating second breakdown in 1N4148 diodes were investigated with reverse-biasing square pulses following high forward injection (prestress). It was found that at a certain prestress the reverse voltage necessary for inducing second breakdown suddenly drops from the normal reverse breakdown voltage to about 20 percent of this value. At higher prestress the power necessary for junction damage from the reverse pulse is higher by more than an order of magnitude than without prestress, and no transition to second breakdown is observed. These results are not in agreement with present models of second breakdown and junction damage."

  "Transversal filtering consists of forming an output signal from the suitably weighted sum of successively delayed samples of a given input waveform. Although such filters exhibit many attractive features, economic considerations have previously limited their hardware implementation to rather few areas, primarily the fields of communications and radar. However, recent technological developments have significantly reduced the cost of the multiple tapped-delay operations that are required in such filters, thereby greatly expanding their potential areas of application. The purpose of the present paper is two-fold, first to serve as a general introduction to the possibilities of transversal filters for the processing of isolated randomaly distributed pulses (such as occur in experimental nuclear physics), and second to introduce a new implementation of such filters in the form of capacitively tapped delay lines. This latter form of transversal filter is readily fabricated and is well suited for operation on pulses in the few nanosecond to few microsecond time range."
"The accurate measurement of the basic noise parameters of ultra-low noise spectrometer systems has been developed in the frequency domain by spectrum analysis. This method overcomes some of the difficulties experienced in using cmventional techniques. An analytic and experimental comparison between 'time' and frequency domain techniques is carried out and the use of the latter as a method to develop extremely low-noise detector and FET packages is demonstrated. The origin of the remaining noise in high quality systems is traced to surface and gate junction generation through traps in the FET."
"A new type of flat delay line was developed which has a low propagation velocity and very good delay to rise time ratio. It can be constructed by printed circuit techniques without crossovers. The magnetic loops of a shifted periodic structure yield high inductance per unit length. Geometric scaling factors are shown. This line, forming the cathode plane of a proportional chamber, allows simultaneously, a satisfactory induced signal and the readout of the second coordinate by time delay without disturbing the electric field configuration around the anode. Optimization of position resolution vs. noise is discussed. Experimental results are shown. Other properties of such delay lines are discussed."
"This paper describes the general features of a pulse processor for use with opto-electronic charge sensitive head amplifiers particularly with Si(Li) X-ray detectors. The instrument contains time-variant filters with direct coupled amplifiers and comprehensive pile-up protection and live time correction. The test results indicate that the system can cope with extremely wide range of signal processing times, counting rates and changes of spectral content without any appreciable degradation in energy resolution and with useful output rates for input rates up to well over 50,000 events/sec."
"The applications of position sensitive counters and multichannel analyzers to X-ray diffraction data collection from live muscle undergoing contraction are described in this paper. Electronic data collection methods are described which enable time resolved studies of the X-ray patterns. It is expected that such information will lead to a clearer understanding of the structural changes, at a molecular level, taking place during muscular contraction."
 "The peculiar characteristics of an autonomous CAMAC system based on the use of an Intel 8080 microprocessor are described. The system memory for program store, scratch work and data acquisition is contained in the autonomous CAMAC controller. Memory can be accessed in DMA mode with 24-bit data utilizing three bytes with a unique address. Suitable 3-byte floating point mathematical subroutines have been developed for general use and in particular for the requirements of the system. Details on hardware and software of the system are illustrated together with a brief mention of the generalizations."
  "This paper describes experiments designed to extend the simulation of IEMP effects by fast pulse (<5 ns) electron-beam techniques, to larger areas (>700 cm2) and greater total currents (~9 kA) than heretofore. Both charge and current neutralization as a function of pressure from <10-2 mTorr to 700 mTorr were determined with an electron-beam facility that generated an injected pulse with rise time ~l.5 ns and a peak intensity of 12.5 A/cm2. The results indicate that for such large time rate of change of total currents, the necessary pressure to achieve space-charge barrier dissipation before the peak of the pulse will also lead to avalanche breakdown of the ambient gas, occurring at almost the same time and thus reducing the net transmitted current."
"In this paper, the stability-equation method is applied to the analysis of a nuclear reactor control system with multiple transport-lags and an asymmetrical nonlinearity. The characteristics of limit-cycles can be defined easily, and the effects of adjustable parameters can be realized directly. Based upon the presented analyses, the considered system has asymmetrical oscillation. These are checked by computer simulations."
"A conversational data access method is proposed in order to avoid the complexity of procedures for data access of CRT operator consoles. The procedure proposed here is composed of three hierarchical steps (tree structural steps), related to the systems of plant components and operational modes. It is concluded from the simulation experiment that the procedure proposed here is superior in many respects to that of the long code entry method."

 "The radiation sensitivity of MOS devices has been recognized to be the result of a charge buildup caused by the sweepout of electrons and the trapping of holes following hole-electron pair production by ionizing radiation. Holes have been shown to have a finite, although small, mobility in thermally grown SiO2. Trapping of holes takes place near the Si-SiO2 interface, possibly by oxygen vacancies in the oxide. Normal thermally grown SiO2 possesses only small concentrations of electron traps. Electron traps have been shown to be generated, however, in the oxide by ion implantation, by irradiation with nonpenetrating electrons, and by exposure of the surface of the oxide to negative ions from a corona discharge. Although Na+ and Li+ ions have been shown to be mobile at room temperature in SiO2, contamination can be kept to levels where ionic charge buildup is negligible. The role of contaminants in the formation of hole traps, however, remains to be determined."
"The effects of processing steps on the radiation hardness of MOS devices have been systematically investigated. Quantitative relationships between the radiation-induced voltage shifts and processing parameters have been determined, where possible. Using the results of process optimization, a controlled baseline fabrication process for aluminum-gate CMOS has been defined. CMOS inverters which can survive radiation exposures well in excess of 108 rads (Si) have been fabricated. Restrictions that the observed physical dependences place upon possible models for the traps responsible for radiation-induced charging in SiO2 are discussed."
"Irradiation studies at 76°K are described which demonstrate that radiation-produced holes in SiO2 are immobile at this temperature. If an electric field of either polarity is present in the SiO2 during 76°K irradiation, to sweep out the mobile electrons, the holes will virtually all be trapped where created and produce a uniform positive charge density in the oxide. This predicts ΔVT ∝ dox2 , which is observed. The magnitude of the observed shift is consistent with 18 eV required per hole-electron pair generated. All CMOS transistors of the same oxide thickness exhibit the same initial ΔVT, for a given exposure level, regardless of oxide type or process. The rate of annealing differs, both as a function of oxidation process and oxide thickness. Thin oxides have two advantages: a smaller ΔVT (stable shift) and faster annealing. If a CMOS device is irradiated for sufficient time at 76°K to build in an appreciable field, further irradiation with zero gate-substrate bias will produce little additional change in VT, since the field in the oxide tends to keep all generated electrons in the oxide, where they recombine with trapped holes. Room temperature annealing following a pulsed gamma exposure occurs in two regimes. The first regime can be quite fast, and occurs prior to 10-4 seconds. The magnitude of this early-time recovery is both process dependent and thickness dependent."
"The transient response of SiO2 gate-insulator MOS capacitors to pulsed electron beam irradiation was studied. The radiation-induced flatband voltage shift (Δ VFB) in SiO2 MOS capacitors was measured with a fast C-V technique from 70 μsec to 1000 sec after a 60 krad radiation pulse for temperatures from 80 to 293 K. In complementary experiments, the post-irradiation charge displacement in the MOS capacitors was measured with an integrating picoammeter. By correlating the relaxation of the flatband voltage with integrated current measurements, it was established that the measured response is dominated by hole transport and trapping in the SiO2 film. The temporal and temperature dependences of the hole transport are well described by a stochastic hopping model based on a continuous time random walk (CTRW). The essential feature of the CTRW is that the transport occurs via a carrier hopping (phonon assisted) process between localized sites randomly distributed in the amorphous SiO2. Since the carriers do not require excitation to the band edges in order to be mobilized, the activation energy for conduction (tunneling) is independent of the optical excitation energy."
"Measurements are reported in which the charge stored in the oxide of an MOS device exposed to ionizing radiation is studied as a function of oxide pretreatment. Implantation with Al+ ions is found to introduce electron traps into the oxide and the stability of these traps is examined in thermal annealing experiments. The predictions of a simple model, in which the implantation associated displacement damage is considered to be the source of the additional electron traps, is compared to the experimental observations."
"This paper reports experimental and analytical studies performed on Al+ ion-implanted MOS capacitors. Electrons and holes were excited in SiO2 by a low-energy electron beam, the resultant current measured, and the results then compared to findings for unimplanted specimens. Comparisons were also made of flatband voltage shifts for implanted and unimplanted devices. Analytical expressions, based on a physical model, are developed which explain the experimental results. In this model, decreases in collected current and changes in flatband voltage shift are attributed to both hole and electron trapping in the implanted region. Thus, the model contains three critical parameters: the mobility-lifetime products for both holes and electrons in the implanted region and the depth of this region. While a range of these variables satisfy either the current vs voltage measurements or the flatband-voltage-shift results, considered jointly these experiments provide specific values for all three parameters. The depth of the implanted region so determined agrees well with experimental observation, and the mobility-lifetime products calculated for different experimental conditions are consistent. The product for holes (~3.5 × 10-13 cm2/V) is substantially smaller than that for electrons (~2 × 10-12 cm2/V), indicating that holes are more easily trapped in the implanted zone than electrons. The fact that more electrons than holes are actually trapped in the case of gamma irradiation under positive bias is explained by the model. Bias dependence is also explained, as well as the fact that there is an optimum implantation energy for minimizing flatband shifts."
"This paper reports the results of experiments designed to optimize the total dose ionizing radiation hardness of CMOS/SOS devices. Type 4007 inverter circuits were fabricated with variations in the process, including wet versus dry gate oxidation. Tolerable values (e. g. < l#x003BC;A per mil of channel width) of post-radiation n-channel back leakage were obtained only with wet oxides. Threshold shifts of ≤1V for the n-channel devices and ≤2V for the p-channel devices were obtained after 106 rads (Si) on the best devices fabricated."
"Ionizing radiation effects and hardening procedures have been investigated using simple CMOS/SOS circuits fabricated with SiO2 gate insulators. A modified gate oxidation process using steam and HCl has resulted in improved gate oxide hardness -- with threshold voltage shifts of less than two volts up to a total dose of 106 rads(Si). Radiation-induced n-channel leakage currents were reduced by more than two orders of magnitude by using a deep boron ion implant and appropriate process ing techniques. Post-irradiation values of less than 0.5μA/mil have been obtained using this procedure. Studies of charge buildup at the silicon-sapphire interface indicate an effective positive charge in the range of 1011 cm-2 to 1012 cm-2 - peaking at a total dose of about 105 rads (Si). This effective charge decreases for increasing doses above 5×105 rads(Si). The decrease is attributed to radiation-induced interface states."
  "The total ionizing radiation effects of n-channel enhancement mode silicon on sapphire MISFET's have been characterized up to a total dose of 107 rads (Si). The drain current versus drain voltage characteristics of the n-channel devices showing the \"kink\" effect were measured over a range of gate voltages and as a function of ionizing radiation. The effect of the ionizing radiation on the \"kink\" phenomenon was determined and the implications of this effect on the radiation hardness of n-channel MISFET's is discussed. The results show that the equivalent threshold voltage at the operating drain voltage must be defined and used in determining the radiation hardness of the n-channel device. The radiation induced back channel leakage currents of n-channel MISFET's are characterized in terms of device geometry and the amount of radiation induced trapped charge in the sapphire substrate. Results showing the leakage current plotted as a function of drain voltage suggest that the \"kink\" effect and related phenomena also enhance the radiation induced leakage current effects and lead to substantially increased values of leakage current."
"The permanent ionizing radiation effects resulting from charge trapping in a silicon nitride isolation dielectric has been determined for a total ionizing dose up to 107 rads (Si). Junction FET's, whose active channel region is directly adjacent to the siliconsilicon nitride interface, were used to measure the effects of the radiation induced charge trapping in the Si3N4 isolation dielectric. The JFET saturation current and channel conductance versus junction gate voltage and substrate voltage were characterized as a function of the total ionizing radiation dose. The experimental results on the Si3N4 are compared to results on similar devices with SiO2 dielectric isolation. The ramifications of using the silicon nitride for fabricating radiation hardened dielectrically isolated MIS devices are discussed."
"Ionizing-radiation-induced threshold voltage shifts in CMOS integrated circuits will drastically degrade circuit performance unless the design parameters related to the fabrication process are properly chosen. To formulate an approach to CMOS design optimization, experimentally observed analytical relationships showing strong dependences between threshold voltage shifts and silicon dioxide thickness are utilized. These measurements were made using radiation-hardened aluminum-gate CMOS inverter circuits and have been corroborated by independent data taken from MOS capacitor structures. Knowledge of these relationships allows one to define ranges of acceptable CMOS design parameters based upon radiation-hardening capabilities and post-irradiation performance specifications. Furthermore, they permit actual design optimization of CMOS integrated circuits which results in optimum pre-and post-irradiation performance with respect to speed, noise margins, and quiescent power consumption. Theoretical and experimental results of these procedures, the applications of which can mean the difference between failure and success of a CMOS integrated circuit in a radiation environment, are presented."
"Data has been collected that shows the permanent threshold voltage shift occurring in MOS transistors exposed to the same total dose of gamma radiation can be greater in a high dose-rate environment than in a low dose-rate environment. This dose-rate effect is ascribed to a \"Photovoltaic\" bias generation in the substrate of a device which results in an effective gate bias change (positive for P-channel and negative for N-channel transistors). The bias change ranges from 0 to ±1 volt during the radiation burst. Thus, in a high dose-rate ionizing environment, the permanent gate threshold voltage shift of an MOS device, which is known to be a function of the gate bias during irradiation, will exhibit an indirect dose-rate dependence which is caused by an internal change in instantaneous gate bias."
"This paper will review some of the radiation effects problems that have been encountered in nuclear fuel rods. Examples are drawn from both the commercial Light Water Reactors (LWR) and the new, developing Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactors (LMFBR). The performance of a particular fuel rod is influenced by (1) the interaction between the ceramic fuel pellet column and the metal cladding tube, and (2) the interactions of the fuel cladding, separately, with the reactor core environment. The latter includes the effect of neutron flux, temperature, stress and corrosive chemicals. Despite this complex and hostile environment, many of the material interactions are known. Sufficient new detail will enable the fuel rod and the core power operation to be designed so that a very low incidence of fuel rod failures can be maintained."
 "Electron spin resonance and etch-back techniques have been employed to identify radiation-induced defect centers in thermally grown oxide films on SOS wafers and to determine their spatial distribution in the oxide film. The only defect identified was the E' center, which was found to be indistinguishable from E' centers in irradiated bulk fused silica samples. The distribution of E' centers in-oxide films irradiated to a dose of 108 rad (Si) was observed to consist of a uniform bulk distribution plus a concentration build-up near the Si-SiO2 interface. The application of a positive 10 volt bias to a 1.08kÅ gate oxide during gamma irradiation produced an order of magnitude increase in the E' center concentration."
"The transport and trapping of holes generated by strongly absorbed UV light has been observed in SiO2. Hole photocurrents decay with time under small applied fields because the accumulation of trapped holes in the light-absorbing region counteracts the applied field. However, with increasing applied fields a steady-state hole photocurrent has been observed for the first time. The quantum efficiency for hole collection saturates at 100% as the applied field is increased. A new mechanism for radiation-induced currents has been observed: The trapping of holes near the Si-SiO2 interface enhances Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, producing electron-injection currents nearly two orders of magnitude larger than the photo-current. Upon cessation of the radiation these field-induced currents decay slowly with time as trapped holes are gradually annihilated, giving the appearance of very slow carriers being swept out of the oxide. Hole photocurrents increase with field, saturating at about 3 MV/cm. This is interpreted as a decrease in electron-hole pair recombination with increasing field. A qualitative model involving hole transport and trapping near both interfaces satisfactorily explains the experimental results. The trapping and injection phenomena are shown to be extremely sensitive to high-temperature processing parameters and, therefore, provide sensitive tools for investigation and optimization of radiation hardness."
"Volume changes in ion-bombarded single crystals of sapphire and α-quartz have been investigated as functions of ion mass and initial energy and of the energy partitioning into atomic and ionization processes. In addition, channeled proton-induced X-ray measurements were made of displacement damage after ion bombardment. Results indicate an ionization stimulated annealing effect of the radiation damage in sapphire which prevents this material from becoming amorphous even at high ion fluences. In contrast, α-quartz shows no such annealing effect and loses its crystallinity completely at high ion fluences."
"Optical absorption, thermal annealing and X-irradiation studie s are reported on samples of boron implanted sapphire. The measurements indicate that implantation produces displacement damage in the sapphire with associated optical absorption bands at 2600 Å and 2050 Å as well as causing a displacement of the fundamental absorption edge to lower energies. The displacement damage can be thermally annealed with major stages at about 375°C and 850°C. X-irradiation to a dose of circa 107 rads (Si) after a partial thermal anneal does not change the magnitude of any absorption band or introduce new bands. The implications of the observed behavior for boron implanted MOSOS devices is discussed."
"The results of an extensive investigation of the optical response of thirteen common optical materials to 2.5-MeV electron irradiation is reported. Radiation-induced absorption and absolute radioluminescence yields were measured in the wavelength range 0.14 to 0.9 μm for dose rates between 5 × 102 and 5 × 105 rad/sec at doses from 2.3 × 103 to 4.5 × 108 rads. Determinations were made of (a) the absolute radioluminescence yield, (b) the dose rate dependence yield, (c) the spectral and temporal distribution of the radioluminescence and induced absorption, (d) the growth curve of the induced absorption versus total dose, (e) the dose-rate dependence of the absorption, and (f) the bleaching of the absorption after irradiation. In addition, where available, samples from different melts were investigated to determine the variation in the above effects with manufacturing variations."
"The growth of color centers during irradiation, and the decay after irradiation, has been studied in two glasses using recently developed equipment for making optical absorption and luminescence measurements during and after electron irradiation. The glasses studied were NBS 710, a soda-lime silicate glass and NBS 711, a lead-silicate glass. Both glasses exhibit similar coloring characteristics. The radiation induced absorption spectra consists of a weak Gaussian shaped band in the visible, a stronger Gaussian band in the ultra violet and a band edge \"shift\" which may be accurately approximated by a third Gaussian band. For all absorption bands the color center vs. dose (or irradiation time) curves can be accurately resolved into two saturating exponential and one linear component. The decay curves obtained after the irradiation is terminated can be accurately expressed by three exponential components. Coloring and decay curves made at different dose rates indicate that the processes responsible for decay after irradiation and electron hole recombination during irradiation play important roles in determining the rate and extent of coloring. The results are qualitatively in agreement with some very simple kinetic treatments for color center formation. In some, but not all, respects the quantitative agreement is also good."
"The visible and infrared cathodoluminescence spectra of undoped polycrystalline and single-crystal ZnSe and ZnS have been measured at 295, 78, and 10 K. Infrared luminescence bands were detected at 1.8, 2.4, 3.2, and 3.8 pm in IRTRAN 4 (ZnSe) and single-crystal ZnSe, but not in Raytran ZnSe. Similarly, bands at 1.4, 1.6, and 1.9 am were detected in IRTRAN 2 (ZnS) and single-crystal ZnS, but not in Raytran ZnS. The infrared luminescence in ZnSe materials is accompanied by edge emission and the copper red band, in addition to the copper green band appearing in IRTRAN 4. Self-activated luminescence was observed in Raytran ZnSe. The power law decay of the 1.8 and 3.8 pm bands in IRTRAN 4 suggests a bimolecular kinetic reaction. A model is proposed to account for the transitions involved."
"We have measured the X-ray-induced photoconductivity in Kapton (Dupont polyimide) and Teflon over the temperature range 100-5000K. The observed temperature dependence of the photoconductivity was strikingly different for these two materials. The qualitative behavior of the Kapton samples was consistent with the predictions of a model where the delayed photoconductivity signal is due to thermal release of trapped charge. In the case of the Teflon samples, the observed prompt conductivity was almost temperature independent and we observed a pronounced peak in the delayed component of the photoconductivity at about 360°K. The decay time of the delayed photoconductivity for Teflon was also observed to be temperature dependent. We discuss changes in the occupation of deep trapping levels as a possible mechanism for the observed thermal quenching of the Teflon photoconductivity."
"The energy and temperature dependences of electron damage in GaAs have been measured. The energy dependence data have been compared with theoretical calculations made using the RECOIL code. Both the carrier removal and the scattering addition can be fit by the theory using reasonable assumptions. The carrier removal rate (at higher energies) requires a displacement threshold of ~25 eV, and the scattering addition is fit best if an effective charge of 25% of the defects in the clusters is assumed. The carrier removal is dominated by isolated defect production, at least up to ~50 MeV, whereas multiply charge clusters are more effective scatterers. These clusters are more readily produced by higher-energy electrons. An isolated defect annealing stage exists at 200 to 250°K, but the clusters anneal at all temperatures between at least 77 and 300° K."
"Radiation effects studies have been performed at 10 and 80°K in bulk Hgo.8CdO.2Te. These studies concentrated on radiation damage to the material properties, such as lifetime, carrier density, mobility, and electrical conductivity, which are important in determining the performance of an Hg0.8CdO.2Te infrared detector. In n-type material, an increase in carrier density was observed for electron, gamma, and neutron irradiations at both 10 and 80°K. At 10°K, a carrier introduction of +16 cm-1 was measured for 5-MeV electrons, compared to an introduction rate of ~3 cm-1 for fusion neutrons. In the relatively uncompensated material used for the study, the lifetime was Auger-limited and exhibited the expected carrier density dependence ( τ ∝ n-2) during electron irradiations at 10 and 80°K. Lifetime damage produced by fission neutrons at 80°K indicated both a Shockley-Read and an Auger component. Application of the radiation effects data to a photoconductive detector with ohmic contacts indicates that a detector operating at a bias level which produces minority-carrier sweepout is substantiallv more radiation-resistant than one operated in the non-sweepout mode."
"The purpose of these experiments was to formulate a better model for the structures of lattice defects and defect-impurity complexes in irradiated n-type Ge. Single crystals were grown by the Czochralski process from P, As, or Sb-doped melts, and ≤ 1015 to ≤ 1017 oxygen cm-3 was added to the furnace chamber after ~ 1/3 of the crystal had been solidified. Hall coefficient and resistivity measurements (at 77°K) were used to determine the initial donor concentration due to the dopant and clustered oxygen, and infrared absorption measurements (at 11.7 μ) were used to determine the dissociated oxygen concentration. Certain impurity and defect-impurity interactions were then investigated that occurred as a consequence of selected annealing, quenching, Li diffusion, and irradiation experiments at ~ 300°K with 60Co photons, 1.5-2.0 MeV electrons, or thermal energy neutrons. Particular attention was given to determining the electrical role of the irradiation produced interstitial and vacancy, and to look for any evidence from electrical and optical measurements of vacancy-oxygen, lithium-oxygen, and lithium-vacancy interactions. A tentative model was developed for the lattice defect and defect-impurity structures, however, it was evident that any interpretation of defect-impurity interactions as a consequence of irradiation or annealing was subject to considerable error if the concentration and electrical role of certain impurities was not determined."
"Optimized dry oxide processes have recently yielded notable improvements in CMOS radiation hardness. For these processes to be manufacturable, controls and screens are required to allow both manufacturer and user to guarantee survival of specific radiation environments. Four aspects of controlling a radiation hardened process are discussed. The electrical characteristics and constraints of a hardened technology are outlined. The statistical relations between radiation survival probability and process hardness capabilities are developed. The process steps which are key to achieving hardness are identified and the required controls on these steps are determined. Finally, the subject of hardness screening is explored to determine necessary actions, prerad and postrad, to insure that radiation requirements are met."
"A new electrical correlation parameter is described which correlates with neutron damage in TTL integrated circuits. This measurement can be applied to the majority of TTL device types using the normal device pinout, eliminating any requirement for custom metallization patterns. The correlation is based on the analytical relationship between VBE and basetransit time for internal transistors within the integrated circuit. Examples of the effectiveness of this correlation parameter are included for 54L and 54 series TTL devices, along with suggested applications to hardness assurance programs."
 "A dosimetry system was designed and constructed based on silicon calorimeters. Both silicon thermocouple and thermistor calorimeters, used in the study of Ipp measurements of silicon transistors, are described. The system provided active total-dose measurements at six radiation facilities: a Linac and five FXR pulsers. The system gave accurate and consistent results with a minimum of complications."
"An experiment is described which measures the permanent degradation of silicon device parameters as a function of neutron energy. The neutron source is a nuclear weapon with time-of-flight giving energy resolution. The neutron spectrum is measured with a dielectric track detector, and 20,000 transistors measure the neutron caused degradation. An integral equation is unfolded to yield the energy dependence of neutron damage."
"Displacement and ionization kerma calculations have been performed for silicon using cross sections from the ENDF/B Version IV MAT 1194 evaluation. Kerma were calculated by the code KMART, which is an extension of the MACK code. The present ionization results are in excellent agreement with recent measurements."
"Neutron spectrum measurements were made at the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) Fast Burst Reactor (FBR), a Godiva type critical assembly. The spectrum measurements were performed by neutron activation techniques coupled with the computer code SAND II. Results from this investigation reveal a spectral index of 6.7 for the leakage spectrum and 7.8 for the Glory Hole spectrum or, the neutron leakage spectrum of this Godiva type critical assembly is harder by - 30% when comparing its spectral index to previous measurements. Furthermore, the neutron spectrum measured in the Glory Hole for the FBR reveals that this spectrum is softer than the leakage spectrum by a factor of 1.16 for the spectral indicies."
"Since it was first noted that the experimental damage equivalence ratios for different neutron spectra obtained from change in transistor parameter behavior did not agree with the calculated ratios based on damage to silicon, an explanation has been sought for this apparent discrepancy. Investigations have included device processing techniques device geometry, and finally dosimetry. Careful dosimetry is of the utmost importance to these ratio measurements. Recently extensive studies of the White Sands Fast Burst Reactor (FBR), which is identical to the Sandia Pulsed Reactor (SPR-II), yielded information which suggested that a significant error was possible in the SPR-II dosimetry utilized in earlier studies. A test group at SAl726 (2N4251) transistors were used to make a comparison of the spectrum from the FBR and the SPR-II. The results of the device study showed a difference of 25-30 percent in fluence measured by Sandia dosimetry and by White Sands dosimetry for a given FBR exposure. This difference was for a 10 KeV energy threshold. These findings prompted an investigation of the Sandia dosimetry techniques used at SPR-II. This investigation showed, on the basis of dosimetry measurements excluding fission foils, that the 10 KeV/3 MeV ratio for SPR-II was 7.5 instead of 10 as presently used. The correction in dosimetry from SPR-II when applied to earlier damage equivalence ratios changes the 14 MeV-to-SPR-II damage ratio from 4.2 to approximately 2.9. This value (2.9) is in good agreement with other experimenters and calculations based on displacement damage in silicon."
"The present state of calculational techniques for IEMP and SGEMP phenomena is reviewed, with emphasis on the physical, mathematical, and geometrical approximations made in various approaches. Some speculations are made on the ultimate capabilities of computer calculations, and the need for analytical calculations, especially simple methods for making estimates, is stressed. Finally, the possibly fruitful competition and complementation between digital (computer) and analogue (electrical simulation) techniques are discussed."
"Results are presented from an extensive parametric study of x-ray photoemission. Calculations were performed of fore and back emission yield and energy-angular distribution, including the two-dimensional, asymmetric angular distribution for non-normal photon incidence, for a broad range of photon energies, angles of incidence, and material atomic numbers. Monte Carlo and analytical calculations are compared with one another and with experimental data. A new Monte Carlo method is presented which makes feasible the calculation of the two-dimensional angular distribution and yields a continuous representation of the distribution in functional form."
 "The model describes coupled electron/photon transport through extended media in the presence of macroscopic magnetic fields of arbitrary spatial dependence. Collisional transport is accomplished via condensed-history electron Monte Carlo and single-scattering photon Monte Carlo. Production and transport of relevant secondary electrons and photons are included along with electron energy loss straggling. State-of-the-art differential equation solvers are employed in order to obtain the magnetic field trajectories of the electrons. Options are available which allow for transport through variable density media and for switching the field off in regions where transport is collision dominated. Results from selected model applications are also presented."
"Investigations into the sensitivity of SGEMP responses of simple geometries to various input parameters are made using the arbitrary body-of-revolution code ABORC. In particular, sensitivity of the response to emitted electron energy and angular distributions, emission levels, time dependence of the energy spectrum, time-phasing, and the choice of emission surfaces is investigated. Sensitivity to time-phasing, the choice of emission surfaces, and the time dependence of the energy spectrum is found to be relatively large, while sensitivity to energy and angular distributions and total yield variations arising from differences between the various emission predictive techniques and experiments is found to be relatively small. Electron emission codes now in existence appear to be adequate for predicting SGEMP responses, at least in the energy range above 1 keV."
 "Self-consistent, fully dynamic computer calculations were performed using the recently developed arbitrary body-of-revolution code ABORC for complex geometries in SGEMP environments to test the validity of simplifying geometry assumptions previously made in the solutions of these problems. Assumptions such as simple geometry representations of complex bodies and separability of inside and outside problems are tested. Effects of gaps, interior electrical paths, and booms protruding from bodies are discussed. High space-charge-limited results are emphasized. The response of simple bodies such as cylinders and spheres was found to be similar to more complex geometries in terms of peak currents and response rise times, although much of the detail in terms of resonant frequencies, internal responses, and responses around reentrant bodies is lost. The inside and outside responses of an object can be separated in many cases even though both solutions by themselves are highly nonlinear and the leakage currents are relatively large. The external response of a highly segmented body is similar to the response of a smoothly connected body of revolution. The internal response can be considerably different when a conducting path exists between the segments."
"In this paper a Green's function is developed to describe the surface current induced by a longitudinal time varying electric field on the surface of an infinite length, perfectly conducting cylinder imbedded in a homogeneous conducting medium. Accurate analytic approximations to this Green's function are also presented along with calculational results of the current response for specified electric field and conductivity behavior."
"Fully self-consistent and Thevenin-equivalent treatments of a l-d space charge limited diode connected to external circuitry have revealed that induced circuit currents resulting from the two different approaches are, in many respects, in good agreement with one another. Trial calculations were performed for frequently-encountered circuit component values and a wide range of fluences (from linear to very severely space charge limited regimes). Although additional exploratory work remains to be done, these results provide strong evidence for extensive applicability of the Thevenin-equivalent technique to coupling particle/ field solutions of SGEMP problems external to a satellite to circuitry within that satellite. Results from a fully dynamic 2-d code are also presented as an illustration of the use of the Thevenin technique in analyses of real systems."
"This paper presents results from a SGEMP/IEMP phenomenological experiment designed to explore the behavior of an axially injected electron beam Within a cylindrical test chamber, Data on two different injected beams characterized by mean electron energies of 40 and 60 keV and pulse durations of approximately 80 and 30 nsecs full width at half maximum (FWHM) respectively are presented. These data include internal local magnetic fields, transmitted current and transmitted current distributions, localized wall segment currents and radial current densities as a function of pressure. The pressure range extends from -1μ to over 10 torr."
"In this paper, several methods for calculating the structural replacement currents generated by SGEMP are discussed. A hybrid method, combining a finite difference, particle-following approach in space with a circuit equivalent model for the spacecraft, is then developed, with emphasis on how the two techniques can be properly linked together. Some sample results using this technique are then given and compared with finite difference calculations."
"The usual treatment of electromagnetic fields generated when photoelectrons are ejected from satellite surfaces describes these fields as either external (SGEMP), when the sources are externally ejected electrons or internal (IEMP), when the sources are ejected internal to the satellite structure. In this paper the main thrust is to investigate the coupling to the interior from external sources."
"We have demonstrated the ability of MOC to solve transmission line problems, with space and time varying parameters. As a practical application, we developed a computer code for obtaining the response of a long cable subject to a γ-environment when the far end of the cable is terminated either in a pure resistive load or in an impulse-response impedance. For cables without air gaps the current drive and the distributed conductance induced by the γ-radiation are both proportional to the incident γ-intensity. For cables with a small air gap next to the metal shield, the current drive induced by the γ-radiation is affected by the induced air conductivity such that io(x,t) is proportional to the incident γ-intensity or its time derivative according to dePlomb's criteria. The effect of air gap tends to reduce the peak value of short-circuit current response at x = o. When the resultant distributed conductance G of the cable, with or without an air gap, induced by the γ-radiation is of the order of 10-4 mho/m or smaller, the cable acts as a linear network and a Norton (Thevenin) equivalent circuit can be employed at the input terminal."
"In this paper, the feasibility of simulating SGEMP threat-related responses at the loads of multiwire satellite cables is theoretically examined. Two basically different threat-related modes of excitation are considered. One involves generic photon excitation, both nonattenuated (or uniform) and attenuated. The second involves generic electromagnetic field excitation, both nonpropagating (or uniform) and propagating. The simulation technique which is considered for the photon-related response is capacitance pipe excitation; the corresponding technique which is considered for the electromagnetic field-related response is toroid excitation. The investigation uses the time dependent solutions of the multiwire transmission line equations which are coupled with the appropriate definitions of the pertinent current and/or voltage source terms. The results obtained from the prelusive feasibility study indicate that such simulation techniques could reproduce the responses afforded by the threat-related excitation."
"In this paper we examine, theoretically, various simulation techniques which are considered feasible means to reproduce the external surface currents on satellite structures which result from system generated electromagnetic pulses (SGEMP). These techniques include a) plane wave excitation, b) monopole near-field excitation (in the limit of small monopole-to-satellite spacing, this can be considered capacitance coupling excitation), c) hardwire (from satellite to ground) current injection excitation, and d) charge injection excitation using a small self-contained pulser. The simulation effectiveness of each of these techniques, based on the ability of the simulation method to reproduce surface currents comparable to those predicted for generic SGEMP excitation, is explored. The conclusions gleaned from this investigation are the followinq: 1) the monopole excitation technique produces responses that simulate most favorably those predicted for the SGEMP excitation; 2) either current injection scheme (c or d above) will produce responses comparable to those predicted for local electron emission excitation provided the excitation scheme is sufficiently decoupled from the satellite; and 3) plane wave excitation produces responses that are significantly different both in the peak magnitude variation around the satellite body, and in the frequency content of the pulses, from those predicted for SGEMP."
"Increasing attention has been given to the problem of predicting the response of satellites to the system-generated electromagnetic pulse (SGEMP). This paper presents results of the first SGEMP electrical injection simulation experiments on the SKYNET satellite and compares them with pretest predictions. The important advantages offered by the electrical injection techniques are reviewed in light of the experimental findings. Latest advances in the state-of-the-art of injection pulsers, wide-bandwidth current probes and voltage probes, and dielectric transmission systems (dielectric waveguides and fiber optics) are highlighted. The significance of the results lies in the conclusion that electrical simulation techniques may provide the satellite community with a non-destructive, believable test method for satellite verification."
"Merewether and Ezell recently reported a study of the electrical response of bare metallic cylinders to Compton current pulses in ionized air. They solved Maxwell's equations by the method of finite differences. We have extended this study to insulated metallic cylinders, by representing the effect of a thin insulating layer by a boundary condition on the tangential electric field at the ionized air/insulator interface. This method is several orders of magnitude cheaper than the brute force method of using distance increments the thickness of the insulating layer. It is now economically feasible to study the response to a nuclear environment of the many military systems which are insulated by paint, polyethylene, concrete ablative layers or heat shields."
"Recent studies of SGEMP circuit hardening techniques indicate that the ferrite bead is an ideal component for these purposes. However, to many designers, its ability to introduce high-frequency losses into a circuit is still widely misunderstood. In this paper, the basic attenuation properties of ferrite shielding beads are discussed in detail, as well as other important parameters and environmental considerations which might affect their usefulness in a SGEMP reduction application. Analytical techniques to predict insertion loss ratios in circuitry with beads are developed, and the effects of gapping and dc bias on the effective impedance levels presented by ferrite beads are examined."
 "The relative neutron irradiation hardness of photoconductive and photovoltaic InSb infrared detectors is examined for various operating modes and conditions. It is found that photoconductors are much less vulnerable to fast neutrons at 78K than are photovoltaic detectors. The damage mechanisms for photovoltaic detectors are increased leakage currents coupled with a decrease of minority carrier lifetime in the bulk region with a damage constant of 1.5 × 10-14 #x003BC;m-2 n-1 cm2, while a carrier removal rate of 1.1 cm-1 is established for 14 MeV neutron-irradiated p-type InSb with an initial carrier concentration of ~3 × 1014 cm-3. It is shown that these changes in material parameters can be used to predict fast neutron damage under all realistic operating conditions. The effects of neutron irradiations on signal, noise, current-voltage characteristics and spectral response are discussed in detail."
"A model for calculating the rate and amplitude of gamma ionization events in infrared detectors is presented. Several simplifying approximations to the actual, complex physical situation are applied in the model, thereby allowing an exact analytical formulation of the problem. Experimental measurements of nuclear-radiation induced noise pulse-height distributions and event rates are compared to predictions made using the model. Comparisons of experiment and theory were made at several different gamma energies to provide confirmation of the model over the gamma energy range of interest of most application. The experimentally-confirmed model allows prediction of the noise response of photoconduction detectors for any specified detector material, geometry, surrounding material and incident gamma spectrum."
"The ionizing radiation response of a variety of radiation resistant bulk glasses and optical fibers has been measured. The spectral character and time dependence of the radiation-induced optical losses in high purity silicas and silica-containing fibers has been determined for a range of doses and dose rates. Intrinsic optical loss and radiation response measurements on several types of cerium-protected silicate glasses and fibers have indicated that moderate loss (≈ 100 db/km), high numerical aperture, radiation resistant fiber waveguides are achievable by cerium doping of silicates provided that sufficiently pure materials are utilized. Total fiber loss data, that is, radiation-induced loss plus intrinsic loss, have been generated vs time following pulsed irradiation."
"Three separate studies of radiation-induced absorption in glass and plastic waveguides have been completed. First, the absorption induced by low dose-rate 60Co gamma rays and 90Sr beta rays has been measured and compared with results obtained using higher dose rates. The comparison shows the absorption is independent of dose-rate from 500 rads/day to 106 rads/day to total doses of 6 x 104 rads. Second, the absorption induced in optical fibers by 14 MeV neutrons has been measured. The data were compared with results from 60Co gamma-ray irradiations using calculated values of the neutron ionizing dose as a basis of comparison. The results show that the absorption induced by 14 MeV neutrons at the fluences reported here is determined by the neutron ionizing dose in the spectral region from 400 nm to 1100 nm. Third, the effects of temperature on the transient absorption following pulsed electron irradiation has been measured. Predictions from kinetic models for geminate recombination, tunneling, thermal untrapping, and impurity-associated scavenging were compared with the experimental data. The results appear to identify kinetic processes that determine recombination in various irradiated waveguides."
"The effects of gamma radiation on optical isolators have been investigated. This study has included the simultaneous irradiation and measurement of the individual emitters and detectors making up the isolators. In this manner, the net effect of irradiation on the isolators could be attributed to the degradation of either the emitter or detector, or both. As expected, isolators containing photodiodes are more radiation resistant than those containing phototransistors. In the photodiode isolator the LED is responsible for essentially all the gamma-induced isolator degradation. The performance of phototransistor isolators depends strongly on the phototransistor bias, VCE, and the LED input current, ILED. At high ILED and low VCE where gamma-induced surface effects in the phototransistor are minimized, the degradation of the isolator is due primarily to the LED which is more sensitive than the LED in the photodiode isolator. In contrast, at low ILED and high VCE, gamma-induced surface damage in the phototransistor is the dominant effect and the isolator is quite sensitive to irradiation."
"An optimum technique has been devised for measuring radiation damage constants of LED's, which avoids \"injection annealing\" of the damage that can occur during post-irradiation evaluation. It is shown that the low current densities necessary to avoid this annealing may require that measurements be made at constant junction voltage, and may preclude the use of the reverse-charge-recovery technique for direct measurement of carrier lifetime. The correction necessary for the varying voltage drop across the diode series resistance is facilitated by the low measuring currents, and by a novel technique for the accurate measurement of diode series resistance at low currents. Precise measurement techniques permit damage constants to be evaluated by application of only a small radiation dose. Using this method, proton, neutron, and gamma damage constants have been evaluated for commercial (Texas Instruments TIXL-13) GaAs LED's. Agreement between the damage constant describing degradation at these low current densities and the higher levels used in practical applications has been verified."
"The performance of a variety of BARITT diode oscillators has been measured under transient ionizing radiation conditions. Two to five milliwatt cw silicon diode oscillators (Schottky and diffused injecting junctions) were exposed to 100 nanosecond pulses of 10 MeV electrons at dose rates between 107 and 1010 rads/sec. With these oscillators, the RF power is reduced at increasing dose rates and is quenched entirely during the radiation pulse at a dose rate dependent upon junction characteristics. The RF power remains quenched after the radiation pulse for approximately 500 nanoseconds in some diodes due to charge storage. The charge storage is related to the injection efficiency of the injecting contact, increasing in duration as the injection efficiency increases. Besides this temporary stored charge, no aftereffects were observed in any of the diodes."
"This paper summarizes the results of a major test program which involved the measurement of the pulse power failure thresholds of 41 integrated circuit types, representing seven logic families. The pulse widths used in these tests range from 0.1 microsecond to 10 microseconds. The failure threshold data have been grouped by logic family and test terminal to form failure categories. A simple failure model has been developed which is useful in predicting the failure thresholds of untested devices."
"In this paper we develop expressions which describe breakdown, negative resistance and latch characteristics for a common emitter transistor when exposed to simultaneous conducted EMP and ionizing radiation. These expressions are derived from a modified Ebers-Moll model and show that common emitter breakdown voltage is reduced, latch (or sustaining voltage) remains unchanged, and that the negative resistance characteristics are changed. Using the modified Ebers-Moll model good agreement between predicted and observed circuit response is demonstrated when the circuits are exposed to a rising collector voltage (due to EMP) and simultaneous ionizing (gamma) radiation."
 "Electrical pulse burnout thresholds were measured in GaAs, GaAsP, and GaP light-emitting diodes (LEDs) by studying the degradation in light output and the change in I-V characteristics both during the pulse and in the steady state. Pulse widths ranging from a few hundred nsec to 100 μsec were used. Light output degradation was the most sensitive parameter and was used to determine the thresholds. Just above threshold, damage is caused by an increase in generation-recombination current in the space-charge retion. This current is non-radiative and the light output drops, but the damage is not catastrophic. At higher power, the junction burns through and shunt resistance paths are formed which more drastically degrade the light output. The experimental data match reasonably with the theoretical Wunsch-Bell/Tasca model if a burnout area of 1/10 the junction area is assumed. Both the adiabatic term (At-1) and the heat flow term (Bt-½) contribute in all devices, and the equilibrium term (C) contributes in some GaAsP devices. The scatter in the data for GaAs devices is greater than that for GaAsP devices, apparently because the former types have a significant fraction of mavericks with lower-than-normal thresholds. The use of LEDs to examine electrical pulse burnout is advantageous because the light output is quite sensitive to damage and the combined measurement of optical and electrical properties provides additional information about the mechanisms involved."
"The response of Al-SiO2-Si (n-type) MOS capacitors to pulsed 30-MeV electron irradiation has been investigated for both positive and negative bias on the field plate. For samples under positive bias, the charge-transfer signal consists of two components. The first is due to carrier pairs generated in the oxide, which are swept at sufficiently high applied oxide fields to the electrodes before they can be trapped or can recombine, and consequently saturates at high fields. This component has been previously observed for low-energy irradiation which essentially did not penetrate completely through the oxide. The second component is approximately linear in applied field and is interpreted as being due to electron injection from the silicon substrate. Under negative bias, for which the interface of the silicon substrate is inverted, an entirely different transient behavior is seen. A large charge-transfer signal is observed during a 1-μsec irradiating pulse. The magnitude of the total charge transferred is independent of bias voltage for sufficiently large biases and has only a very weak dependence on dose. The source of this signal, which for 100-rad(Si) pulses is over an order of magnitude greater than that observed under positive bias conditions, has been shown to be due to motion of hole-electron pairs generated in the depletion region of the silicon."
"In designing or analyzing electronic circuits for nuclear radiation hardness it is important to know the response of components and their failure levels due to high level current pulses. Theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted on film, carbon composition and wirewound resistors to determine the power or voltage required to cause failure as a function of pulse width. Certain film resistors exhibit failure at the millijoule total energy level which is within the same energy range of concern for many semiconductor devices. Larger wattage carbon composition and wirewound resistors on the other hand were able to absorb tens of joules of energy without failure corresponding to tens of megawatts of power for 1 microsecond pulses. Simplified failure and response models are described."
"Tests examining possible synergistic effects of electrical pulses and ionizing radiation on transistors were performed and energy/power thresholds for transistor burnout determined. The effect of ionizing radiation on burnout thresholds was found to be minimal, indicating that electrical pulse testing in the absence of radiation produces burnout-threshold results which are applicable to IEMP studies. The conditions of ionized transistor junctions and radiation induced current surges at semiconductor device terminals are inherent in IEMP studies of electrical circuits."
"The prospects for obtaining better theoretical calculations of experimentally interesting electron interaction effects, over a wide range of electron energies, are now considerably improved through the development of models for valence electron excitation in simple insulators and through the availability of theoretical atomic generalized oscillator strengths for inner shell electron excitation in several low-Z atomic systems. We describe briefly the way in which this information may be used to calculate mean free paths, stopping powers, and electron slowing-down spectra in Al metal and the insulator Al2O3."
"Electron energy and charge albedos were obtained for Be, Al, Ti, Mo, Ta, and U targets over the range of incident energies from 0.1 to 1.0 MeV. In the case of Al, Ta, and U the measurements were extended down to approximately 25 keV. Measurements were made for incident angles from 0° (normal) to 60°, and in some cases 75°, in 15° increments. The results agree well with existing experimental data and with Monte Carlo predictions, except at low energies where the discrepancies are only partially understood."
"A theoretical model is described for calculating the number and average energy of ionizing events produced by x-rays in regions with characteristic dimensions ranging from mm to fractions of a μm. Microdosimetry theory is applied to estimate the variance of the event distribution and it is found that when device dimensions are in the μm range or less the distribution approaches lognormality. The model does not involve extensive calculations and uses only readily available data tabulations. It indicates that dose fluctuations could become significant if present trends towards smaller device elements continue."
"Analytical transport methods have been developed to predict photo-Compton currents (PCC) in many geometries. This paper presents the \"second generation\" status of these methods including: (1) a method of determining the azimuthal in addition to the polar angular dependence; (2) an extension to higher order expansions which more accurately predict angular distributions; (3) more accurate back yields of low atomic number materials at high photon energies; and (4) more accurate electron scattering cross sections. The analytical methods have now evolved to the point that almost any quantity associated with vacuum photoemission can generally be calculated to within 20% agreement with Monte Carlo predictions and experimental data."
"The electronic effects on an irradiated one dimensional dielectric-metal slab structure have been modeled. The effects considered include: radiation driven currents, charge deposition, applied electric fields, deposited charge fields, field driven conductivity currents and radiation induced photoconductivity. The time and spatial dependence of the electric current density, charge density and electric field are determined. The time dependence of the replacement current flowing between metal slabs is calculated. Results are given for x-rays of energies from 30 to 1250 keV. Interesting results predict electric fields > 106 V/cm, time varying replacement currents which even reverse sign, and multipole electric fields in one dimension. Experimental measurements produce time dependent replacement currents under 60Co irradiation."
"Dose profiles in silicon and polyethylene next to gold-silicon and gold-polyethylene interfaces, due to x-rays of energies between 10 and 2000 keV, have been calculated using the POEM Monte Carlo electron transport code. By calculating separately the transport of Compton, K-, M-and L-photoelectric, and Auger electrons generated in the gold, each contribution to the total energy fluence profile was obtained and fit to the functional form A exp (Bx+Cx2+Dx3). Differentiating this form and summing over all source contributions led to excellent analytic representations of the dose profile next to gold for energies below 200 keV. Above 200 keV the dose profiles for two directions of photon irradiation were obtained by the method of Chadsey. Curves of relative dose and relative mean dose as a function of x-ray energy for several distances from the interface were calculated for the first time."
"A procedure is established for determining the effective device radiation dose from the equivalent silicon ionizing dose as measured by a silicon calorimeter, provided the incident spectrum and device dimensions are known. Experimental data is obtained from a silicon transistor packaged in Kovar and Kovar/ gold TO-5 cans and subjected to low-and high-energy photon radiation environments. The experimental results are compared to depth-dose profiles calculated by the SANDYL radiation transport code. The procedure correlates device photocurrent data between radiation environments with different photon energies."
"Local dose enhancement caused by neutron capture in tantalum devices has been predicted but not previously measured. An experiment is reported in which the dose due to conversion electrons and sub-MeV photons resulting from neutron capture in Ta is compared to the dose from high-energy photons. For measurements on a thin Ta foil using a silicon surface barrier detector and incident neutrons in the resonance region (thermal to 500 eV), the dose enhancement ratio (dose due to all secondary radiations/dose due to super-MeV photons) was found to be 4.7 ± 0.3."
"The thermomechanical response of five structures of varying complexity to pulsed electron beams is measured by use of a laser interferometer arrangement. The five structures are (1) a thin (uniformly irradiated) aluminum disk, (2) an aluminum disk thicker than the range of the incident electrons, (3) a two layer (kovar-silicon) laminate, (4) a three layer (glasskovar-silicon) laminate, and (5) a simple inlaid structure consisting of a kovar cup filled with glass and topped with a silicon chip. The experimental results for these structures are compared with calculations performed using the computer code TWODY3. For the first and fourth structures, the calculated and measured responses agree qualitatively, but the magnitude of the responses do not. More specifically, when the peak displacement of the initial, one dimensional, responses are compared, the experimental values are about 30 percent lower. For the first structure, the disagreement is probably the result of the inability to accurately match the energy deposition profile used in the calculation with the experimental conditions. (This condition exists only for very thin samples.) For the fourth structure, charge buildup in the glass layer ultimately leads to its failure during the experimental tests. These effects are not considered in the calculations so the disagreement is expected. For the second, third, and fifth structures, the measured and calculated responses agree very well (a few percent while experimental error is 15 percent) during the initial response and well into multidimensional response portion."
"Calculations of the gamma-ray energy deposition spectrum have been performed for a silicon ionization dosimeter based on a silicon surface barrier detector. The technique used was a coupled photon-electron transport calculation using the three-dimensional Monte Carlo code, SANDYL. Comparison of calculated pulse-height spectra and measurements of standard calibrated gamma sources demonstrated the need to take into account the nonuniformity of the charge collection efficiency in the device. To this end, measurements were made of the radial dependence of the charge collection efficiency and sensitive volume. These results yielded an improved model and improved agreement between calcullation and experiment."
"The mathematical theory of bipolar transistor operation is founded upon conclusions drawn primarily from one-dimensional models for this semiconductor device. These models are of varying complexity. The simple models offer the advantage of computational ease and, thereby, represent practical engineering tools. Other, more complex models require extensive computer time; these models are more applicable to research investigations into problems relating to the theory of transistor operation. Using statistical methods of analysis it is shown that many elementary models for transistor operation provide satisfactory agreement with experiment. A similar degree of agreement is seldom (if ever) obtained for the current gain or switching speed. It is suggested that this current gain problem arises from emitter region mechanisms for which there is only limited understanding. Additionally, it is suggested that this same problem has important implications in the theory of I2L logic structures."
"The results of gamma irradiation (both break-out transistors and complete microcircuits) lead us to conclude that circuits produced using this process are very tolerant to this type of hostile environment. This would indicate good surface passivation resulting in low surface leakage currents. The circuits are reasonably tolerant to neutron radiation. As expected, the transistor current gains are degraded. However, the circuits are still functional after exposure to 1 × 1015 n/cm2. The probable reasons for this tolerance are (1) the construction necessary to produce such high speed circuitry results in a very narrow base region with a small emitter-base depletion region and (2) Emitter Coupled Logic operates at higher currents (than TTL for example) and the gain is degraded less (relatively) at higher currents (and thus higher operating frequencies). The above conclusion regarding higher tolerance at higher frequency is true for ECL circuits in general and this differential configuration in particular. However, it is not valid for high-speed circuits in general. If transistors are switched at higher current levels for higher frequencies, they would probably be more tolerant to neutron radiation. Each high speed logic family will have to be evaluated on its own merits and for particular applications for use in radiation environments. Another result that would be desirable is the transient response of the complete microcircuit to ionizing radiation pulses."
"The effects of neutron and total dose gamma irradiations on the electrical characteristics of an integrated injection logic (I2L) cell and an I2L multiple inverter circuit were investigated. These units were designed and fabricated to obtain circuit development information and did not have radiation hardness as a goal. The following parameters of the test structures were measured as a function of total dose and neutron fluence: the dc common-base current gain of the lateral pnp transistor; the dc common-emitter current gain of the vertical npn transistor; the forward current-voltage characteristics of the injector-substrate junction, and the propagation delay versus power dissipation per gate for the multiple inverter circuit. The limitations of the present test structures in a radiation environment and possible hardening techniques are discussed."
"Integrated Injection Logic (I2 L) is a new highdensity, low power bipolar LSI technology that offers major performance advantages over other bipolar and MOS/LSI technologies. Results are presented on the experimentally-determined radiation sus ceptibility of developmental unhardened I2L LSI logic cells in terms of neutron-induced displacement damage, ionizing - dose-induced surface effects and transient photoresponse."
"A hierarchy of modeling procedures has been developed for MOS transistors, circuit blocks, and integrated circuits which include the effects of total dose radiation and photocurrent response. The models were developed for use with the SCEPTRE circuit analysis program, but the techniques are suitable for other modern computer aided analysis programs. The modeling hierarchy permits the designer or analyst to select the level of modeling complexity consistent with circuit size, parametric information, and accuracy requirements. Improvements have been made in the implementation of important second order effects in the transistor MOS model, in the definition of MOS building block models, and in the development of composite terminal models for MOS integrated circuits."
"Sapphire photocurrent is the dominant transient radiation response of CMOS/SOS circuits at high dose rates. Radiation-induced leakage current flowing through this photoresistive path accounts for most of the SOS transistor drain photocurrent observed experimentally. Sapphire photoconduction effects were modeled by incorporating radiation-induced linear photoconductance models in parallel with the channel conductances of the MOS transistors. This approach was used to predict the performance of CMOS/SOS NAND gates at high dose rates. NAND gates designed in accordance with optimum-W geometry rules for sapphire photocurrent compensation are predicted to have symmetrical dose-rate failure thresholds exceeding 1010 rads/sec. Radiation test results from experimental CMOS/SOS NAND gates have demonstrated dose-rate failure thresholds in the range from 2 × 1010 to 1011 rads/sec. The maximum achievable dose-rate failure threshold is approximately inversely proportional to fan-in. Consequently, more-radiation-resistant CMOS/SOS digital integrated circuits can be designed using CMOS/SOS NAND gates having limited fan-in. This design guide is practical, since it presents no serious problem with respect to either die size or circuit complexity."
"Tests were conducted to characterize a fully decoded 256 bit PMNOS memory in a nuclear environment, These tests were as follows: (1) transient photo-current tests using 20 ns and 100 ns electron pulses from the AFCRL Linac, (2) transient annealing tests using 4,5 μs electron pulses from the same Linac and also 365 μs to 2.5 ms gamma pulses from the Aberdeen Pulse Reactor with doses up to 6 x 104 rads (Si) and neutron fluences up to 2.6 x 1013n/cm2 pulse, (3) survivability tests using 20 ns gamma pulse from the AFCRL Flash X-ray, and (4) total dose using Cobalt-60 source at ECOM, Evans Laboratory. The results show that predictions of failure levels based on measurement made on the elementary devices are reasonably accurate. In addition, the results show that total does hardness levels of 3 x 105 rads (Si) can be achieved without the use of hardened insulators. Most of the various failure levels were determined by the PMOS radiation effects."
 "The total dose effects of gamma radiation on an unhardened 256-stage linear CCD imager have been investigated. Key device parameters were monitored and the primary failure mechanisms identified. Additional structural design rules for radiation hard CCD's were formulated. The performance of a threshold insensitive input technique was evaluated."
 "A diode model has been constructed which simulates second breakdown and which allows for the calculation of junction temperature as a function of time in the reverse region. The model was generated for the NET-2 circuit analysis code, and also includes avalanche breakdown. Second breakdown is assumed to begin at the critical temperature at which the resistivity is a maximum; at this point the junction area is caused to rapidly decrease, causing an increase in the temperature and the thermally generated leakage current. This results in the rapid voltage drop characteristic of second breakdown. With the addition of temperature calculations in the forward region and capacitive effects, it is anticipated that the model will be useful for predicting second breakdown for general inputs, and in general circuit configurations."
"The transient response of both junction isolated (JI) and dielectrically isolated (DI) CMOS circuits has been investigated in three FXR environments of differing energy spectrums. The offset recovery times have been measured and analyzed for both structures. It is shown that while the DI circuit (HD4007) did not exhibit a four layer type latchup action, its transient response persisted for a time longer than is expected for this type of device. A possible mechanism for this observed response is developed and discussed. JI circuits (CD4007) exposed under the same conditions exhibited four layer device action and one sample at low spectral energies latched-up. The conditions for the latchup to occur including the four layer device paths are discussed. Finally, the dependence of the x-ray transient response on the spectral energy is considered. For the lower energy FXR source, latchup was observed in a CD4007 sample. This latchup was not observed at more than double the dose rate when a high energy FXR was used. This result is attributed to dose enhancement, and a device enhancement factor may also be involved. The dose enhancement factor is estimated from the work of Long, and points up the importance of accounting for the spectral energy content in simulating a given nuclear threat spectrum."
"Electron and proton damage coefficients have been determined for low resistivity silicon based on minority-carrier lifetime measurements on bulk material and diffusion length measurements on solar cells. Major observations made and conclusions reached are the following. 1) Diffusion-length damage coefficients (KL) increase with decreasing resistivity (ρ) for boron-doped silicon. For 0.5-, 1.0-, and 2.5-MeV electron bombardment, empirical fits to experimental data can be approximately expressed as KL ∝ ρ-2/3 for 0.1 ≤ ρ ≤ 20 ohm-cm. For 10-MeV proton bombardment, an empirical fit of the form KL ∝ ρ-0.44 was found to describe the data reasonably well. 2) The dependence of damage coefficient on resistivitycanbe qualitatively accounted for quite well using a two-level Hall-Shockley-Read model. 3) Damage coefficients for solar cells were observed to be larger than their bulk-material counterparts. 4) Bulk samples and solar cells prepared from float-zone material were generally observed to be more radiation tolerant than their Czochralski counter-parts at all resistivities examined. 5) No dependence of damage coefficient on dislocation density was apparent for 0.1 ohm-cm bulk samples and solar cells."
"The correlation of displacement effects produced by electrons, protons, and neutrons in silicon is studied. Available data from the literature is employed. In particular the scope of the study is limited to the degradation of excess carrier lifetime and device electrical parameters directly related to it. The degree to which displacement effects may be correlated in order to predict semiconductor device response based on response data to another type of radiation is discussed. Useful ranges of the correlation factors (KT ratios) as a function of device majority carrier type, device resistivity, and injection level are presented. A significant dependence on injection level for the correlation factors is found."
 "Anomalies in communication satellite operation have been caused by the unexpected triggering of digital circuits. Interactions with galactic cosmic rays were investigated as a mechanism for a number of these events. The mechanism assumed was the charging of the base-emitter capacitance of sensitive transistors to the turn-on voltage. The calculation of the cosmic ray event rate required the determination of transistor parameters, charge collection efficiencies, and the number of sensitive transistors. The sensitive transistors were determined by analyzing the results of a scanning electron microscope experiment. Calculations with iron cosmic rays resulted in an event rate of 3.1 × 10-3 per transistor per year, in reasonable agreement with the observed rate of 1.5 × 10-3."
"The damage mechanisms resulting from normally incident low-energy proton irradiation on the back side of standard n/p silicon solar cells have been investigated, and an evaluation was performed of cells modified to better withstand back irradiation. The damage effects produced by the low-energy rear-incident protons resulted in the formation of an additional junction at the back contact and an increase in effective series resistance, indicating the removal of majority carriers at the damaged region. The proton irradiation caused an injection level dependence of the spectral response; the spectral response degradation at high injection levels was greater than at low injection levels. The results of the evaluation of the modified cells indicate that the n/p solar cells with a p+-doped-back surface are less sensitive to normally rear-incident low-energy proton irradiation. Sensitivity to this type radiation also decreases with increasing cell thickness."
"A computerized transverse-axial x-ray scanning tomography system has been constructed and operated using inexpensive and readily available components. The system is used only for the scanning of phantoms and the image reconstruction is carried out on an IBM 360/75. Images reconstructed from data taken by the device are able to resolve radiographic density variations of about 1/2% over distances of 0.5 cm."
"A mathematical model of an inductive type liquid sodium level meter has been developed, which simulates behavior of the level meter in various environmental conditions. A test model was made to confirm experimentally the accuracy of the mathematical model. It was recognized that the mathematical model shows fairly well the behavior of an actual level meter. Error estimations were accomplished with this mathematical model. Errors are caused by the change of ambient temperature and by the surface tension of sodiumr."
"The gate noise from radiation induced defects in MOSFET's and JFET's has been studied for 24.8 MeV electron irradiations up to about 1 x 1016 e/cm2. The flicker noise increase induced in JFET's has been interpreted as due to the defect generation and recombination centers induced by radiation damage within the depletion layer. Finally, it is shown that the noise performance of JFET's is well applicable for high-intensity and high-level radiation detection."

"This revision added paragraphs on repeated circuits, selected and matched parts, and designation of deposited components on hybrid printed circuits. An appendix B was added covering the Item Designation system of IEC Publication 113-2. Supplement A of 1970 was incorporated into the text, along with minor clarifications and updating of references. Significant changes are marked by vertical black bars in the margin, adjacent to the changed text. The 1968 revision and its 1970 Supplement coordinated the title with the terms used in related standards, added the class letter U, identified names approved in the Federal Item Identification Guide (H6-1), and transferred the class letter list to IEEE Std 315 (ANSI Y32.2). The original issue of this standard was prepared by Subcommittee 16 on Reference Designations, appointed by Sectional Committee Y32 on Graphic Symbols and Designations for the purpose of preparing standard reference designations in the field of electrical and electronic equipment. Early work on reference designations, of the type herein standardized as the Unit Numbering Method, was done by the Symbols Committee of the Institute of Radio Engineers and was published in 1949 as Standards on Designations for Electrical, Electronic and Mechanical Parts and their Symbols, 49 IRE 21.SI. In 1951 the U.S. Department of Defense issued MIL-STD-16 which closely resembled the IRE Standard and acknowledged the pioneering work of the IRE Symbols Committee in this field. In order to minimize confusion, intensive and successful efforts have since been made to coordinate the two standards throughout their subsequent revisions. The work on this standard was greatly facilitated by the constant participation of representatives of the Department of Defense and the IEEE Symbols Committee. As in MIL-SfD-16C, the original Block Numbering Method of assigning reference designations has been deleted in favor of the more flexible and universally applicable Unit Numbering Method, which is retained, with minor modifications, in Section 4 of this standard. The explanation of the Block Numbering Method appearing as Appendix A does not form a part of this standard, but is retained for reference in connection with existing equipment on which it was used. The subcommittee was assigned the task of standardizing means for physically locating, through a form of reference designation, the parts and divisions of an equipment. The Location Numbering Method in Section 5 and the Location Coding Method in Section 6 of this standard are based on existing industry practices which have been successfully used to facilitate manufacture and service of complex apparatus by providing such locating means. They are especially useful in designs making multiple use of identical or closely similar parts of subassemblies."

  "We show the existence of polynomials with 0-1 coefficients that are hard to evaluate even when arbitrary preconditioning is allowed. Further we show that there are power series with 0-1 coefficients such that their initial segments are hard to evaluate."
"In this paper, an investigation of the parallel arithmetic complexity of matrix inversion, solving systems of linear equations, computing determinants and computing the characteristic polynomial of a matrix is reported. The parallel arithmetic complexity of solving equations has been an open question for several years. The gap between the complexity of the best algorithms (2n + 0(1), where n is the number of unknowns/ equations) and the only proved lower bound (2 log n (All logarithms in this paper are of base two.)) was huge. The first breakthrough came when Csanky reported that the parallel arithmetic complexity of all these four problems has the same growth rate and exhibited an algorithm that computes these problems in 2n - O(log2n) steps. It will be shown in the sequel that the parallel arithmetic complexity of all these four problems is upper bounded by O(log2n) and the algorithms that establish this bound use a number of processors polynomial in n. This disproves I. Munro's conjecture."
"In parallel computation two approaches are common; namely unbounded parallelism and bounded parallelism. In this paper both approaches will be considered. The problem of unbounded parallelism is studied in section II and some lower and upper bounds on different connectivity problems for directed and undirected graphs are presented. In section III we mention bounded parallelism and three different k-parallel graph search techniques, namely k-depth search, breadth depth search, and breadth-first search. Each algorithm is analyzed with respect to the optimal serial algorithm. It is shown that for sufficiently dense graphs the parallel breadth first search technique is very close to the optimal bound. Techniques for searching sparse graphs are also discussed."
"A model is defined in which questions concerning delay bounded asynchronous parallel systems may be investigated. Persistence and determinacy are introduced for this model. These two conditions are shown to be sufficient to guarantee that a synchronous execution policy can be relaxed to an asynchronous execution policy with no change to the result of the computation. In addition, the asynchronous execution time is only (D+1) times the synchronous execution time, where D is the delay bound. A wide class of recognition problems is identified which can be solved by linear asynchronous structures. Also, it is shown that synchronization problems, similar to the \"firing squad synchronization problem,\" cannot be solved by delay bounded asynchronous systems."
"The proof theory of structured programming insofar as concerned with flow of control is investigated. Various proof rules for the while, repeat-until and simple iteration statements - all essentially variants of Hoare's original while rule - are analyzed with respect to their soundness and adequacy. Next, a recently proposed proof rule for recursive procedures due to Dijkstra is - after correction - shown to be a simple instance of Scott's induction rule. Finally, Manna & Pnueli's rule for total correctness of the while statement is formally justified using the Hitchcock & Park theory of program termination based on well-founded relations."
"Given partially ordered sets (posets) P and Q, it is often useful to construct maps g:P→Q which are chain-continuous: least upper bounds (supremums) of nonempty linearly ordered subsets are preserved. Chaincontinuity is analogous to topological continuity and is generally much more difficult to verify than isotonicity: the preservation of the order relation. This paper introduces the concept of an extension basis: a subset B of P such that any isotone f:B→Q has a unique chain-continuous extension g:P→Q. Two characterizations of the chain-complete posets which have extension bases are obtained. These results are then applied to the problem of constructing an extension basis for the poset [P→Q] of chain-continuous maps from P to Q, given extension bases for P and Q. This is not always possible, but it becomes possible when a mild (and independently motivated) restriction is imposed on either P or Q. A lattice structure is not needed. Finally, we consider extension bases which can be recursively listed and derive a recently established theorem as a corollary."
"This paper considers simple LISP-like languages for the recursive definition of functions, focusing upon the connections between formal computation rules for calculation and the mathematical semantics of recursive definitions. A computation rule is correct when it is capable of computing the minimal fixpoint of a recursive definition. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the correctness of rules under (a) all possible interpretations and (b) particular interpretations."
 "In this note we show that the tape bounded complexity classes of languages over single letter alphabets are closed under complementation. We then use this result to show that there exists an infinite hierarchy of tape bounded complexity classes of sla languages between log n and log log n tape bounds. We also show that every infinite sla language recognizable on less than log n tape has infinitely many different regular subsets, and, therefore, the set of primes in unary notation, P, requires exactly log n tape for its recognition and every infinite subset of P requires at least log n tape."
"We prove that an algorithm for selecting both the minimum and maximum element from an unordered set is minimean optimal. This algorithm had already been shown to be minimax optimal. The circumstances in which the same algorithm is optimum for both norms leads to a conjecture relating both norms. The method of proof utilizes a new idea in the theory of sorting optimality, namely degree information of the Hasse digraphs."
"We present a data structure, based upon a stratified binary tree, which enables us to manipulate on-line a priority queue whose priorities are selected from the interval 1...n, with an average and worst case processing time of O(log log n) per instruction. The structure is used to obtain a mergeable heap whose time requirements are about as good."
 "We consider expressions whose arguments are relations and whose operators are chosen from among ∪, ο, *, and -1. We further assume that operands may be designated \"sparse\" or \"dense\", in a manner to be made formal subsequently. Our aim is to determine whether the evaluation of such an expression is (a) as hard as general transitive closure (b) as hard as transitive closure for sparse graphs. (c) as hard as connected components of an undirected graph."
 "This work presents a new efficient algorithm for finding a maximum matching in an arbitrary graph. Two implementations are suggested, the complexity of the first is O(n2.5) and the complexity of the second is O(m√n·log n) where n, m are the numbers of the vertices and the edges in the graph."
 "To within a constant factor, only two complexity classes of complete binary bases exist. We show that they are separated by at most O(nlog310), or about O(n2.095), complementing a result of Khrapchenko that establishes an order n2 lower bound."
"It is shown that there is a sequence of languages E1, E2,... such that every correct prefix parser (one which detects errors at the earliest possible moment, e.g., LR or LL parsers) for En has size 2cn, yet a deterministic PDA recognizing En exists and has size O(n2). There is another easily described sequence of languages N1,N2,... for which Nn has a nondeterministic PDA of size O(n2) but no deterministic PDA of size less than 2cn. It is shown moreover, that this latter exponential gap can be made arbitrarily large for different sequences of languages."
"In this paper Valiant's decision procedure for equivalence of deterministic finite-turn pushdown machines is improved upon. The improved equivalence test is: Given two mahcines, one constructs a pushdown machine that simulates them simultaneously and accepts a string iff it is accepted by exactly one of them. The given machines are equivalent iff the simulating pda accepts the empty language. The simulating machine uses its pushdown store to hold the contents of the stores of the two simulated machines. In order ot prevent the tops of the two stores to get too far apart the simulating machine sometimes replaces the contents of one of the stores. Valiant 1,2 has proved the existence of a suitable function which determines the replacements. The crux of this paper is an algorithm for constructing such a function. The existence of such an algorithm enables us to calculate an upper bound on the time complexity of the improved algorithm. We obtain the results that equivalence of deterministic finite-turn pushdown automata can be tested in super-exponential time and equivalence of deterministic two-tape automata can be tested in exponential time."
"We show that the languages generated by a constrained form of Chomsky's transformational grammars characterize the languages recognized by Turing machines in deterministic exponential (2cn) time. The constraints on the transformational grammars are satisfied by many, though not all, known grammars in linguistic practice. We also give a simple algebraic characterization of the same class of languages and use it for the linguistic characterization."
 "A number of seemingly unrelated problems involving the proximity of N points in the plane are studied, such as finding a Euclidean minimum spanning tree, the smallest circle enclosing the set, k nearest and farthest neighbors, the two closest points, and a proper straight-line triangulation. For most of the problems considered a lower bound of O(N log N) is shown. For all of them the best currently-known upper bound is O(N2) or worse. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a single geometric structure, called the Voronoi diagram, which can be constructed rapidly and contains all of the relevant proximity information in only linear space. The Voronoi diagram is used to obtain O(N log N) algorithms for all of the problems."
"Bin packing and dynamic allocation problems hold an important place both in theoretical computer science and in practical issues arising in computer applications and operations research. While major analytic advances have been made for the 1-dimension case, optimal results for 2-dimensional problems have been elusive. As a model for analysis of various multidimensional bin packing and cutting stock problems, we consider the following question. Let be an arbitrary finite family of squares of total area at most unity; what is the smallest rectangle into which any such family can be packed without overlap? We answer this with the following optimal result: 1) any unit family can be packed into a rectangle with sides 2/√3 and √2; 2) any other rectangle with this packing property has larger area. The proof of this is rather lengthy and technical. We therefore restrict this presentation to a general discussion of the methods used and an outline of the major cases together with some specific examples."
 "A proposed method for testing printed circuit boards for the existence of possible (undesired) short circuits transforms the test minimization problem into one of finding minimum vertex colorings of certain special graphs, called line-of-sight graphs. Under certain assumptions on the possible types of short circuits, we analyze the structure of such graphs and show that a well-known and efficient algorithm can be used to color them with a small number of colors. In particular, we show that no more than 5, 8, or 12 colors (depending on the particular assumptions) will ever be required for such a graph, independent of the number of vertices. Thus, in such cases, the potential advantage of the proposed method over exhaustive testing could be considerable."
"A very primitive version of Gotlieb's timetable problem is shown to be NP-complete, and therefore all the common timetable problems are NP-complete. A polynomial time algorithm, in case all teachers are binary, is shown. The theorem that a meeting function always exists if all teachers and classes have no time constraints is proved. The multi-commodity integral flow problem is shown to be NP-complete even if the number of commodities is two. This is true both in the directed and undirected cases. Finally, the two commodity real flow problem in undirected graphs is shown to be solvable in polynomial time. The time bound is O(|v|2|E|)."

"Continuous casting-the formation of billets, blooms and slabs direct from the liquid metal-was first attempted in 1856 when Bessemer poured molten steel between water-cooled rolls to try to form continuous sheets of thin plate.

During the last few years notable successes have been achieved in the engineering and supply of vehicle test plant based on rotating electric machines controlled by thyristor converters or, in some cases, Ward Leonard sets"
"From its emergence as a prospective power source at the turn of the last century, the induction motor has certainly become the work horse of industry. Developing together with electricity generation, initially as a single-phase machine, it was a process of natural evolution through briefly the 2-phase model to the now almost universal 3-phase machine"
"In its broadest sense, management is the ability to define a task, to analyse the complexities of it, to allocate priorities to the problems involved, to prepare against the more insurable pitfalls, and to see the task through to a successful conclusion. This article discusses the faults of management and the management system, and puts forward suggestions that will help remedy the situation and ease the present economic problems in Britain"
"The railway-freight business is well suited to the application of computer technology because of its widespread activity with variations in both flow and volume. Four years ago British Rail decided to adopt a computerised information system, known as TOPS, to improve the efficiency of the movement of freight. This article gives a brief history of TOPS, a breakdown of the equipment used in the system and the method used to integrate it with British Rail's freight service"

Undoubtedly, the global answer is the use of a nationwide resource sharing system, but this article shows that a fairly cheap local system may be easily developed"
"Digital systems, while relatively novel only a few years ago, are already commonplace. In the realm of broadcasting, several developments have taken place recently culminating in the provision of digital data transmission into the home by way of the Oracle and Ceefax systems"
"Many relatively small control systems now involve sophisticated techniques, and digital computers are being used in larger numbers.

                        "The distribution system is the final link in the chain of supply from generator to consumer, but while it may be the last link it is by no means the least important. An individual supply may be small and insignificant in cost in itself, but to that consumer it is all important, and, with some 13 million consumers in Britain, the total expenditure on the distribution system is highly significant"

         "Industry is well geared to the production of cables using oil-impreganted paper, and service experience with it, whilst not being perfect, has been extremely good. So why should a change be made from the well tried oil-impregnated paper to synthetic insulation? Essentially, the synthetic insulants offer lower dielectric loss, at least an order lower than oil-impregnated paper, relative permittivities ranging from 1 to 2.5, and extremely low moisture absorption"
"It has been known for some 40 years that one of the most effective ways of interrupting an a.c. circuit is to do so by means of contacts in vacuum. Unlike all other interrupters there is no gas in the arc, only metal vapour which condenses very rapidly as the current falls to zero, giving a most predictable performance and a very fast rise of electric strength between opening contacts. During the last decade, high-power interrupters have been developed, and vacuum circuit breakers are commercially available. Their advantages are becoming increasingly apparent over a widening application"

 "In February 1975, the British Government gave consent for the construction of two new nuclear power stations: a 4-unit plant at Sizewell, Suffolk, for the CEGB, and a 2-unit plant at Torness in East Lothian for the SSEB. These stations will be the first to use the British-developed steam-generating heavy-water reactor following the long-awaited Government decision taken in 1974.

                       "Air-traffic control is parasitic on the air-transport industry, and hence faces the problem of adapting itself to changes in the environment over which it has little or no control. During the spectacular changes in air transport over the last 40 years, there has been a great deal of development but little fundamental change in the electronic tools used by a.t.c. The instrument landing system and secondary radar are both about 35 years old. Even if we are now using integrated circuits, it is a.t.c. which has evolved around the electronic aids, rather than the other way round"

"With the increasing industrialisation that has been taking place in many overseas countries during the last decade, the demand for heavy electrical plant has multiplied. British manufacturers have been in the forefront of those supplying this equipment, and, as a result, they have built up considerable expertise in designing and building this plant, to meet the widely varying conditions encountered in these countries. This article discusses transformers suitable for overseas installations particularly where onerous conditions prevail. Some comments are also made on the benefits of choosing standard transformers and on transporting them on long overland routes"
"The principle of containing electrical apparatus within an enclosure of sufficient strength to withstand an internal explosion without igniting an explosive mixture outside the enclosure has been used for many years. BS 229, 'Flameproof enclosure of electrical apparatus', was first published in 1926, and, with four revisions and numerous amendments, served British industry so well that it was adopted by countries throughout the world. What has changed since then?"
"For over 100 years, engineers have been utilising electric power for a wide variety of floodlighting applications, and although early experiments often had a very limited life, there is no doubt that they were spectacular. Today, there is a wealth of knowledge and experience to support engineers and architects when they design schemes for projects of all types, and there is also a comprehensive range of luminaires available to suit most applications. Nevertheless, each project brings its own particular problems, and success usually depends on the skill of those who seek to interpret the day-time appearance"
  "Applications for static-invertor power supplies can range from simple emergency-lighting systems to the more `complex needs of a computer system or process-control equipment. But behind each application is the question: `Is it cost-effective?'"

"Most car drivers have come to expect reliable, comfortable motoring with the minimum of servicing and breakdowns. When one considers the vast number of components and subassemblies in the car and the rough treatment that we sometimes inflict on them, it says a lot for the standard of design and development of the present-day car that it does not break down more often"

It is not expected that universal agreement will ever occur on the advantages of unmanned vehicles over manned or vice versa. But the advantage of a system like Angus, where costs can be one-tenth of those involved in operating a competitive manned vehicle, is that it opens the door to many potential users with limited budgets"
"In the past, `seeing in the dark' has always been achieved by means of artificial light. Today, with the help of electronic aids, such as image-intensifier tubes and thermal-imaging systems, a human form can be discriminated in moonlight at a distance of up to 1500 m"

"Recent advances in integrated-circuit technology have resulted in increasingly powerful and compact computers. The pace of development has been so fast that other design areas run the risk of falling behind. The study reported in this article was carried out to ensure that thermal design was sustained at a comparably high level of development, and it illustrates some of the problems that arise when the cooling of a board assembly with i.c.s is analysed"
"Some 50 years ago, the first experiments were conducted that provided unequivocal evidence for the existence of an electrically charged region in the upper atmosphere capable of reflecting radio waves. In the last 25 years, there has been an explosive growth in our knowledge of the properties of the upper atmosphere arising from in situ measurements made with rockets and satellites."

These pulses are supplied through power transistors switched by digital controllers or computers, and the recent rapid growth in their application has been much influenced by the availability of cheap, digital integrated circuitry"
"Having declined steadily for the past 20 years, the British presence in Brazil is at last on the increase again. The newcomers are mostly the middle management and professional types with firm objectives and personal views. The prime objective of this article is to provide a broad outline of affairs in Brazil for those who are contemplating the trip. It may also serve to remove a little of the general ignorance about a part of the world so badly neglected by the media"

    "Let X be a random variable such that In [(X - μ)/σ] has a s-normal distribution with mean zero and variance one. Then X has a 3-parameter lognormal distribution with the third parameter, the shape parameter, fixed at unity. This paper presents the coefficients required to construct the best linear unbiased estimators (BLUEs) of μ and σ for samples of size fifteen and less. The variances and covariances of these estimators are provided. These estimators yield the BLUEs of the mean, standard deviation, and percentiles of X since these quantities are linear functions of μ and σ. Blom's estimators and maximum likelihood estimators compare favorably with the BLUEs."
"Hardware redundancy has been used in the design of fault-tolerant digital systems. A synthesis of protective hardware redundancy techniques is proposed and a generalized reliability model suitable for many fault-tolerant configurations is developed.

"An optimal inspection and replacement policy is discussed for a unit which assumes any one of several Markov states. The policy evaluation function is the s-expected cost-per-unit-time over an infinite time span. The problem is formulated as a semi-Markov decision process with a modified policy-improvement routine. Some properties of the optimal policy are discussed, for example, the control limit rule holds and the inspection time interval becomes shorter as degradation progresses."
 "This paper presents optimum accelerated life test plans for estimating a simple linear relationship between a stress and the median of product life which has a s-normal or lognormal distribution when the data are analyzed before all test units fail. Also, plans with equal numbers of test units at equally spaced test stresses are compared with the optimum plans. The plans are illustrated with a temperature-accelerated life test of electrical insulation."
 "This paper presents charts for optimum accelerated life-test plans for estimating a simple linear relationship between an accelerating stress and product life, which has a Weibull or smallest extreme value distribution, when the data are to be analyzed before all tests units fail. The plans show that one need not run all test units to failure and that more units ought to be tested at low test stresses than at high ones. The plans are illustrated with a voltage-accelerated life test of an electrical insulating fluid."
"This paper develops a technique for allocating the parameters, repair time and failure rate, to each component of a system at the lowest possible cost. The allocations are subject to the constraint of a required availability. To make an analytic solution possible, the assumptions of constant failure rates, s-independent components, series system, and no multiple failures were made. Each component is assumed to have a hyperbolic cost function associated with changing its failure rate and its repair time. A Lagrange Multiplier method was used to solve the problem."
 "Part-two uses regenerative processes to develop very general expressions for the reliability and for the point-availability of a system composed of two s-identical, repairable items working in warm redundancy. It is assumed that: a) the failure rate is arbitrary in the operating state, but constant in the reserve state, b) the repair rates are arbitrary, c) the system has only one repair crew and has no preventive maintenance, d) switching is perfect. The results for this model are then successively simplified to cover some well known particular cases."

   "The life of an airborne Air Data computer and some of its components have been observed in the field and in the laboratory. This paper treats 3 aspects of the reliability. Part 1 shows the relationship of predicted to actual MTBF and explains some seasonal fluctuations in actual MTBF. Monthly and yearly fluctuations are also explored. Part 2 shows some effects of workmanship-in-repair on reliability growth. The repair procedure was changed and the reliability gradually improved over a long period of time. Part 3 treats one of the components, a wirewound potentiometer, in some detail. A failure analysis and an improvement program are described."
 "This expository paper presents simple least squares methods for analyzing accelerated life test data with the inverse power law model, when all test units are run to failure. These methods are illustrated with accelerated test data on time to break-down of an insulating fluid."
"Majority voted redundant systems are widely used. A reliability model is developed and analyzed for N-tuple Modular Redundancy-NMR: (n + 1)-out-of-(2n + 1)-where the units are subject to stuck-at-0, stuck-at-1 or stuck-at-X failures and where failures can occur in a mutually compensatory manner. A reconfiguration of the NMR redundancy, the NMR/Simplex strategy, is proposed and evaluated and its model shown to be included in the general model for the compensated NMR."
 "This paper presents a reliability assessment procedure that systematically combines complete system binomial test data with lower level binomial test data obtained from either partial system or component tests. The procedure uses beta prior distributions of all reliabilities, Bayes theorem, and probability moments. The result is a posterior distribution of system reliability that can be used to determine Bayes point and interval estimates. The beta prior distributions evolve from data on predecessor systems similar to the system in question and engineering knowledge about what the various test-alternatives measure."
"This paper presents a numerical procedure for computing Bayes confidence intervals for the availability of a series or parallel system consisting of several statistically independent 2-state subsystems each having exponential distributions of life and repair time. The present results 1) provide a useful generalization of a previous result in which test data were limited to ``snap-shot'' observations on the subsystems operating states; 2) allow conventional life-test data for estimating the exponential parameters. The methods are suited to numerical evaluation using electronic computers as shown by particular examples."
"A decision-theoretic approach is proposed for bad-data elimination in parameter estimation. A linear measurement model with unknown additive noise having zero mean is considered and the noise distribution is assumed to be symmetrical and absolutely continuous. The partial covariance of the measurement random variable is considered to be constrained, and its minimum covariance and unbiasedness are chosen as criteria of goodness for the estimator. Using game-theory, a soft-limiter is shown to be optimal. It is also established that in the presence of bad data, performance of the proposed scheme is superior, and in its absence comparable, to that of linear estimators."
 "The robustness of reliability predictions based on the exponential failure law is investigated under possible deviations within the Weibull family of failure distributions. Regions of robustness are provided for parallel systems of N identical components, N = 1(1)15; i.e., regions in the space of the Weibull shape parameter, within which one may safely use the exponential prediction procedure and have no more than a prespecified error."
"An interconnected model is developed, whereby system reliability is studied from both the standpoint of the probability of failure and also the expected value of unserved load. Explicit algorithms (for use on a digital computer) are presented for the calculation of both of these values. Unlike a previous model, this one involves summing over the failure states, thereby allowing the study of each of these aspects of reliability; it also takes into account tie-line limitations. Interconnections could produce a more reliable pair of systems than an expansion would."
 "The reliability of a complex system was optimized by a new approach for implementing the sequential unconstrained minimization technique (SUMT) with the aid of Hooke and Jeeves pattern search and heuristic programming. Two optimization problems were considered. In the first, the system reliability was maximized subject to a nonlinear weight constraint. In the second, the weight of the system was minimized without violating the requirements of the minimal system reliability and the minimum reliability for each component. The sensitivities of the system reliability and that of the system weight to the reliability of each component were determined under optimal conditions."
"Reliability of a component can be computed if the probability distributions for the stress and strength are known. The factors which determine the parameters of the distributions for stress and strength random variables can be controlled in design problems. This leads to the problem of finding the optimal values of these parameters subject to resource and design constraints. Some optimization models are discussed. The special structure of these models is exploited to develop the optimization techniques which are illustrated by simple design examples."
 "A repairable 2-unit warm-standby system with repair and preventive maintenance is discussed. Two models are presented. In each of the models the mean time to system failure and the steady state availability are calculated. Some numerical calculations illustrate the results."
"We discuss two models of 2-unit standby redundant systems with imperfect switchover. In Model I the switch assumes up and down states repeatedly, independently of the behavior of the main unit. We obtain the stochastic behavior of the system, i.e., the first-passage time distributions, the expected numbers of visits to a certain state, and the transition probabilities. In Model II the failure of the switch can be detected only when it is used."
 "Two models have been considered for a complex system with two classes of components L1 and L2. L1 components are connected in series; failure of an L1 component causes failure of the system. Class L2 consists of large number of components. Failure of any one L2 component reduces the efficiency of the system. Repairs of L2 components are followed by post-repairs. In Model I, repairs and post-repairs are done by a single channel; in Model II, there are separate channels for the two. Failure and repair times are exponentially distributed. Laplace transforms of the various probability states are obtained."
"This paper develops a method of selecting a decision threshold when the uncertainties in the levels of the signal to be measured and the threshold detector are Gaussian. The false alarm probability and undetected fault probability are established as a function of mean threshold level and the parameters of the uncertainties. These two errors are combined, and this combination is plotted for various weightings of the two types of errors. In general, optimum threshold settings exist. The use of multiple thresholds for reducing the probability of making the wrong decision is also discussed."
"Life distribution properties of a device subject to wear occurring randomly in time as a gamma process are related to the corresponding properties of the probability of surviving a specified amount of wear."
"Bum-in and replacement policies have been used to reduce the cost of maintaining a system function. Existing solutions to the burn-in and the combined burn-in, replacement problems are typically difficult to apply. A simpler solution to this problem is given. The only distributional property required is the reliability function. Thus either parametric or nonparametric estimates of reliability can be used in the solution. The nonparametric solution is appealing in the case of a combined burn-in and replacement policy because the U shaped failure rate makes parametric estimation of reliability difficult."
"We present the asymptotically best linear unbiased estimator for the scale parameter of the Rayleigh distribution based on samples where there may be type 2 censoring in the tails. The coefficients of the estimator are expressible in simple closed forms. All that is needed is knowledge of the amount of censoring. The estimator has good efficiency even for samples as small as 5."

   "Qualification testing programs have been developed for assessing the reliability of commercial grade discrete semiconductors for use in office business machines. These programs include accelerated stresses of high temperature storage (HTS) and high temperature reverse bias (HTRB) for 1000 hours, and a sequence test of thermal cycle and thermal shock followed by storage at 85°C and 85% RH (85/85) for 1000 hours. Both hermetic and plastic encapsulated parts have been tested more than 15 million part hours. HTRB and 85/85 are about twice as effective as HTS in identifying potentially unreliable parts. Plastic packaged semiconductors are inherently capable of withstanding 85/85 for 1000 hours without parameter degradation. The value of qualification testing against the 85/85 environment is demonstrated by the observed correlation of machine failure rates in the field with the relative humidity in the use environment. The observed failure rate of plastic parts is not more than 3.2 times that of hermetic parts. Plastic parts are capable of reliable operation, but the marked differences in reliability between different vendors and between different part types from the same vendor require increased process and materials control in order to achieve the potential of which plastic parts are capable."
 "This paper describes some of the advantages, shortcomings, and recommended changes to MIL-STD-781B, which is a military specification for reliability test plans. Particular emphasis is given to laboratory discrepancies that are excluded from consideration as relevant failures. The principal reason that MIL-STD-781B test results do not reasonably foretell the minimum MTBF that can be expected in the field is that the field definition of failure is not compatible with the laboratory definition."
 "A simple method is given for calculating a) reliability characteristics of repairable and nonrepairable systems, and b) the importance of the individual system components. Assumptions made include independent component failures and constant failure and repair rates for the components. The methods can easily be implemented in a computer program that would be inexpensive to execute and would always overpredict (usually very slightly) the system failure characteristics."
"The paper is concerned with the analysis of fault trees and describes an algorithm for deriving a reduced Boolean sum-of-product (s-o-p) expression from a description of the structure. The algorithm was developed initially as an analytic procedure for combinational logic networks and employs a reverse Polish notation to describe the structure which is then converted to an equivalent s-o-p expression. This procedure is equally applicable to fault tree analysis but care must be exercised in interpreting the Boolean result as a probability relationship. This aspect is discussed and a simple test and modification procedure described, enabling the original Boolean s-o-p expression to be converted into an equivalent s-o-p expression which can be interpreted directly as a probability relationship."
 "Two problems are considered: 1) testing the hypothesis that the shape parameters of k 2-parameter Weibull populations are equal, given a sample of n observations censored (Type II) at r failures, from each population; and 2) Under the assumption of equal shape parameters, the problem of testing the equality of the p-th percentiles. Test statistics (for these hypotheses), which are simple functions of the maximum likelihood estimates, follow distributions that depend only upon r,n,k,p and not upon the Weibull parameters. Critical values of the test statistics found by Monte Carlo sampling are given for selected values of r,n,k,p. An expression is found and evaluated numerically for the exact distribution of the ratio of the largest to smallest maximum likelihood estimates of the Weibull shape parameter in k samples of size n, Type II censored at r = 2. The asymptotic behavior of this distribution for large n is also found."
 "Reliability for probabilistic design and the simple stress-strength failure model depend only upon the interference of the stress and the strength random variables. This paper presents a methodology to compute bounds on the design reliability, given some bounds on probabilities over intervals of the overlapping tails of the stress and the strength random variables. Quadratic programming optimization is employed to find upper and lower bounds on reliability."
 "This paper proves a necessary and sufficient realizability condition of the s-expected terminal capacity matrix of a probabilistic communication net. The proof is based on the successive reduction processes of a matrix, which provide a technique for designing a tree topology and determing edge capacities and reliabilities that satisfy the matrix."
 "This paper compares numerically two different, widely used lower limit estimates for the reliability of a series system: Bayesian limits and fiducial limits. The fiducial limits are obtained by Monte Carlo simulation because of its simplicity and ease of computer programming. Subsystem failures are s-independent and exponentially distributed; life test data are available for estimating the failure rate of each system."
"A System has associated with it a Safeguard such that whenever a failure in the Safeguard is detected, the System is shut down. The System is restarted as soon as the Safeguard is repaired. An example is a standby protective system attached to a nuclear power plant; as soon as failure is detected in the protective system the nuclear plant will be shut down until repair is completed. In order to insure that the Safeguard remains in the utmost state of readiness, the components of the Safeguard are periodically tested, and repaired if the test reveals a failure. In this paper we define a measure of readiness appropriate for the above systems and consider the problem of determining the testing frequency of the components of the Safeguard in such a way that an adequate level of readiness is maintained. As an illustration, the method is applied to a typical reactor-trip system."
 "Mathematical models for reliability of a redundant system with two classes of failure modes are usually formulated as a nonlinear integer programming (NIP) problem. This paper reformulates the NIP problem into a 0-1 linear programming (ZOLP) problem and a one-to-one correspondence is shown between this NIP problem and the ZOLP problem. A NIP example treated by Tillman is formulated into a ZOLP problem and optimal solutions, identical to Tillman's are obtained by an implicit enumeration method. Calculating the new coefficients of the objective function and the constraints in the ZOLP are straight forward. There are not many constraints or variables in the proposed ZOLP. Consequently, the computation (CPU) time is less."
 "The cost of reliability acceptance testing can be more easily reduced by optimizing the parameters of the test rather than by relaxing the precision of the test. The test parameters are sample size, test configuration, and the duration of the test; the environmental stresses that are inherent in reliability testing are fixed. Optimization can be achieved when the various costs associated with the test are known, and limited resources of funds, time, and space constrain the tests."
 "An age replacement policy is considered for pairs of units which operate in parallel and which have lifetimes displaying a bivariate exponential distribution. Both units are to be replaced at the same time. The limiting expected cost per unit time is the optimization criterion. The results state that no replacements should be made until at least one of the units in the pair fails. Both units shoould then be replaced either when one fails or when both fail, depending on which procedure involves the smaller limiting expected cost per unit time."
 "The availability of a repairable system having one operating unit supported by n standby units is analyzed. The units have an exponential failure time distribution and the failed units are repaired, one at a time, with a general repair time distribution. An asymptotic formula of the stationary availability is derived, and is shown to give exact results for exponential repair times. Numerical examples show that the asymptotic formula gives a good approximation even for small n."
"This paper deals with the availability and the reliability analysis of a 1-server 2-unit system with imperfect switch. Explicit expressions for the Laplace transform of the mean down-time of the system and for the mean time to system failure have been obtained."
"The paper analyses the availability and reliability of a 1-server parallel-unit cold-standby system; each unit consists of several series components. The failure rate of a component is constant; its repair time distribution is arbitrary. Explicit expressions for the Laplace transform of the mean down-time of the system and for the mean time to system failure have been obtained by locating suitable regenerative stochastic phenomena."
 "A mathematical model is established for reliability estimation in a modularly redundant system whose coverage depends on the tasks which the system is performing. The system consists of active units plus one spare on warm standby. The mean time-to-system-failure and the Laplace transformn of reliability are obtained. An explicit formula for the reliability is obtained when the ``time for performing a task'' is a constant. The approximate formulas are very simple and easy to use."

   "A computerized analysis is outlined; it uses a lognormal distribution that is fitted to the observed data by the maximum likelihood method. A typical computer output illustrates the failure levels at operational temperatures. The statistical curve fitting technique aids the analysis of accelerated lifetest data. Failure estimates at junction temperatures, much lower than those under accelerated lifetest, are obtained by extrapolation. However, it is up to user whether such an extrapolation is justified. Due to the quantized nature of the data, an optimum exists for the time of device inspection, whereby statistical information is obtained at minimum testing expense. For example, inspecting the 250°C sample at 80 and 160 hours would be a waste of time since no failures should occur."
 "An accelerated test of a product under high stress yields life data that are extrapolated to estimate the life distribution at low stress. When the data contain competing failure modes, the dominant modes under high stress may not dominate under low stress. This has made experimenters doubt the validity of tests yielding such data. This expository paper presents new graphical methods for estimating: 1) a separate relationship between life and stress for each failure mode, 2) the life distribution at low stress when all modes act, and 3) the life distribution that would result if certain modes are eliminated. Data from a temperature-accelerated life test of electrical insulation illustrate the methods."
 "The general validity and effectiveness of accelerated tests of microcircuits using both temperature and voltage as accelerating stresses has been demonstrated. However, the inherent effectiveness of the accelerated tests can only be assured through careful selection of the life-test circuit-configuration, and test temperatures, and the effective analysis of the resulting failure data. Careful selection of the accelerating electrical and thermal stresses is essential for maximum acceleration of use-condition failure-mechanisms without introducing damaging or unrealistic failure modes. Effective mathematical analysis of the test data is necessary to ensure an accurate determination of use-condition failure-rates. A discussion of the techniques utilized to conduct microcircuit accelerated life testing and a detailed description of a recent microcircuit accelerated test study program conducted under contract to the Rome Air Development Center are presented."
"A series of failures of large arc-furnace transformers have caused users and manufacturers to reevaluate their traditional view of transformer reliability. The costs of outages are higher because arcfurnaces now produce a larger fraction of all steel in the Western world than in the past. The purpose of this paper is to present a model for minimizing the costs of failure including down time, caused by a sudden breakdown of a large piece of equipment, which could be replaced with another unit performing identical function and called ``sliding standby.'' Models include replacement of the failed unit with a i) standby, ii) leasing, and iii) repair program; the time value of money; costs associated with failure; taxes; variables suggested by Jorgenson and Radner; variables suggested by steel industry experts. Since the useful life of an arc- furnace transformer is rarely known in advance with a degree of certainty, the reliability is analyzed. An empirical distribution of failure times is based on a sample taken from experts in the steel industry."
"This paper describes the results of tests of the stability and reliability of complementary MOS (CMOS) integrated circuits (IC). Operating life-tests at 125°C indicated excellent stability of electrical characteristics of both n-channel and p-channel transistors. Over three million device-hours of accelerated operating life-tests indicated a calculated failure rate, at a 60-percent s-confidence level, of 0.08%/1000 hours at 125°C, which corresponds to 0.01%/1000 hours at 55°C or 0.003%/1000 hours at 25°C. Field-usage reliability data on three satellites in orbit indicate a total failure rate of 0.003%/1000 hours (over thirty-four million operating hours with no failures). The observed failure rates are compared with other available data on IC reliability, and it is concluded that the reliability of CMOS ICs is equal to that of p-channel MOS circuits or of bipolar digital circuits of equal complexity, when each type is prepared by a well-controlled process, and operated at the same temperature. The operating temperature of CMOS IC chips in electronic systems is, however, generally lower since logic functions are accomplished at lower dissipation per gate."
 "The basic voting technique, which estimates the posterior fault-probability from prior fault-probability plus test data, is developed from first principles and given a pattern-recognition interpretation. This leads to the philosophy that the technique is one of a family suitable for fault diagnosis, if necessary down to component level, using only input-output frequency-domain test-data. A simulation of 39 200 faulty 7-component passive circuits is described, which shows that the two voting techniques considered in detail are superior to previously reported template-matching methods of fault diagnosis by factors of 5:1 or more in situations where nonfaulty components are permitted to have standard deviations of 3% nominal value, which is not untypical of much current practice. The circuit model is similar to modules making up larger systems of several hundred components. Because voting techniques require relatively little storage of data they are well suited to quality control schemes based on automatic test equipment. In comparison, data storage for template-matching methods are often prohibitive. Best use of voting techniques is possible when clearly defined fault cases are established which should ideally be considered at the system design stage."
"It is known that a perfectly maintained complex system of identical components, will, after an initial transient period, behave like a Poisson renewal process. In the present paper we present the results of a specific simulation which was carried out to find out how long the transient period lasts."
 "If n items are on life test where n is unknown, and failures are observed either until time T has elapsed or until r failures have occurred, then an estimate of n can be obtained. Both maximum likelihood and Bayes estimates are obtained and both known and unknown failure distributions are considered."
"This paper presents the stochastic behaviour of a 2-dissimilar--unit cold-standby redundant system with repair and preventive maintenance. The Laplace-Stieltjes transform of (i) The first-passage time distribution to system failure, (ii) The expected number of system failures during (0, t], (iii) The probability that the system fails at time t, are all derived by using unique modifications of a Markov renewal process. Three examples are given."
"This paper introduces the Delay Times (preparing/waiting time for repair). The Laplace-Stieltjes transform of 1) The first-passage time distribution to system failure, 2) The s-expected number of system failures during (0, t], 3) The probability that the system fails at time t, are all derived for a 2-unit warm-standby redundant system by unique modification of a Markov Renewal process. Three examples are given"
"Two models are given for a complex system; they depend on the demand of the system. In Model I, the system is stopped when there is no demand; in Model II, the system is always operable irrespective of the demand. Laplace transforms of the probabilities of the system states are obtained."
"The availability is analysed for a supervised system which has very short and arbitrarily distributed supervisory periods (supervision is a continuous monitoring to detect failures). The Markov model is continuous in time and alternates between two and three discrete states; it leads to an expression which can be used in an iterative calculation of availability. Optimisation of availability is used to illustrate the approach."
 "An algorithm is described for solving the reliability model of a repairable system of n identical components placed in a fluctuating 2-state environment. An important application is where the effects of alternating normal and severe weather conditions are to be evaluated. A modified version of the algorithm can accommodate the case where faults are followed by switching operations, as in power transmission networks. Whereas the standard Markov method to solve such models is cumbersome and other available methods are often limited in scope, the proposed algorithm is fast, reasonably accurate, and does not require a computer."
 "This paper derives a) the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the time-to-system-failure distribution, and b) the mean time-to-system-failure. The system consists of several elements with one repair facility which remains idle until a queue of failed units is built up."

   "A good reliability program through design and production results in excellent equipment performance in the field. A full life cycle under controlled failure reporting and analysis procedures is covered. An excess of 48 000 flight hours over 27 000 missions with 303 failures reported from five reporting maintenance shops constitutes the field reporting phase. In addition, details and supporting documentation of the overall reliability program during the Design Phase, Demonstration Phase, Production Phase and Field Use Phase are presented."
 "A cause-consequence chart is applied in analysing failures of a redundant protection system (a core spray system in a nuclear power plant). It is shown how the diagram provides a basis for calculating two probability measures for malfunctioning of the protection system. The test policy of components is taken into account. The possibility of using parameter variation as a basis for the choice of test policy is indicated."
 "This paper presents a useful procedure of solving nonlinear integer programming problems. It finds, first, a pseudo-solution to the problem, as if the variables were continuous. Then it uses direct search in the neighbourhood of the pseudo-solution to find the optimum. The effectiveness of the method is shown with a 15-variable problem, which requires about 1 day's FORTRAN programming effort and 8 seconds of computer time for its solution on an IBM 370/165 digital computer."
"Suppose an experimenter wishes to select the better of two Weibull populations. In a life testing situation he may have some time t* for which the device must perform properly and he would consider the better population to be the one with the larger reliability at time t*. It is reasonable for the experimenter to test n items from each of the two populations until there are r(r < n) failures from each and then select as better the population for which the maximum likelihood estimate of the reliability at time t* is the larger. This paper presents the sample sizes needed to achieve a desired level for the probability of correct selection with such a decision rule."
 "The following bounds are derived for the Weibull failure model when the parameter is being characterized by the inverted gamma and uniform probability density functions (pdf); they are lower and upper Bayes-confidence bounds for the scale parameter and lower bounds for the reliability function. To illustrate the results a Monte Carlo simulation was performed to obtain 90% and 95% Bayes-confidence bounds for the scale parameter and lower limits for the corresponding reliability function of the Weibull failure distribution. The consequences that one encounters when the following ``wrong'' priors have been chosen to characterize the random behavior of the scale parameter are investigated. The results are compared when the prior pdf of θ is uniform but inverted gamma was used, and vice versa."
  "The Empirical Bayes approach in reliability is reviewed non-technically by discussing the questions: What is Empirical Bayes; how does it differ from Bayes; when can I use it; how do I use it; and what do I gain by using it? The Empirical Bayes method is applied to the problem of estimating the outage rates for two 115 kV transmission circuits of a regional power company."
 "This paper develops a mathematical theory associated with frequency and duration methods in system reliability evaluation. The approach is based upon the concept of frequency as an expectation of the state encounter rate. These concepts are then used to derive the basic conditions for mergeability which are very useful when evaluating the reliability of large systems."
 "Reliability analyses of multi-component systems can often be refined by combining Markov-chain models for detailed component characterizations with fault-tree evaluation techniques for describing over-all system behavior. A difficulty encountered in the application of this combined approach is that component maintenance policies can induce statistical dependence among component failures. Thereby, straightforward evaluation of overall system characteristics based upon the assumption of statistically independent component failures can lead to erroneous conclusions. This paper examines the effect of dependent component failures, as induced by the component maintenance policies, on system performance; and it demonstrates that for certain types of maintenance policies (when component maintenance is independent of the condition of the other system components), meaningful results can be obtained by assuming the independence of component failures. The feasibility of the proposed approach is illustrated through a maintenance scheduling problem in nuclear engineering practice."
 "An efficient algorithm is presented for computing the reliability matrix of a logic network whose components are characterized by a known probability of malfunctioning. Using the concept of path sensitizing, a graphical representation of error propagation is derived. Through the computation of Boolean path functions, the information provided by these graphs is put into a malfunction table from which the matrix entries are directly computed. The method not only offers computational efficiency but also provides further physical insight into the reliability problem."
 "An n-Cascade system is defined as a special type of standby system with n components. A component fails if the stress on it is not less than its strength. When a component in cascade fails, the next in standby is activated and will take on the stress. However, the stress on this component will be a multiple k times the stress that acted on its predecessor. The system fails if due to an initial stress, each of the components in succession fails. The stress is random and the component strengths are independent and identically distributed variates, with specified probability functions; k is constant. Expressions for system reliability are obtained when the stress and strength distributions are exponential. Reliability values for a 2-cascade system with Gamma and Normal stress and strength distributions are computed, some of which are presented graphically."
 "The renewal and interval-reliability functions for repairable components are solved for given general probability distribution of renewal interarrival times. Two powerful numerical methods are 1) A finite difference approach wherein the renewal equation is written in discrete form and then the resulting system of algebraic equations is solved recursively. 2) Transforms of the renewal equation are treated and Fourier series expansions are used. The Fourier series approach has a wider range of applicability than finite difference in that it can be used to solve the complete renewal problem. A new equivalent form of the interval-reliability integral equation leads to a computationally faster scheme (by a factor of 10) and a simplified approximate solution for high reliability components. A numerical solution for confidence intervals has also been generated for the average interval-reliability of a component within a system, given component failure data, using a pseudo-Bayesian approach. The goal is to choose priors that lead to classical limits and not the usual Bayesian limits. The intervals yield close-to-exact frequency limits depending on sample size, Weibull shape parameter and the true reliability."
"A mathematical model is established for the availability of a modularly redundant repairable system which consists of many active units and one standby; coverage is considered. The hazard rates for an active unit and for the standby unit are different and are assumed to be constant. Repair time distributions are general. Availability for the system, mean system up-time, and mean system down-time are derived."
"Randomization to improve confidence bounds for parameters of discrete distributions is discussed and compared with ``classical'' non-randomized bounds. An example demonstrates the use of this method in a typical reliability application. This ``well known'' procedure should be useful to reliability engineers."
"The concept of availability includes reliability as well as preventive and corrective maintenance. An availability model which includes both aspects of this problem is proposed in this paper. The model includes the following decision variables: 1. failure rates and repair rates of individual units 2. the time period for perfect-preventive maintenance for a given mission time 3. the optimal failure and repair rates as a function of design costs, corrective and preventive maintenance costs. The objective is to minimize the design and operating costs where the availability requirements are satisfied. An example is solved for a system with n subsystems in series where two units in parallel comprise each subsystem. The general approach is applicable to solving other complex availability problems."
 "The reliability of a system can be found analytically, given the time-to-failure distribution for each element and the system configuration. Such analysis becomes increasingly difficult as the complexity of a system increases. This paper presents a Monte Carlo simulation procedure to estimate the reliability of a complex system with relative ease. A computer program, written in FORTRAN IV G Level code for an IBM 360/65 computer, finds all minimal tie-sets from the system configuration, which is provided as a coded reliability flow graph. Each replication in the simulation involves a search through the minimal tie-sets to identify the success or failure of the system for each value of the required time of satisfactory performance. The reliability of the system is then estimated as a tabulated function of time."
 "A short proof, based on properties of the mean residual lifetime function, is given for a general theorem on characterization by conditional expectations."
"This paper presents a truncated sequential procedure for testing if the failure rate of a device is constant versus a linearly increasing failure rate. A number of items, N, are placed on test and their failure times are recorded sequentially. After each observation one decides either to accept or reject a constant failure rate or to wait for another observation. Simulation under various parametric conditions yields information on the initial choice of N, average sample sizes, and points on the OC curve. Selection of the various parametric conditions is discussed. An example illustrates the use of the test."
"This paper is concerned with the reliability optimization of a spatially redundant system, subject to various constraints, by using nonlinear programming. The constrained optimization problem is converted into a sequence of unconstrained optimization problems by using a penalty function. The new problem is then solved by the conjugate gradient method. The advantages of this method are highlighted."
 "An algorithm is developed to obtain a simplified reliability expression for a general network. All the success paths of the network are determined; then they are modified to be mutually disjoint. The reliability expression follows directly from the disjoint paths. The algorithm is easy and computationally economical. The reliability expression involves fewer terms and arithmetic operations than any of the existing methods. This is an advantage, considering the size of the system a reliability engineer normally handles and the frequency with which the expression is used for reliability studies."
"An algorithm for the heuristic solution of redundancy optimization problems is presented. There may be any number of constraints which need not be linear. For selecting the stage where redundancy is to be added, a heuristic criterion is introduced which takes into account the relative increment in reliability versus decrement in slacks. The algorithm is simple and requires minimum computation."
"An alternating renewal process is considered which has four random variables; the process terminates when a specified event happens. It is shown with several examples that the results are of great use in reliability theory."
"The cumulative damage model of Takács is considered wherein damage is incurred by shocks and then decreases exponentially with time. The distribution of the total amount of damage and its mean, and the limiting distribution of the total amount of damage have been derived. This tutorial note gives 2 examples."
"This note discusses more explicitly an age replacement policy suggested by Barlow and Proschan and gives a few useful results. It shows that several different problems can be reduced to the typical age replacement problem, and gives numerical examples."

"We have described the objectives and architecture of an experimental system component, the inventory control system, which provides controlled access to system resources and data with decentralized authorization responsibility. In addition, the inventory control system is a prerequisite for an automatic dataset migration and staging facility. The control system provides a mechanism for the collecting of dataset usage statistics not other wise provided in OS MVT or OS/VS2 and is a supplement of the catalog function. The system has been implemented and meets the implementation objectives that have been described in this paper. The system has proved to be reliaibnl e very measureable respect. Security is not an absolute attribute; our objective was to obtain a significant improvement in protection within the costs acceptable to a commercial data processing installation. The described mechanism provides a considerable obstacle against a marginal informed violator. Protection against the informed and determined opponent will require deep-reaching changes in systems design as well. We believe, however, that many of the concepts tested with the inventory control system will be necessary in future #x201C;secure” systems."
"Audit trail requirements were discussed as they apply to data bases. In summary, the major conclusions reached in this paper follow."
"Contemporary operating systems provide system resource management mechanisms that permit the installation manager to define his system performance objectives. The installation manager thinks of these objectives in terms of response time or throughput, but in relaity they have to be translated into system internal terms such as time slice deadlines or service units. This is not an easy translation to make, since it requires experimentation with different system resource management policies. Identifying the appropriate system resouce management policy require methodological approach. Such a methodology consists, first, of performance measurements, workload characterization, and performance evaluation, followed by a series of performance tuning experiments. We found that by using such a methodology, we were able to characterize the workload and the behavior of the IBM Research Division's TSS/360 system, then verify that our proposed scheduling change positively improved system responsiveness."
"The Power Profile is a amrked improvement over the previous method for estimating system electrical power parameters. The use of APL together with telephone networks and terminals has made the program available to a large number of users at various locations with IBM."
"In this paper, a genera model for the optimal allocation of priorities through pricing is considered. The case of two priority queues ids discussed in detail. (for the m-priority queue analysis, the reader may refer to Reference 11.) In both cases, it is shown that a set of admission tolls can be established at the different priority queues. These tolls are based on user urgency, the job arrival rate, the expected service time, and the number of priority classes. By setting a different admission toll at each priority queue and by providing the user with information and motivation, he is encouraged to weigh the relative vlaues of the services before picking the priority for his job. According to his urgency, the user minimizes hsi total average cost function (cost to joint a certain priority plus the cost of delay). Pricing is addressed to the allocation of priorities in a computing system to minimize the total average cost of delay of an installation's user community. Each user is free to decide on the priority assigned to his job, and the optimality of the system is maintained. As a result, the computer can process first those jobs that are urgent and then proceed with less urgent jobs. The uncertainty of the cost per unit time delay c is considered in this model. It has been found, for the case of two priority queues, that if you have an estimate of the mean of the probability density function of the cost of delay per unit time ƒ(c), the cost differential (x1 - x2) is insensitive to the exact distribution. This result is feasible if we can redistribute the demand such that ρ ≤ 0.75. During periods with high traffic intensity it is shown that the admission tolls at the higher priority queues should be increased."
"Given the methodology and tools, the major barrier to carrying out productivity studies of the kind discussed in this paper is our ignorance of certain system and usage characteristics. Clearly, the first order of business is to develop measurement techniques so as to provide the required data. A review of this paper makes it evident that the kinds of data needed are the following: • System congestion characteritics, as illustrated in Figure 2. • Usage characteristics, ts, Tr, Tu, To, Nu, as illustrtaed in Figures 1 and 4. • Project cost-delay-precedence characteristics, as shown in Figure 14. • Interface investment-payoff characteristics, as shown by Figure 17."
   "The theme of our previous issue, installation management techniques, is continued in this issue in the first three papers described below."
"Administering the allocation of a computer resource can be segmented into several responsibilities, with fairly well defined subjects of common concern: the policy of the parent organization and strategies to realize the overall objectives by allocating computer resources and assessing results; tactics of users to maximize value per unit price; control functions to demonstrate compliance with externally imposed regulations; planning and assessment within the computer facility; and technology of load measurement. It is possible to design an installation accounting package that does much to decouple these varied functions. We have described an implementation that is quite successful in this regard."
"The results indicate that the 2 – 7 system condition gives a statistically poorer system reaction time than the other system conditions. However, the amounto f performance degradation was not deemed serious by management."
"With a thorough understanding of the various types of testing, of the objectives or purposes of specific tests, and of the test tools and test methodology, it is feasible to conduct meaningful tests in a complex systems environment. The major test tools are the test driver itself, the test libraries, the ability to edit or modify tests, and the post-test analysis programs. By utilizing these testools and the methodology shown, both functional and performance tests can be conducted. The combination of tools and methods can accelerate program development, aid migration, ensure that accuracy and performancge oals are met, and reduce costs by the replacement of manual methods with the automated testing techniques described."
"In this paper, we have dealt with some aspects of system performance, but we have left many questions unanswered. The analyses we have described will tell us, hopefully, whether the system is saturated and which components are at fault, but further analysis will be required to determine exactly how much additional capacity is needed to achieve a desired performance level."
"The concepts and techniques of virtual storage programming and those of structured programming have grown along diverse j paths. Virtual storage programming has evolved largely by looking retrospectively at programs designed and coded by means other than structured programming, and thus has included techniques that are not applicable to structured programming. Structured programming has evolved with little regard to virtual storage, and thus includes techniques alien to virtual storage systems."
   "The Retail Store and Supermarket Systems are designed to assist in performing the tasks of store operations, in particular, sales, ordering, and ticket-making. They are also designed to solve the problems and perform the tasks of the area headquarters management with the user's programs using data collected from store operation for inventory control, labor scheduling, traffic management, store shelf allocation, sales promotion assessment, and item profitability evaluation, among others."
"Optical scanning components of supermarket systems require machine-readable code. The need for industry-wide cooperation and standardization of a code and symbol was shown. The sources of decoding error in printed optical codes were discussed and a class of codes, the (n, k ) codes, relatively resistant to error, were presented. The UPC code is a (7, 2) code. The UPC code and a method of decoding it were described. Decodability depends on several parameters; their quantitative relationships and effects upon decodability are found in another paper."
"The operator's general role in the total Retail Store and Supermarket Systems was discussed briefly and his specific role in the input of data was discussed in some detail. Some of the major differences between the data input requirements of a system for a supermarket and for a retail store included the volume of data and the rate of entry required. These items were discussed in terms of the system requirements and alternative methods of implementation. The alternatives selected were wand entry for the Retail Store System and fixed optical scanning for the Supermarket System. These techniques required the investigation of some basic human performance parameters. Examples of some of these studies were presented and discussed to illustrate a portion of the testing activities that were performed to define and measure the operator's role and interaction with some system components."
"The functional objective of the Supermarket System is to provide complete shopper checkout and store support facilities and to capture vital operational data at the point-of-sale. The system consists of a store controller and point-of-sale terminals that communicate with the controller through two store loops (maximum of 12 terminals per loop). The controller is capable of batch communication with a System/370 host computer on a switched line. The controller can also provide back-up foar companion (remote) store whose controller has failed. Communication with the terminals in the remote store is through the store loops in the remote store and a switched line (for a detailed description of the system, see the paper by McEnroe, Huth, Moore, and Morris; and of the scanner, see Dickson and Soderstrom)."
"The ability to make performance projections for the retail system requires a detailed knowledge of the range of retail functions that are executed within the system and a detailed knowledge of the internal design of the system. It is essential that the performance of the system be evaluated over a range of environmental assumptions anticipated in the annual operating cycle of the store."
"Adequate system availability is provided by suitable redundancy of components. The general form of redundancy chosen is a composite form in which the reserve component is operating on its own behalf while ready to take over the tasks of a failed component. In particular, the point-of-sale terminal can pick up the operation of another terminal if failure occurs in midtransaction, and the supermarket controller can assume the load of a failed controller in another store. The retail point-of-sale terminals can operate off-line in the event of controller or loop failure. Each supermarket is served by two loops so that half the number of termipals in the store will be unaffected by a loop failure."
  "We believe that the data processing needs of a major medical center do not differ fundamentally from those of government or industry. Experience in our environment is that data processing is playing an increasingly prominent role in the full spectrum of services. Not only is the number of applications increasing, but they are also becoming more diverse and imaginative as users become more directly involved in the process."
"The data collection, display, and analysis tools and techniques found desirable to support the smooth running of a VM/370 installation appear to be diverse, yet their use must be weel coordinated. In a summary, a user's productivity may be enhanced by linking the nature of his terminal activity to the performance of the system by making available to him measures of utilization and contention for major resources. Operators and system analysts may monitor the performance of the system in real time and attempt to diagnose and correct undesirable load situations. Full analysis of severe or complex performance problems may be conducted off-line when necessary and special user measurement requirements may be satisfied. Basic trends in resource utilization and system performance are available to management in summary form. Although these facilities have been developed and put to use subsequent to initial installation of the system, they appear to provide the kind of services that should be an integral part of control program functions, since they help users, maintenance programmers and installation management to strive toward making optimal use of their computing system."
"The practical examples of the use of queuing models in computer system design and analysis have introduced basic principles and applications of queuing theory. These principles may serve as a useful introduction or review. The cited references and general references may be used to build upon this foundation by their presentations of more complex models, such as those that analyze machine interference and multiserver queues."
"In this paper, we have shown how a hierarchically structured operating system can provide substantially better software reliability and security than a conventional two-level multiprogramming operating system approach. A virtual machine facility, such as VM/370, makes it possible to convert a two-level conventional operating system into a three-level hierarchically structured operating system. Furthermore, by using redundant security mechanisms, a high degree of security is attainable."
   "When an electric field is present across two different fluid dielectrics having a common plane boundary, some disturbances in the interfacial boundary are found to grow in time. The liquid ink development process is viewed as the result of varying instability of the oil-ink interface as a function of the differing field gradient in light and dark areas of the exposed image. In an analysis of the disturbances into normal modes, the theory relates the effects upon instability due to potential difference across the oil, the surface tension, the respective viscosities of the oil and the ink, and the finite thicknesses of the oil, ink, and the photoconductor layer. The threshold potential difference for the onset of instability is also given."
"Multiconic surfaces are a generalization of the type of surface called polyconic in numerical control of machine tools. The general theory is developed in this paper using a new parametrization. In the original form there was a problem as to whether or not a point that satisfies surface equations actually belonged to the intended surface. This difficulty is removed by the new technique."
"Threshold voltage characteristics are presented for a double boron-ion-implanted n-channel enhancement MOSFET device for high speed logic circuit applications. A 15-Ω-cm high resistivity p-type (100) substrate was used to achieve low junction capacitance and low threshold substrate sensitivity. A shallow boron implant was used to raise the threshold voltage, and a second, deeper, boron implant was used to increase the punch-through voltage between the source and the drain. This design is especially beneficial for short channel devices, while maintaining the low junction capacitance and low threshold substrate sensitivity of the high resistivity substrate. A one-dimensional analysis was performed to predict the effects of ion implantation dose and energy on the device characteristics, and a quasi two-dimensional analysis was used to account for the short channel effect. The calculated results agree well with the behavior of experimental devices fabricated in the laboratory."
"Computations of the daily and annual totals of the solar energy incident upon south-facing tilted flat surfaces were carried out for several cloudfree atmospheric models after taking into account, somewhat arbitrarily, the contribution due to sky radiation and that due to radiation reflected by the ground. Representative variations of these quantities are discussed as a function of several parameters such as geographical latitude of the location, tilt angle of the surface, atmospheric transmission characteristics, sky-radiation contribution, and ground reflectivity."
"A particularly simple Markov chain model for a reference string is described. The model, which is only slightly more complicated than the independent reference model, generates strings that have a locality property and that have a specified probability distribution of references over pages. Expressions are obtained for expected working-set size and expected working-set miss ratio. The model is used in an examination of the effect of grouping pages into blocks and in a discussion of the problem of evaluating the effect of changes in the size of the data base. Predictions of the model are shown to agree closely with observations of a string of data base references generated by an interactive data base system having a large number of concurrent users."
"HEME, a computer program for diagnosis-oriented analysis of hematologic diseases, accepts as input information about a patient and provides as output an ordered list of suggested diagnoses, an analysis of the logic behind these diagnoses, and a list of tests relevant to these diagnoses and not yet performed. The decision algorithm is based on Bayes’ Theorem. Each disease in the system is individually analyzed, and the probability that the patient has the disease vs the probability that he does not is calculated. Bayesian methods of statistical inference are utilized in that the prior probabilities of the diseases and the probabilities of findings in given diseases were initially estimated from the judgment of experienced hematologists with the intention that they be modified automatically as data are accumulated. This program is intended for use in teaching hematology, as an aid to diagnosis, and as a means for studying the diagnostic process."
"Programming techniques are presented for computing dc sensitivity vectors of nonlinear electronic circuits. The modified nodal approach is used as the method of formulation for the circuit equations, in which multiple performance objectives can be accommodated. Numerical examples illustrate some of the techniques discussed."
"A mathematical formalism is described through which a program is given a symbolic representation and, with the application of several basic formulas, may be transformed into an equivalent representation giving rise to a reorganized program. Examples are given in which programs are simplified (e.g., code is reduced) or reorganized into a structured form. In effect a mathematics is described that applies to programs in much the same manner as Boolean algebra applies to switching circuits."
"Several earlier papers have applied some identities relating the Laplace and Mellin transforms; this note develops certain such identities, achieving greater generality and rigor. Specifically each of these transforms is expressed as a contour integral involving the other, and an expansion of the Laplace transform is derived in terms of the functions (s·d/ds)n(1+s)−1 with coefficients defined by the Mellin transform."
"Amorphous GdCoCr films of various composition ratios made by rf bias sputtering are investigated for their applicability as bubble domain supporting materials. Film compositions around Gd0.13Co0.65Cr0.22 have temperature-insensitive magnetizations between 240 K and 350 K with Tcomp nearly 120 K and Tc nearly 630 K. Reduction of the Cr content from 21.8 to 20.3 at. percent causes an increase of the magnetization by a factor of three. Thermal cycling of these films between 290 K and 570 K does not change the magnetization noticeably, nor does annealing for up to six days at 520 K. The films are found to be very susceptible to contamination by the residual oxygen present in the vacuum chamber during sputtering. Films contaminated with 3 to 13 at. percent oxygen have coercivities around 800 A/m (10 Oe), whereas films which were oxygen-free according to microprobe investigations show coercivities less than 80 A/m (1 Oe)."
"Experimental results for frequency response and halfpulse width of digital recording signals have been obtained for submicrometer transducer spacings, for the case of a flexible disk flying in close proximity to a rigidly mounted conventional ferrite recording head. Using optical flying heights rather than an “effective spacing,” together with a modification of the Williams-Comstock write-process slope criterion, we have obtained excellent agreement between experimental results and theoretical predictions. This suggests that the notion of effective spacing can be avoided."

   "An apparatus is described which permits for the first time the resolution of anelastic relaxation effects in evaporated metallic thin films and ion-implanted surface layers of silicon. The composite samples consist of the film or layer of interest on a carrier substrate having the form of a thin cantilevered reed. Low external losses and an exceptionally good span of operating frequencies are obtained by integrally bonding the substrate to a supporting pedestal and by using electrostatic drive and detection for the transverse modes of vibration. The internal friction can be measured with relatively simply instrumentation, at pressures below 10−5 torr (1.33 × 10−3 Pa) and over the temperature range −190°C to 550°C. The apparatus has considerable versatility for work in a number of areas, including the investigation of metallic foils prepared by splat-cooling."
"The Hall masterslice transducer combines modern IC (integrated circuit) technology with a modular design concept to provide a flexible multifunction approach to magnetic sensing. Its sensing element, a controllable Hall cell, is integrated with the associated circuitry on a masterslice chip, mounted in a flux concentrator module that forms the basic building block for diverse application packages. The device has several auxiliary control electrodes that allow fixed or externally variable offset voltage control and magnetic field simulation, as well as threshold, hysteresis, and gain adjustments. Integral flux concentrators provide the module with an efficient magnetic flux path and chip cooling. Three application categories—switches, proximity sensors, and current sensors—are discussed and various application package designs are presented."
"Stack processing, and in particular stack processing for the least recently used replacement algorithms, may present computational problems when it is applied to a sequence of page references with many different pages. This paper describes a new technique for LRU stack processing that permits efficient processing of these sequences. An analysis of the algorithm and a comparison of its running times with those of the conventional stack processing algorithms are presented. Finally we discuss a multipass implementation, which was found necessary to process trace data from a large data base system."
"We consider NRZI waveform codes that satisfy a given set of run-length constraints and the upper bound on the accumulated dc charge of the waveform. These constraints enable the codeword to be self-clocking, ac-coupled, and suitable for data processing tape and communication applications. Various aspects of synthesis and analysis of such codes, called (d, k, C) codes, are illustrated by means of several examples. The choice of the initial state of the encoder is shown to influence the length of the data sequence over which the encoder must look-ahead."
"This paper deals with waveform encoding methods in which binary data are mapped into constrained binary sequences for shaping the frequency spectrum of corresponding waveforms. Short and long pulse widths in the waveform are limited by constraints on the minimum and maximum run-lengths of zeros in the coded sequences. These constraints reduce the intersymbol interference in magnetic recording and provide an adequate rate of transition for accurate clocking. Signal power at low frequencies is limited by means of a constraint on a parameter that corresponds to the maximum imbalance in the number of positive and negative pulses of the waveform. This constraint on the maximum accumulated dc charge also eliminates the zero-frequency component. Zero modulation is one such code that is especially suitable for magnetic recording channels. The encoding and decoding algorithm is presented. A one-to-one correspondence between binary data and constrained sequences is established by creating data states that are isomorphic to the charge states having the same growth rate. Sequences with other values of run-length and charge constraint are examined as candidates for other codes with zero dc component."
"This paper describes the circuit design of a programmable logic array chip using four-phase dynamic circuits, operating at a nominal cycle time of 230 nanoseconds. Bootstrap circuit techniques are used to obtain high function and performance by satisfying some special requirements of PLA designs. These include a simple means for two-bit partitioning of the data inputs, a noninverting buffer circuit between precharged arrays, and a fast, compact on-chip driver for heavily loaded arrays. Multiphase clocking enables the use of master/slave type JK flip-flops with minimum circuitry and power dissipation. A polarity hold function is provided at the outputs to allow interfacing the dynamic design to static output circuits."
"An interpolation procedure, which uses a step function plus a polynomial correction, is devised and studied for application to the numerical solution of problems having discontinuous solutions. We apply the interpolation procedure to the calculation of shock waves produced by a single convex conservation law. The resulting algorithm does not have the usual undesirable numerical features associated with shock-wave calculations. The stability and convergence of the algorithm is also demonstrated."
"A series of techniques is being developed to postprocess noisy, multifont, nonformatted OCR data on a word basis to 1) determine if a field is alphabetic or numeric; 2) verify that an alphabetic word is legitimate; 3) fetch from a dictionary a set of potential entries using a garbled word as a key; and 4) error-correct the garbled word by selecting the most likely dictionary word. Four algorithms were developed using a technique called vector processing (representing alphabetic words as numeric vectors) and also by applying Bayes maximum likelihood solutions to correct the OCR output. The result was the development of a software simulator which processed sequential fields generated by the Advanced Optical Character Reader (in use by the U.S. Postal Service in New York City), performed the four functions indicated above, and selected the correct alphabetic word from a dictionary of 62,000 entries."
"A series of experiments shows that substitution of Bi into antiferromagnetic MnRh causes this alloy to become ferromagnetic. The Curie temperature of (Mn0.8Bi0.2)Rh is 185°K and the moment is 3.5 µB per formula unit. Substitution of Te instead of Bi gives similar results. This effect is consistent with a model of competitive ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange in MnRh-type compounds."
"The writer believes that unique interpretation of the results in the subject paper [1] is likely only under severely modified assumptions."

  "In a computer system there is a wide spectrum of actions that are to be performed simultaneously in order to maximize throughput and minimize the response time of the system. The diversity of action and reaction which takes place in a large computer system presents serious problems to anyone trying to encompass that entire spectrum. No single theory of optimization-finding the best way to carry out an action to produce a specific result-embraces all the important aspects because each domain of application has unique characteristics that determine the most appropriate approach. There are many problems of long-standing interest which have eluded solution, partly because the problems have not been clearly defined and partly because the most significant parameters to be used in tractable models have not been identified. The eight papers in this issue introduce some important and novel concepts in the analysis and design of computer systems. New viewpoints have been developed for the analysis of significant aspects such as multiprocessing, multiprogramming, system communication, storage management, scheduling, and validation of simulation models. The concepts presented in this group of papers contain numerous warnings and restrictions, which serve to call attention to those aspects of the discussion that must be modified in order to represent in a more realistic manner the physical processes of existing systems. Success in the application of the described models depends on careful formulation by the user and an understanding of the assumptioas and restrictions involved in their use."
"A multiprocessing system composed of identical units is considered. This system is executing a set of partially ordered tasks, with known execution times, using a non-preemptive scheduling strategy. Lower bounds on the number of processors required to compute the tasks before a deadline, and on the minimum time to execute the tasks with a fixed number of processors, are of great value for the determination of the corresponding optimal schedules. In this paper, methods for the efficient computation of the lower bounds obtained by Fernández and Bussell are discussed. Computational improvements for the case of general partial orders are reported, and further reductions of the number of operations are shown to be possible for special graphs (trees, independent chains, independent tasks)."
"An algorithm to divide the main memory among N competing programs with different characteristics, running in a multiprogramming and virtual memory environment, is proposed. The algorithm is based on an optimal allocation policy, which is derived in this paper, using the concept of the working set. A brief description of the hardware implementation of the algorithm is also presented. It is shown that under this optimal allocation policy “the value of a page-frame” (the amount of reduction in the page fault rate if an additional page frame is allocated to that program) to each program is the same."
"In this paper, we investigate the effect that the shape of the lifetime function has on the optimal partition of the main memory of a computer among N programs, where the criterion of optimality is maximization of CPU utilization. We used a simple queuing model as a base for understanding this interrelationship. The lifetime function is the average of the execution intervals of a program as a function of the amount of memory allocated. When the lifetime function is convex and is proportional to mα, where m is the size of memory, then the optimal partition is obtained by dividing the main memory equally among q of the N programs (q is the optimal degree of multiprogramming). Thus, the best partition is always one of two policies; allocate all memory equally among the q programs or allocate all memory to one program. When the lifetime function has a degenerate S shape (is proportional to mα when m ≤ m0 and remains constant beyond m0), then there exists a memory size m such that no program can have a memory other than m or m0 if any program has a memory size greater than m0 each other program should have a memory size that is equal to or greater than m0"
"A recently developed method for estimating confidence intervals when simulating stochastic systems having a regenerative structure is reviewed. The paper is basically tutorial, but also considers the pragmatic issue of the simulation duration required to obtain valid estimates. The method is illustrated in terms of simulating the M/G/1 queue. Analytic results for the M/G/1 queue are used to determine the validity of the simulation results."
"Recently, techniques have been developed for estimating confidence intervals when simulating stochastic systems having a regenerative structure. These techniques are applied to the simulation of a queuing model of a computer system's automated tape library. Theoretical and practical issues related to the application of these techniques are addressed. An interesting feature of the automated tape library represented in the queuing model is that certain queues have finite capacity; when these queues are filled to capacity certain services are prevented from occurring. The regenerative techniques are used in conjunction with multiple comparison procedures to make statistically valid statements about the effect of the finite queue capacities on performance."
"A queuing model with two sequential servers is developed to analyze performance in computer and communication systems. In one case the CPU is the first server and the terminal and its associated communications equipment are the second server. In a second case the CPU and the channel are the first server and the auxiliary storage device is the second server. We study the queuing behavior of the sequential server systems with Poisson arrivals, general service time distributions, and several service disciplines, including bulk arrivals, message priorities, and the input and output queues. The stationary distributions of the queue lengths and waiting times are determined by using an imbedded Markov chain analysis. Several examples are given to illustrate the applications of these models to practical problems."
"A finite population, multi-queue model is developed for a loop transmission system. Approximate expressions for the state transition matrix and other system variables are derived in recursive forms. It is also shown that a number of useful system parameters, such as average message response time, average cycle time, and average response time conditioned on message length, can be obtained. The analytical results have been validated by simulation."
"In order to fulfill response time constraints in real-time systems, demands are often handled by means of sophisticated scheduling strategies. This paper first shows how to describe and analyze arbitrary combinations of preemptive and non-preemptive (head-of-the-line) priority strategies and, second, presents an algorithm that yields the optimal priority strategy, taking into consideration constraints on the response time."

  "After a discussion of the reasons for choosing to implement logic in array form, a detailed description of the nature of array logic is given. Topics specifically discussed include general array structures and implementation, influence of decoder partitioning, design of logic arrays, output phase, “split” variables, feedback in logic arrays, and reconfiguration."
"Large Scale Integration, LSI, is the means by which digital circuits have achieved remarkable manufacturing cost reductions but, unfortunately, at the expense of higher engineering design costs. Programmable Logic Arrays, PLAs, exploit many of the benefits of LSI but without the high engineering design costs. This paper describes an experiment in the design and implementation of a small complex system in array logic. The IBM 7441 Buffered Terminal Control Unit was selected for this comparison because it is a small but complex terminal controller implemented in dual in-line packaged transistor logic, DIP-TL, with small to medium scale integration."
"A macro design approach is discussed which combines the cost-effective attributes of array logic structures with those of random logic. These macros utilize the following features: (a) internal feedback registers for performing sequential logic, (b) masking and submasking to reduce the number of words in the array for certain functions, (c) control of the array's output level to vary the apparent size of the array, (d) decoding on input pairs and/or exclusive oring on output pairs for increasing the number of logic levels, and (e) random-access memory in the feedback and its use in interrupt handling. The macros are explained by specific design examples. This paper also discusses standard logic circuits in combination with an array structure to produce a component that can be used efficiently in specific data processing areas. The designer may elect to define an array logic macro which is a combination of some of the features given in this paper. The guideline for this selection is based upon the features necessary in an array structure to be competitive with a random logic LSI chip."
"The temperature dependence of the polarization in thin phosphosilicate glass (PSG) films is characterized by an activation energy ΔH = (0.39 + 0.039Et) eV, whereas the decay mechanism has an activation energy of 0.5 eV. The flatband voltage shift due to PSG polarization was linear with applied fields as large as 5.5 × 106 V · cm−1. The effective time constants for the polarization and depolarization are distinctly different. Polarization occurs an order of magnitude faster than depolarization. A physical model has been postulated to explain the observed effects."
"The goal of storage hierarchies is to combine several storage technologies in such a way as to approach the performance of the fastest component technology and the cost of the least expensive one. This paper presents optimization techniques for a storage hierarchy subject to quantity-sensitive component costs. It is assumed that a finite (and probably small) set of technologies is available. Each technology is characterized by an access time and two cost parameters. We assume that statistical summaries of address sequences are available. We present solutions to four problems of increasing complexity: 1) minimization of access time for a fixed cost and preassigned page sizes; 2) optimization of a generalized price-performance function under preassigned page sizes; 3) minimization of access time for a fixed cost when page sizes are allowed to vary; 4) optimization of a generalized price-performance function when page sizes are allowed to vary."
"Data base statistics play an important role in conventional information compression. For a large data base, the acquisition of data base statistics becomes a very difficult task. This paper presents a new scheme for information compression that does not use information statistics. Each information block is represented by two sub-blocks called the alphabet and the generator. The alphabet contains the linearly independent elements; the generator is computed through the linear combination of the linearly dependent elements. The total length of these two sub-blocks is generally shorter (never greater) than the original block."
"A high speed bipolar transistor has been fabricated by using double base diffusion to reduce the base resistance RB. The base resistance forms two important time constants, RBCD and RBCC(RL/RE) with the emitter diffusion capacitance CD and collector capacitance CC dominating the switching delay of the circuits. We demonstrate that the base resistance of a single base diffused device can be reduced by a factor of four by using double base diffusion without affecting its cut-off frequency ft = 7 GHz. The double base diffusion also increases the punchthrough voltage of the device from 3 to 7V."
"Misfit dislocations in epitaxially grown layers of GaAs1−xPx with a lattice constant gradient are examined by transmission electron microscopy. In specimens with (113) A growth planes, they form a three-dimensional arrangement of glissile and sessile dislocations. Cross slip is an important process in the generation of the dislocations. High resolution microscopy shows 1) glissile dislocations dissociated into partial dislocations and 2) undissociated sessile Lomer dislocations. These differences are attributed to contributions to the dislocation core energy from wrong bonds and dangling bonds. Screw dislocations are also thought to be undissociated, which facilitates cross slip and multiplication of dislocations."
"In intuitive terms, a multilevel array is either a scalar or an array each of whose elements is a multilevel array. The “semantics” of multilevel arrays can be easily expressed in terms of a notion of selector, which is basically that of the Vienna Definition Language. These selectors provide both a notational device for accessing multilevel arrays and a clean mathematical definition of “multilevel array with data domain D.” However, the definition so obtained lacks the recursive flavor of the intuitive definition. By means of an axiomatic characterization of multilevel arrays, the selector-based definition and the recursive definition are shown to be equivalent."
"This paper reviews a dynamic programming procedure for the partitioning of connected graphs with integer-weighted nodes and positive valued edges. The upper bound on the number of feasible partitions generated using this technique is shown to grow factorially in the number of graph nodes. The use of graph properties is then introduced to reduce the number of feasible partitions generated in the determination of the optimal partition. Depending upon the structure of the graph, the use of these properties can cause a significant reduction in the computation time and storage space required to partition the graph."
"A method is described that allows the translation of a traditionally written (unstructured) program into a set of top-down structured, semantically founded, GOTO-free modules. The method reveals not only the logic of a given program in a most natural way, but it also reduces code duplication to a minimum. It is further shown how the obtained structured program can be mapped back into a GOTO program in such a way that all GOTOs are backwards branches and their number is minimal. The connection between recursively and iteratively structured programs is demonstrated using the WHILE, DO FOREVER, and multilevel EXIT statements. Extensions of the method show the structuring of source programs containing block structures and subroutines."

   "Performance evaluation in its most general sense is closely related to operations research — both are concerned with decisionmaking for situations encountered in a wide spectrum of applications. The pressing need to allocate limited resources invokes the use of performance evaluation techniques in engineering, business, economics, and social and environmental sciences, as well as in other aspects of life."
"The Page Survival Index (PSI) was defined in a preceding paper where it was used to describe the behavior of individual programs running in a time sharing environment. Here we show how a system-wide value of PSI can be calculated on the fly by the operating system. This value can be used to estimate users’ memory requirements and to control system performance by maintaining the proper multiprogramming level. Simulation results show that a scheduler based on these concepts can achieve significant improvements in system performance."
"Empirical analyses of data on working set size are reported. The data do not support the hypothesis that working set sizes are normally distributed. The data suggest various algorithms for predicting working set size based on the program's past history. Several representative algorithms are discussed and evaluated."
"This paper describes a study of some of the characteristics of program referencing patterns. Program behavior is investigated by constructing stochastic models for the page reference mechanism and evaluating the validity of the assumptions made through comparison with empirical results. The notion of a regime process is shown to play a useful role in describing the observed phenomena mathematically. The study falls within the realm of a rapidly growing field of computer science known as compumetrics, where quantitative and qualitative methods are being applied to the study and evaluation of computer performance."
"This paper considers the premise that, in addition to trying to solve the virtual-memory-system performance problem by devising a storage management strategy suitable for the broad spectrum of behavior exhibited by programs, efforts also be made to tailor the behavior of each program to the model underlying the storage management strategy under which the program will have to run. It is observed that a viable approach to program tailoring is offered by restructuring techniques. The application of dynamic off-line techniques to the tailoring problem is discussed, and an algorithm which may be used to fit program behavior to the working set model is described in detail as an example. The performance of this algorithm in dealing with two real-program traces is experimentally evaluated under a variety of conditions and found to be always satisfactory."
"A common problem encountered in computer system simulation is that of validating that the simulator can produce, with a reasonable degree of accuracy, the same information that can be obtained from the modeled system. This is basically a statistical problem because there are usually limitations with respect to the number of controlled tests that can be carried out, and assessment of the fidelity of the model is a function of the signal to noise ratio. That is, the magnitude of error which can be tolerated depends upon the size of the effect to be predicted. In this paper we describe, by example, how techniques of statistical design and analysis of experiments have been used to validate the modeling of the dispatching algorithm of a time sharing system. The examples are based on a detailed, trace-driven simulator of CP-67. They show that identical factorial experiments involving parameters of this algorithm, when carried out on both the simulator and on the actual system, produced statistically comparable effects."
"A combination of analytical modeling and measurement is employed for the performance analysis of a multiprogrammed computer system. First, a cyclic queue model is developed for the system under study. Then, model validation is attempted in both controlled and normal environments. The success of the model is demonstrated by its prediction of performance improvements from system reconfigurations. Reasonable correlation between the measured performance and the model predictions under various degrees of multiprogramming is observed. Finally, possible system reconfigurations are explored with the insight gained from the performance analysis."
"A response time analysis for a general class of terminals-to-computer subsystem is presented in this paper. The model used is based on the most advanced data communications system in which terminals are connected to Terminal Control Units (TCU) that are in turn connected to local Front-End Processors (FEP). The line control procedures used to interface a TCU and an FEP may be half-duplex Binary Synchronous Communications (BSC), half-duplex Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC), or full-duplex SDLC. The models presented here can be used to determine bottlenecks in the entire system and to facilitate the initial phase of system design and configuration."
"In this paper a recent result of Baskett, Chandy, Muntz, and Palacios is generalized to the case in which customer transitions are characterized by more than one closed Markov chain. Generating functions are used to derive closed-form solutions to stability, normalization constant, and marginal distributions. For such a system with N servers and L chains the solutions are considerably more complicated than those for systems with one subchain only. It is shown how open and closed subchains interact with each other in such systems. Efficient algorithms are then derived from our generating function representation."
"A recursive method for efficient computational analysis of a wide class of queuing problems is presented. Interarrival and service times are described by multidimensional Markovian processes while arrival and service rates are allowed to be state dependent."
"Service time distributions at computer processing units are often nonexponential. Empirical studies show that different programs may have markedly different processing time requirements. When queuing disciplines are first come, first served, preemptive priority or nonpreemptive priority, models reflecting these characteristics are difficult to analyze exactly. Available approximate techniques are often too expensive for parametric analysis. Inexpensive approximate techniques for solution of central server models with the above characteristics are presented. The results of these techniques are validated with simulation results."
"A computer system can usually be interpreted as a closed network with two different types of servers. It is then possible to convert the network into a single server system with state-dependent arrivals. This paper investigates the stationary behavior of a single server queue with different classes of jobs. It is assumed that the input process has state-dependent exponential inter-arrival times and preemptions at the server are not allowed. The exact solution is obtained by finding the relationship between the time average probability distribution and the departure average probability distribution. The latter can be derived, based upon an imbedded Markov Chain."

    "An algorithm is described for obtaining an optimal approximation, using triangulation, of a three-dimensional surface defined by randomly distributed points along contour lines. The combinatorial problem of finding the best arrangement of triangles is treated by assuming an adequate objective function. The optimal triangulation is found using classical methods of graph theory. An illustrative example gives the procedure for triangulation of contour lines of a human head for use in radiation therapy planning."
"One principle of structured programming is that a program should be separated into meaningful independent subprograms, which are then combined so that the relation of the parts to the whole can be clearly established. This paper describes several alternative ways to compose programs. The main method used is to permit the programmer to denote by an expression the sequence of values taken on by a variable. The sequence is represented by a function called a stream, which is a functional analog of a coroutine. The conventional while and for loops of structured programming may be composed by a technique of stream processing (analogous to list processing), which results in more structured programs than the originals. This technique makes it possible to structure a program in a natural way into its logically separate parts, which can then be considered independently."
"A storage management scheme is described that supports the invalidation of addresses to freed storage and thus, in that sense, provides a secure system. Unlike previous virtual memory techniques, the allocated areas of our scheme can vary from the very large, requiring multiple pages of storage, to the very small, in which several can be contained on a single page. Special treatment is accorded procedure activation storage so as to provide increased effectiveness for this important case. The interaction of this deletion scheme with garbage collection techniques is also examined. Finally, the relative advantages of retention and deletion strategies of storage management are considered."
"We consider a queuing network with M exponential service stations and with N customers. We study the behavior of a subsystem σ, which has a single node as input and a single node as output, when the subsystem parameters are varied. An “equivalent” network is constructed in which all queues except those in subsystem σ are replaced by a single composite queue. We show that for certain classes of system parameters, the behavior of subsystem σ in the equivalent network is the same as in the given network. The analogy to Norton's theorem in electrical circuit theory is demonstrated. In addition, the equivalent network analysis can be applied to open exponential networks."
"An approximate iterative technique for the analysis of complex queuing networks with general service times is presented. The technique is based on an application of Norton's theorem from electrical circuit theory to queuing networks which obey local balance. The technique determines approximations of the queue length and waiting time distributions for each queue in the network. Comparison of results obtained by the approximate method with simulated and exact results shows that the approximate method has reasonable accuracy."
"Device design considerations are presented for ion implanted, n-channel, polysilicon gate, enhancement-mode MOSFETs for dynamic switching applications. A shallow channel implant is used to raise the magnitude of the gate threshold voltage while also maintaining a low substrate sensitivity (i.e., without substantially increasing the dependence of the threshold voltage on the source-to-substrate “backgate” bias). Design trade-offs between channel implantation energy and dose and substrate bias were examined using both computer analyses and experimental devices. The design objective was to identify the combination of these three parameter values that gives both a low substrate sensitivity and a steep subthreshold conduction characteristic under the conditions of a gate threshold voltage of 1 V and a substrate bias range of 0 to −1 V. One-dimensional and two-dimensional computer analyses were performed to predict the effect of the device parameters on the electrical characteristics. MOSFETs were then fabricated to investigate the extremes of the design parameter range, and the experimental and predicted device characteristics were compared. An enclosed device structure proved particularly useful in evaluating the subthreshold characteristic at very low values of drain current."
"A keyboard method is described that allows a user to form Chinese characters. The user's keystrokes activate internal logic, which performs the necessary scaling and positioning of the character components. An initial design using a 40-key keyboard is described, together with approximations of the character shapes produced by given keying sequences. Rough estimates of speed range from eight to 33 characters per minute."
"Identification and representation of entities and their relationships relevant to an application are some of the key problems in logical data base design. This paper presents an approach to synthesizing logical segments that are representations of such entities and relationships. The major steps in this design are 1) collect all the pertinent functional relations in the application domain; 2) remove redundant relations to obtain a minimal covering set; 3) minimize the number of relations in the covering set to obtain an optimal set of relations in the third normal form; and 4) combine relations into logical segments according to prescribed performance requirements and projected information maintenance activities. Synthesis of logical segments for an airline reservations application is used as an illustrative example."
"This paper presents formulas for calculating waiting time for customers in a queue with combined preemptive and head-of-line (nonpreemptive) priority scheduling disciplines and describes the reasoning behind them. This work has been applied in the development of programmable terminal control units."

   "A revised dispatch procedure for power is described that meets the demand for energy while accounting for both cost and emission considerations. First, a tradeoff curve, representing all alternative dispatch policies, is derived for each demand level. Since air pollution damage is a function of the spatial distribution of pollutants in the atmosphere, an air pollution diffusion model is utilized in order to evaluate each dispatch policy on the tradeoff curve from an air impact point of view. Under the postulate of rational behavior, the utility function of the decision maker can be described by a quasi-concave function whose maximum point is found among points on the tradeoff curve. An interactive search method, based on the golden section search technique, is then devised in order to guide the decision maker toward finding the dispatch policy that maximizes his utility function."
"Multiloop response properties of controllers are, in general, very difficult to obtain because an independent forcing function is needed for each describing function to be measured, and interpolation procedures may be required to obtain intermediate describing functions at common frequencies. Even then, a certain amount of untangling is required before the final results are obtained. When the loops that are closed and the nature of the describing function forms adopted in each loop are known or hypothesized, matters can be made much simpler. Then, the quantitative values of the individual describing functions can be readily identified using appropriate closed-loop describing function measures and decomposition procedures. Two examples are provided for the measurement of driver-vehicle multiloop response properties using a single disturbance input. The validity of the procedure is based on current multiloop operator adjustment rules and is made plausible by comparison with experimental data."
"A fixed-base simulation has been developed to test the effect of alcohol on driving performance. The simulation includes both lateral steering control and a discrete visual detection, recognition, and response task set up to provide the workload and division of attention typical of real world driving. Measurements of both driver control behavior and driver-vehicle performance were obtained for the steering task, and detection and recognition indexes and reaction time were measured on the discrete task. Preliminary results on scanning behavior as measured with an eye-point-of-regard monitor are also presented. Data are given for eighteen drivers, ranging in age from 21-65, at blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) of 0, 0.06, and 0.11. Alcohol causes larger lane and heading deviations, and increases detection and reaction times on the discrete task. Control-behavior measures show that the driver's control gain decreases, but stability margins are maintained under alcohol, while driver remnant increases. Such effects could be due to indifference thresholds and/or intermittent attention in the control task. Both continuous steering control and discrete peripheral ``sign'' response tasks were performed, singly and combined, to investigate the effects of divided attention. Performance on the steering control task was decreased when both tasks were done concurrently, but the sensitivity to alcohol effects was similar. The driving simulation has proven an efficient tool for alcohol research. It has gained acceptance from subjects as a valid approximation of driving, and the various related measurements have proven to be reliable and sensitive to levels of intoxication."
"Two projects have been carried out to study the application of human operator describing functions in the investigation of the influence of drugs (alcohol and marijuana) on subjects performing a compensatory visual-manual tracking task. The describing functions were measured through the application of power spectral density techniques to the signals circulating in the control loop. A range of drug dosages was employed which included alcohol alone, marijuana alone, and a combined dose of marijuana and alcohol. Significant alterations in the describing functions were observed and interpreted as changes in amplitude, phase, and operator injected noise (remnant). Linear models fitted to the raw describing function data are used to summarize the observed trends in the human operator's dynamic characteristics. The results provide an insight into the changes in human performance produced by alcohol and marijuana."
"A mathematical model of document assembly using a computerized word processing system is introduced. In this process the operator prepares a typed document by assembling it from segments of text which are either retrieved from a file and copied on to the document or retyped by the operator. This model is used to obtain the optimal operation strategy, and the expected processing time as a function of the document's length and the man-machine parameters. Based on these results, some criteria are suggested for evaluating alternative word processors with respect to this application and for determining tradeoffs involved in designing such systems."
"A brief review of the principles of stereoscopy is given followed by a discussion of candidate methods for providing stereoscopic viewing of display data. An analog computer implementation of a stereoscopic graphics display system is described. The analog implementation provides real-time display capability but has no data storage capability. Implementation with a small digital computer provides data storage but is significantly slower for displaying dynamic changes in the data. Other points of comparison between the two systems are given with the conclusion that a hybrid system would combine good features of both. Experimental evaluation relative to eye fatigue is given for three specific viewing techniques. Example stereograms are given for both the digital and analog systems. Of particular interest was application of the display system for viewing biomedical data, as illustrated by an example display of a vectorcardiogram."
"The discriminability of small changes in amplitude and frequency of a pure tone auditory stimulus is examined in terms of statistical estimators of neural coding parameters. The neural spike train encoding process is described in terms of a multimodal histogram of interspike intervals. Such a multimodal process has the important property that both stimulus amplitude and stimulus frequency can be encoded in the same spike train. Performance of the neural coding parameters is evaluated using the Cramér-Rao bound as a measure of discriminability of statistical estimators. The dependence of the Weber fraction for stimulus frequency and stimulus amplitude is derived as a function of frequency, amplitude, and observation interval. These results are compared to results of psychophysical experiments. It is concluded that while statistical estimates based on one primary auditory nerve fiber would be insufficient to account for psychophysical performance, estimates based on about 10-12 fibers sampled in parallel would be sufficient."
"A statistical distribution is reported for the lengths of Ph.D. programs from which are derived functions analogous to those of elementary reliability theory. These show that the anticipated future duration of these research programs does not decrease uniformly, so that there are diminishing returns from further work almost to the point where the expected date of completion remains a constant distance in the future."
"An algorithm has been developed that efficiently solves a large class of robot navigation and obstacle avoidance problems using range information as its sole input from the environment. The system resides in a minicomputer and requires very small memory (1500 words) and computing time (1.35 s) allocations while solving simulated problems of broadly ranging spatial complexity and operational intricacy. It is thus a prime candidate for use in mobile robots or manipulators where real-time operation is desired."
"An on-off sequence of an unknown signal pattern that is time-varying or fixed is dealt with. The optimum analogue feedback signal is obtained, which minimizes the average energy transmitted in the forward direction. The nonsupervised situation is also discussed. The effectiveness of the feedback method over the nonfeedback method is twice for the typical case."
"This correspondence presents a procedure for generating correlated random variables with specified non-Gaussian probability distribution functions (pdf's) such as might be required for Monte Carlo simulation studies. Specifically, a method is presented for generating an arbitrary number of pseudorandom numbers each with a prescribed probability distribution and with a prescribed correlation coefficient matrix for the collection of random numbers. Collections of typical numbers generated with the method are evaluated with chi-squared tests for the distribution functions and with confidence intervals for the correlation coefficients derived from maximum likelihood estimates. In all cases tested the generated numbers passed the tests."
"In order to assemble mechanical parts which are initially disordered, a computer-controlled manipulator needs some procedure for orienting these parts. An apparatus is described which assists the manipulator in performing this function. The device is a dihedrally tipped open box attached to a vibrator. When placed in the box, a typical mechanical part assumes one of a small finite number of possible orientations. Once the particular orientation is established, the manipulator shifts the part into the desired orientation."
"It is shown that a stationary distribution of a regular Markov chain can be obtained directly from its transition graph. The technique is similar to signal flow-graph methods, however, it uses trees of the graph rather than loops. The proof is direct and simple."

"A probabilistic automaton based on competing evolutionary search processes is considered as an on-line real-time adaptive controller for complex plants with multimodal performance index structures that are modified under measurable but uncontrollable random environmental variations. The scheme described includes mechanisms of storage and retrieval to take advantage of control experience gained prior to any current situation."
"Dynamic water quality modeling methodology is presented along with a number of applications of optimization theory to deterministic water quality modeling and control. Two of the applications are basically parameter estimation problems. The first involves the generation of a dynamic model for the behavior of coliform bacteria in Grand Traverse Bay, while the second is concerned with the estimation of parameters in an existing model for the growth of bacteria in organic carbon limited media. The third application utilizes the proposition that the laws of nature are in some sense optimal to aid in the characterization of an algae inhibition function. The basic problem involves the development of a model of phytoplankton succession in lakes involving two species of algae and two nutrients. An unknown algal inhibition function is treated as an unknown control that is to be determined to minimize the loss of nutrients from the system, which is considered as an approximate optimality principle for the system. The resultant solution possesses an optimal singular subarc that has an interesting ecological interpretation. An active control application utilizing the same model is also presented."
"A procedure is proposed which allows one to assess the adequacy of models to represent objects. Only the class of inverse problems has been considered in detail. The procedure is based on the definition of a vectorial distance between models. It allows one to order models from the standpoint of their adequacy and apply to the problem many results of ordered sets. When the set of models admits a minimum, this generally coincides with the most adequate model. Otherwise, the most adequate model has to be found with the methods of decision theory. The method may sometimes be cumbersome. It is shown, however, that this fact may represent a useful feature of the method. Moreover, it is shown that most of the existing work on the adequacy of models, even if in embryo, agrees quite well with the proposed framework."
"Two algorithms for error analysis of nonlinear continuous simulations are derived and presented. A first-order algorithm is developed initially, and its relationship to standard sensitivity algorithms is indicated. This is followed by the development of a Monte Carlo simulation algorithm. The limitations and computational efficiencies of each are discussed and compared. Both algorithms are developed under the assumptions of uncertainty in the inputs to the model, certainty in the accuracy and adequacy of model structure. Simulation techniques for accommodating situations where the latter assumption is not good are then discussed. Using the Forrester world model [1] as the vehicle of demonstration, the techniques show what maximal amount of error can be tolerated in the inputs in order to retain a given accuracy in the outputs."
"An algorithm for finding a continuous-time linear analog to a discrete-time linear system is derived. It is employed in the selection of optimal economic policy, and an example using Samuelson's multiplier-accelerator model is described."
"In a society, decisions often affect groups of people instead of isolated individuals. In such cases, planners and decision makers are usually expected to consider the preferences of Previous approaches to the problem of amalgamating the individual preferences into a form which can be used to guide the decision maker are surveyed, and the role worth assessment plays in the group decision making problem is considered. Our approach here is to define the problem of group decision making and develop acceptable methodologies to treat the problem. Arrow has presented a set of conditions which acceptable methodologies should satisfy, and we use those conditions as our guide. Black has considered the case of single-peaked preferences and majority rule as acceptable methodologies, and we also examine his work. We extend the concept of single-peaked preferences to the problem of selecting a numerical quantity from a continuous interval. We arbitrarily define the mean as an acceptable social welfare function for such a case. We then couple the mean with the method of majority voting for two alternatives to create a procedure for assessment of the worth of complex alternatives by a group. Applications to worth assessment are discussed."
      "A conceptual framework for applying artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in computer-assisted instruction (CAI) is described. The student progresses through four phases (``faces'') of interaction with the computer acting as ``benevolent mentor,'' ``cognizant tool,'' ``problem-solving partner,'' and ``learner.'' The first phase serves to introduce the problem space, with the computer initiating as well as responding to inquiries. In the second phase, the computer provides the student with a set of tools which amplify his problem-solving ability. The third phase employs the computer as a partner, supporting a joint problem-solving endeavor. Finally, the computer plays the role of a learner, and the student learns by teaching it how to solve new problems. Each phase has an analog in general problem-solving techniques, namely, problem representation, heuristic search, directed search, and formal algorithmic expression. Taken together, the four phases comprise an integrated educational system for using AI in CAI. The system is illustrated within the problem space of cryptography, and applications to several other subject areas are cited."
"Parallel web automata (PWA)-a generalization of cellular arrays to arbitrary graph structures-are defined. It is shown that such automata make poor acceptors (i.e., they are not good recognizers of their own graph structures). However, they can be used to perform parallel local pattern matching (with respect to patterns of bounded size) on themselves, so that they have potential usefulness as models for ''semantic memory.'' They can also be used to find greatest compatible sets of graph labelings subject to given local constraints; this problem arises, for example, in the analysis of scenes containing three-dimensional objects."
"Regions in a picture that differ texturally from their surroundings can often be extracted by 1) applying a local operation to every point of the picture, 2) averaging the results, and 3) thresholding. This approach will usually not work if there are too many differently textured regions present, since the average for one type of region may then be indistinguishable from the average resulting from a mixture of two other types that adjoin. The amount of averaging that should be used depends on the coarseness of the texture. An approach to choosing this amount automatically was investigated, but the results were not as good as those obtained with a fixed high degree of averaging."
"This correspondence estimates the risks of k-nearest-neighbor decision rules on classification of vocal utterances. The data are available upon request."
"Although motion is one of the most fundamental aspects of the visual world, its use has not been widely explored in the field of scene description. This correspondence describes a program that demonstrates the feasibility of segmenting a scene into regions on the basis of velocity. A velocity measure is obtained by determining the amount of displacement of a reference feature between two pictures of the same scene. The pictures are taken only a short time apart so that the reference features can be correlated between the pictures on the basis of spatial position alone. This velocity measurement is associated with absolute reference points superimposed over the scene. It is assumed that all parts of an object have the same velocity measurement. Thus the velocity measurements associated with the reference points provide a means of classifying them as ``belonging'' to the same object. Points ``inside'' moving objects fall into either of two velocity measurement classes, which are easily correlated. Since the velocity of an object is independent of its color, a scene is segmented into regions that contain complete objects even if the objects are not monochromatic."
"A modification of a simple clustering method is described, and its performance is improved considerably in a number of cases with practically the same amount of computation. The method is based on dimensionwise application of the original method. An example is shown."
"Optimal preventive maintenance policies, for a machine subject to deterioration with age and intermittent breakdowns and repairs, are derived using optimal control theory. The optimal policies are shown to be of bang-bang nature. The extension to the case when there are a large number of identical machines and several repairmen in the system is considered next. This model takes into account the waiting line formed at the repair facility and establishes a link between this problem and the classical ``repairmen problem.''"
"Shannon's mutual information is proposed as a measure of lagged statistical dependence between the temporal patterns of economic/demographic growth for subregions, where the year-to-year ratio of births is taken as the growth index for each subregion. Application of the measure to 31 of the 36 counties in Oregon, using vital statistics for the years 1919-1968, yields results that seem, for the most part, consistent with certain theories about the diffusion of economic development."
"An interactive programming system for the generation of man-computer dialogues is introduced. The system consists of an integrated set of tools that are used to define and generate the software for a variety of dialogues. The system is capable of generating dialogues for computer-assisted instruction (CAI), data processing, and the programming of special-purpose applications."

"Inference of high-dimensional grammars is discussed. Specifically, techniques for inferring tree grammars are briefly presented. The problem of inferring a stochastic grammar to model the behavior of an information source is also introduced and techniques for carrying out the inference process are presented for a class of stochastic finite-state and context-free grammars. The possible practical application of these methods is illustrated by examples."
"An approach to the analysis of the effects of display parameters on manual control based on an optimal control model of the human operator and a related model for task interference is presented. The methodology allows one to predict the effects of changes in display variables on both performance and attentional demand or workload. The methodology is applied to vertical situation displays for STOL (short takeoff and landing) approach-to-landing. Both status displays and displays of command information are examined and compared in terms of approach success probability and workload requirements."
"A hypothesis is proposed that predicts regions where fixations are most likely to occur on a visual pattern viewed by a human test subject. A scheme is developed for evaluating a fixation probability density function for any given pattern, based on an assumed fixation probability density function for a pattern consisting of a single dot. Predictions of the hypothesis agree with experimental data available in the literature. When the hypothesis is used in conjunction with some assumptions, it also provides interpretations for some well-known geometrical illusions, such as the Muller-Lyer illusion. It is hoped that a study of this kind will aid in understanding some aspects of the mechanisms subserving human visual pattern recognition."
"A stochastic approximation method is presented for determining the parameters of a stochastic state-space model for the student enrollment vector in an educational system. As an example, the parameters of such a model are derived for the student population in the Faculty of Engineering of McMaster University, Hamilton, Ont., Canada."
"A multidimensional input-output model of a hospital's components is developed which, because it tracks the flows of people, materials, and services, can be used for long-range planning and resource allocation, and dynamic simulation of the hospital. The model also allows the determination of shadow prices, and hence, the profitability of the various hospital components."
"The detection of a difference between two n-dimensional vectors based on a noisy measurement of each vector is important for surveillance, quality control, motion detection, and other applications. Because of cost or complexity, an arbitrary reduction from n to p dimensions may be required before measurements are performed. Using a Gaussian noise assumption, the tradeoffs between detection probability and p, which we take as the measure of processing complexity, are investigated."
"The optimal control of unreliable dynamic systems where the mode (working or failed) is continuously inspected or monitored has received attention in the past. We consider the problem where instead of continuous inspection we have either no inspection or inspection at discrete time instants. The optimal feedback control is derived for the case where the system has no renewable capabilities. The case where a fixed number of renewals are allowed is briefly discussed."
"Social scientists are continually confronted with the problem of formulating models which describe how individuals make choices among alternative courses of action with uncertain consequences. Economists have developed a class of models which seem to deal particularly well with problems of this type. These models employ the ``expected utility theorem'' of von Neumann and Morgenstern and, for reasons brought out in the paper, are generally qualitative in nature. Since the approach to modeling human behavior adopted by non-economists is generally very different from that of economists, in this paper we present a rather detailed example of the role of the expected utility theorem in qualitative model building. Specifically, we model an arsonist's decision as to the amount of time to allocate to arson and related activities and examine the responsiveness of this time allocation to changes in various policy parameters. Both the activity modeled and the method of presentation are intended to provide an introduction to the scope and power of the expected utility theorem in modeling situations of ``choice under uncertainty.''"
"The problem of estimating an unknown probability density function from a sequence of samples is well known in pattern classification and many other problems. We approximate the unknown density function by a multivariable spline that is constructed from the histogram of samples. This spline function is expressed as a sum of combinatorially many terms. To assess these numerous terms, the technique of Monte Carlo sampling is exploited and a combined sampling is devised to reduce the standard error."
"In conflictual situations where two (or more) rational and intelligent players make interdependent decisions to optimize their own payoffs, decisions are often made on the basis of some critical information as well as on what each player anticipates that the other player(s) will do. How much is the critical information worth to a particular player? How much more is the same information worth to the player if he obtains the information covertly without the other player(s) knowing that he has the information? Put in another way, how much should a player be willing to offer as a maximum price to buy the critical information (or for the other player be willing to spend to safeguard the confidentiality of the same information)? How much would one player be willing to spend to find out whether the other player has the information or not? These questions are in the realm of information value theory, which, however, has not been developed in a form to answer these questions related to conflictual situations. The purpose of this paper is to extend information value theory so that such questions can be answered, at least in relatively simple cases."
"The application of pattern recognition to quality control is shown. The well-known methodology of conventional quality control is described briefly to illustrate the philosophy of quality measurement. The advantages of adopting the pattern classification approach in quality control (or quality assurance) include on-line quality monitoring without much alteration of existing conventional systems, instant diagnosis of the production process, and ultimately, automatic feedback control of the overall manufacturing process through the development of a corrective control policy."

"Many facets of the transportation picture have not been coordinated into a single interdependent model even though the long-range planning efforts of transportation systems could benefit from such an effort. The many aspects of transportation-related problems make coordinated approaches important to a critical examination of these problems. Four major sectors of the transportation ecology require this coordination effort: the transportation system design sector, the economic sector, the environmental sector, and the energy supply sector. Currently there is a growing base of crises in each of these sectors of the transportation ecology. This paper puts forth a conceptual foundation for a general transportation ecology model (a model representing the functional environment of transportation systems). The empirical and theoretical considerations necessary for the foundations, as well as the expectations of the model concept, are explored."
"The use of dynamic economic models based on the work of Leontief has received increased attention due to the current interest in the dynamic analysis of urban and world areas. Stable dynamic models have been developed and consideration of labor in these areas has been proposed. The optimum dynamic allocation of labor has also been considered. The availability of labor as the output of a sociological model has been previously developed. In this paper, an optimum allocation problem is formulated based on the previously developed economic and sociological models. This extension results in an interacting dynamic socioeconomic model."
"Criminal justice procedures admit process flow diagram representations, which in effect induce equivalences on the data available in public records. Interrogations of the data in the context of such diagrams induce further equivalences. A task for the engineer in the study of criminal justice systems is to develop data display capabilities that reconcile the requirements of these two forms of equivalences. The work reported herein describes all these concepts in detail and illustrates them for jurisdiction in St. Joseph and Marion Counties, State of Indiana."
"There is much concern over the implications of increasing population growth and resource consumption. It may be that traditional academic disciplines have not yet reoriented their goals to deal with this question in a completely satisfactory manner. With the proliferation of computers and computer technology, it is inevitable that some researchers would attempt simulations of long-term human behavior with respect to environment and resources. The great weakness of these ``simulation models'' is that they can never be validated and, therefore, cannot inspire unqualified confidence. Their great strength is that they are summaries of expert opinion and could serve as a focus for multidisciplinary research. The identification of parameters for such models is the main theme of this paper. It is shown that parameter identification, for the proper choice of a ``goodness of fit'' criterion, can be a rapid, always convergent process. This same criterion usually allows identification to occur independently for each state equation. Independence could be especially conducive to multidisciplinary human behavior model building. The technique is illustrated with an identification for a nonlinear, discrete-time simulation model (17th order) of the use of land and energy in California. This model has 80 parameters, which were identified with 150 data points and a few minutes of computer time. Only the hypothetical dynamic relations for agricultural variables need be rejected in this preliminary effort."
"The assumption that all services are weak gross substitutes was used earlier in order to show, assuming any one of a wide variety of nonnegative profit multifirm alternatives to a single regulated firm providing all services, that under certain reasonable assumptions the regulated firm is always more socially desirable in the sense that there is a vector of prices which satisfies the regulatory constraint and corresponds for each service to both a lower price and a larger quantity of service consumed. The weak-gross-substitutes assumption restricts attention to cases which, while important and of interest, are nevertheless special. In some cases the assumption is clearly not justified. Roughly speaking, here it is shown that the type of result proved earlier holds without the assumption that all services are weak gross substitutes, and that, more-over, a single regulated firm which provides all services is always more socially desirable also in the sense that it can provide each service at a higher level of quality. It is assumed that the single regulated firm possesses economies of scale in a certain special sense."
"The diffusion of an innovation such as a new communication service is modeled using a randomly generated network of interpersonal influence between members of a social system. Each member decides to adopt the innovation when K out of his particular set of L influencers have already become adopters. A discrete-time recursion is obtained which describes the evolution in time of the fraction of adopters. The model exhibits a critical mass effect, where the number of initial adopters must exceed a critical value for the diffusion to saturate the population, otherwise the diffusion ends prematurely without substantial growth. Also exhibited is a bandwagon effect, which explains a sudden upsurge in growth following an initial period of slow diffusion. Both phenomena are amply corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations for a population of 10 000 people."
"An approach to the modeling and simulation of evolving societies of individuals is advanced. The approach is based on the conjecture that a society of interacting stereotypes may retain important properties of behaviors of real societies of individuals. Each of the stereotypes in the model, although a simple deterministic approximation to real life, can be unique and be made to interact with other individuals. A model of a hypothetical six-grade elementary school is developed, and a detailed description of the model is given. A digital computer simulation of the school model is used to test the feasibility of the idea of model simplification through the use of stereotypes. An indication of the versatility of a simulation of interacting stereotypes in terms of the various outputting possibilities, the kinds of events that can be observed, and its potential for evaluating indicators is provided by a study of the results of the six-grade school simulation. In particular, observations are made of the effects of variations in the decision-making processes on individual students and faculty members over a ten-year period. The effect of changing the kinds of students enrolled in schools that are otherwise equal is also observed."
"An empirical heuristic learning identification algorithm of Ivakhnenko was modified and used to model an environmental system producing high nitrate levels in agricultural drain water in the Corn Belt. The method amounts to fitting a polynomial to a multi-input single-output response surface. The modifications result in a reduced number of terms in final model equations, a decrease in computational difficulties, and other improvements in the algorithm. This method appears to be advantageous with systems characterized by complexity with many variables and parameters, ill-defined mathematical structures, and limited data. In other words, this algorithm is useful for empirically generating hypotheses about systems of which relatively little is known."
"If f(x) and g(x) are the densities for the N-dimensional measurement vector x, conditioned on the classes c1 and c2, and if finite sets of samples from the two classes are available, then a decision function based on estimates f(x) and ĝ(x) can be used to classify future observations. In general, however, when the measurement complexity (the dimensionality N) is increased arbitrarily and the sets of training samples remain finite, a ''peaking phenomenon'' of the following kind is observed: classification accuracy improves at first, peaks at a finite value of N, called the optimum measurement complexity, and starts deteriorating thereafter. We derive, for the case of statistically independent measurements, general conditions under which it can be guaranteed that the peaking phenomenon will not occur, and the correct classification probability will keep increasing to value unity as N → ∞. Several applications are considered which together indicate, contrary to general belief, that independence of measurements alone does not guarantee the absence of the peaking phenomenon."
"In choosing the best parameters for compensation networks for systems including the human operator, the problem of nonconstant human operator parameters is encountered. In particular, some operator parameters vary in an adaptive way with plant dynamics. A satisfactory design must predict the operator's parameters for a particular system. A new technique regards the pilot as an optimal controller in one sense and the compensator as an optimal controller in another sense. The combination of man, machine, and compensator may then be represented by a dual optimization problem. To account for restricted numbers of variable parameters and unavailable states, the problem is modeled as a dual suboptimal (limited state feedback), control problem. Analytic expressions are obtained for the necessary conditions for (dual) optimality. An algorithm based on the method of successive approximations is described. This provides for rapid solution to the optimization problem. The method by which any considered design configuration can be analyzed to rapidly establish its potential with respect to 1) designers cost and 2) pilots work load is illustrated, and results are included."
"Multifunctional control of artificial limbs via electromyographic (EMG) actuation requires means for reliably recognizing or distinguishing between the various functions on the basis of the recorded EMG data. Furthermore, constraints of weight, cost, and computation time on practical prosthesis application must be satisfied. An approach to the aforementioned recognition problem is given in terms of deriving a fast parametric-recognition algorithm whereby the autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) parameters and the Kalman filter parameters of the EMG time series are identified. It is shown that the resulting identified parameters yield sufficient information to discriminate between a small number of upper extremity functions. Problems involved in practical prosthesis control via the present approach and problems of hardware realization are discussed to illustrate the validity of the approach."
"Computer-based education systems utilizing adaptive teaching strategies could benefit greatly from a knowledge of the student-user's emotional state. Comparative studies of speech analysis techniques suitable for a two-way audio communications system between student and computer led to the hypothesis that voice pitch frequency is related to emotional state. Experimental results are given based on the analysis of words spoken by drama students, which validate this hypothesis, and recommendations are made for incorporating a two-way audio component into future computer-based learning systems."
"We propose a new nonstationary random environment R(C1(t,ω),...,Cr(t,ω)), where t represents time and ω ∈ Ω, Ω being the supporting set of a probability measure space (Ω,B,μ). Moreover, the learning performance of the Lr-1 scheme under R(C1(t,ω),..., Cr(t,ω)) is discussed."
"A simple pattern discriminating system using a nerve cell model as an analog threshold device is presented, in which a voltage controlled blocking oscillator (VCBO) is used as the electronic model of a nerve cell. The system is designed to discriminate the numeral patterns (0,1,...,9). A new analog decision-making neural network is used in the final stage to discriminate the pattern, and successful experimental results are shown."
"Data on the international movement of petroleum are compiled by the United Nations. Two graphical devices are employed to facilitate an understanding of the patterns in the 1970 data. They both require the estimation of an origin-destination independence model of flows. Residuals from the model are examined, and results interpreted."

"The set of five papers included in this Transactions originally were presented at the Workshop on the Economies of Scale in Today's Communications Systems (held in Washington, DC, USA, on September 13, 1973) was motivated by the need for knowledge to be applied to a variety of public policy questions which are now facing decision makers. This is the first time that this subject has been discussed in a public forum at this depth and breadth. The papers were planned to explore the present ·state of knowledge of the economies of scale and closely related subjects in telecommunications economics and to add to this knowledge or at least to guide in the search for it. Since this set of papers do represent a first we make no apologies about the obvious gaps that we find existing in our state of knowledge, since we feel it fairly represents reality. It is hoped, however, that the set of papers will be useful both to policy makers and to policy researchers who must make decisions with the existing state of knowledge. Because policy issues are almost, by definition, controversial, the editor has sought to secure a balance in several ways to avoid undue bias and to provide writers of diverse backgrounds and points of view. There is a balance in the papers between economic theory and practice. There is also a balance between the statistical and the analytical approach to the design of production cost functions. There is also a balance among interest groups: the university, the independent consulting firm, the government, the new specialized common carriers, and the existing common carriers; all are represented, and have been invited to present their own viewpoints, as well as to make their contributions to knowledge."
"This paper defines ``economies of scale'' and its measure, together with related cost concepts, including first, annual, equated, and long-range incremental costs. New partial first cost functions are suggested for subscriber loops, switching, transmission, and multiplex systems, and how these may be fitted together to acquire perspective at the system level is discussed."
"Notions of economies of scale have always played a unique role in public policy formation, although most often implicity rather than explicitly. It is the cornerstone of the theory of natural monopoly and provides the primary justification for direct government regulation of telecommunications common carriers. The relations between the technical economic concept of economies of scale and current public policy issues in telecommunications are examined. The relationship between economies of scale and the traditional approach to regulation as a basis for understanding current policy conflicts between federal and state regulators is discussed. The theoretical economic concept of economies of scale, in contrast to concepts of short-run capacity utilization, economies of specialization, and economies of technological change is developed. The importance of time, uncertainty, and market characteristics in the measurement of scale effects is emphasized. Finally, the implications of economies of scale for current public policy issues in telecommunications such as the role of competition, cream skimming, and discriminatory rate reductions in response to competition are addressed."
"By estimating production functions from statistical data on the telephone industry, it is possible to calculate coefficients that indicate probable levels of returns to scale. Two different production functions are employed, later suitably modified to take account of technological change, and input requirements functions are calculated. An attempt is made to describe average cost curves. The regressions are based on FCC data for the Bell System and the United States Independent Telephone Association (USITA) data for independents. The investigation concludes that what appear to have been important and increasing returns to scale in the Bell System over the period 1946-1970, were largely the result of technological improvement. The vast differences in average plant and value-added size between Bell operating companies and USITA companies are not reflected in comparable differences in returns to scale."
"A foundation for examining network economy of scale effects is presented. A natural measure of the network scale effect is the network cost elasticity e, defined as the ratio of the fractional decrease in network average cost per circuit mile to the fractional increase in total circuit miles carried by the network. The maximum scale effect is given by e = 1 while e = 0 signifies no scale effect. The value of e can be estimated by comparing two network plans, one with nominal circuit demands and one with small variations in the demands. For a static network model, e can vary from 0 to 0.75 for several possible ways of changing each point-to-point circuit demand. The complex point-to-point nature of network demand must be included in any meaningful study of network scale effects. A simple example is used to show that static studies, while providing useful insight, have little relevance to issues concerned with a communications network evolving over time. A dynamic model of network evolution is presented which includes the point-to-point nature of demand and the sequential nature of facility installation decisions. A low-cost plan is developed for a nominal and slightly modified demand forecast. The transmission facilities assumed available are the same for both plans. However, advances in transmission technology during the study interval must be allowed in both plans if the results are to have relevance."
"The entities providing value-added network (VAN) service make the implicit assumption that by leasing private lines from the telephone carriers, they can make more efficient use of the lines than can the telephone carriers. If this is proven true, the VAN's should have scale economies at network sizes much smaller than the telephone network, while achieving other desirable technical and economic properties. Why the VAN carriers think this assumption is true is explained."
"Behavioral factors in the economies of providing communications services are known to be very important, but they are essentially unquantified. What is known about some of the factors and relationships among them that do affect the economies of scale, particularly in the area of employee motivation, is reviewed."
"Two approaches to an identification problem in hydrology are presented, based upon concepts from modern control and estimation theory. The first approach treats the identification of unknown parameters in a hydrologic system subject to noisy inputs as an adaptive linear stochastic control problem; the second approach alters the model equation to account for the random part in the inputs, and then uses a nonlinear estimation scheme to estimate the unknown parameters. Both approaches use state-space concepts. The identification schemes are sequential and adaptive and can handle either time-invariant or time-dependent parameters. They are used to identify parameters in the Prasad model of rainfall-runoff. The results obtained are encouraging and confirm the results from two previous studies; the first using numerical integration of the model equation along with a trial-and-error procedure, and the second using a quasi-linearization technique. The proposed approaches offer a systematic way of analyzing the rainfall-runoff process when the input data are imbedded in noise."
"Supply and demand models are developed as aids in planning future water resource expenditures. The supply model yields least-cost schedules of projects to meet assumed levels of demand. The demand model, conversely, allocates available water supplies within a regional input-output economy to most efficiently utilize the available resource. As more and more water is made available at various future points in time, the extra amount will be used for less important and productive uses. However, as additional water supply is planned, the costs of supplying the resources become excessively high, since less efficient supply projects must be built. For these reasons, the supply and demand models are placed in a hierarchical framework whereby the supply/demand projections are adjusted so that the additional costs of supply match the additional economic value of the supply. This requires a formal extension of classical benefit-cost analysis, which is referred to as dynamic benefit-cost analysis."
"The specification of a performance criterion is one of the basic requirements for the formal analysis of quantitative decision processes. A procedure of quantitatively selecting the performance index for economic stabilization policy by solving the so-called inverse optimal control problem is developed. When a closed-loop system with a known control policy is given, the inverse optimal control problem is to determine performance indices for which the given control rule is optimal. A sufficient condition is developed for the solution of the inverse problem for long-run economic stabilization policy, and an explicit solution is obtained for short-run economic stabilization policy by considering a special case where the performance index does not penalize the costs of implementing control policies. The solution of the inverse problem is found to be not unique in general, which implies that the optimal control policies are fairly robust against different performance indices. Also, it is found that the solution of the inverse problem for a linear regulator holds true for the linear tracking problem, which makes the analysis much simpler. A procedure is developed for the selection of the performance index along with the optimal feedback control policy by which the economic system is to reveal the desired characteristics. The procedure demonstrates the determination of the steady states as policy goals, the computation of the feedback control policy, and the construction of a performance index, through a small econometric model."
"This paper reports a machine that is able to respond correctly to inputs having multiple meanings by grasping its situation. Unlike the conventional learning systems, the machine models the context relation between input patterns by a learning process. The machine can grasp its situation by the use of the modeled context relation, and hence it can respond correctly. To be concrete, the machine can correctly recognize patterns having multiple meanings such as 0 (``oh'' or ``zero'') as the situation may demand. The machine is composed of the backward coupling of the same kind of neuronlike elements called basic computational elements. The context relation between two input patterns is given by the coupling coefficient of the two basic computational elements correlated to the two patterns, respectively. Coupling coefficients make potentials of the elements correlated to the present inputs higher than the other elements. These higher potentials enable the machine to grasp the situation. Stability analysis is also made, and conditions for the machine to operate correctly are definitely shown under some assumptions. The machine was simulated on a computer, and several input patterns each of which had two meanings were recognized correctly."
"A great number of techniques have been applied to the general problem of adaptive control. What began as a study of engineering adaptive control problems involving dynamics, system and measurement noise, monitoring, transduction, and on-line instrumentation seems to have moved towards learning theory and methodology research that uses a refined plant/environment model as a vehicle of demonstration. An attempt is made to bring together, order, and briefly discuss many contributions in this field, bridging the era of earlier engineering practice to more recent artificial intelligence speculation. Both unimodal and multimodal strategies are discussed, together with problems arising in nonstationary environmental situations where information conservation, update, and retrieval are of considerable importance. Methods discussed include gradient, correlation, random, stochastic automata, fuzzy automata, pattern recognition, and mixed strategies. A selected reference list is provided."
"The problem of grammatical inference is introduced, and its potential engineering applications are demonstrated. Inference algorithms for finite-state and context-free grammars are presented. The application of some of the algorithms to the inference of pattern grammars in syntactic pattern recognition is illustrated by examples."
"``Integrated'' control of pest species refers to a combination of physical, chemical, and biological actions for purposes of regulation. Attempts at the theoretical optimization of pest control exist in the literature (find seven such studies cited in the reference section). These studies have been analytical studies with simplified models or have been dynamic programming studies with low-order models. In this correspondence the numerical solution of the two-point boundary value problem of the optimal control of pests is illustrated. Such procedures are often subject to convergence problems but always hold the promise of being applicable to higher order models. Linear quadratic regulation about an optimal open loop trajectory is illustrated by example. Another feature here is a description of a ``dollar cost'' performance index. The effect of increasing ``marginal'' cost of control (i.e., increase of the partial derivative of cost with respect to control) is demonstrated. One of the advantages of the numerical method utilized is that the order of the model can be increased to include a dynamic crop state. A dynamic crop state is necessary for the proper calculation of the cumulative economic damage by a pest."
"Interaction measures are presented that use the parameters of the controlled process to quantify interactions between controls and subsystems. The notions introduced include a basic measure of interaction, a measure of the ``distance'' (lack of interaction) between controls (subsystems), a measure of control (subsystem) ``leverage'' (relative importance of parameters in affecting a control or subsystem), and a measure of potential conflict between controls (subsystems). Via these interaction measures one can establish a control and subsystem interaction profile. The derived measures are only approximate measures of the interactions, but they can be refined if the description of the control-parameter relationships can be quantified more precisely."
"An experiment was designed to measure the spatial resolution of a visual prosthetic. Blind subjects were instructed to identify from tactile stimulation the orientation of grated targets of specific spatial frequencies. The bandwidth of the probability of correct detection of orientation versus the spatial frequency is taken as a measure of the system resolution. For a 20° field of view, the equivalent visual acuity of this system is 20/4820."
"A clustering and data-reorganizing algorithm based on the concept of the shortest spanning path of a graph is given. This algorithm can be used to reorganize and/or cluster a large file of data."
"A sequential nonparametric pattern classification procedure is presented. The method presented is an estimated version of the Wald sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). This method utilizes density function estimates, and the density estimate used is discussed, including a proof of convergence in probability of the estimate to the true density function. The classification procedure proposed makes use of the theory of order statistics, and estimates of the probabilities of misclassification are given. The procedure was tested on discriminating between two classes of Gaussian samples and on discriminating between two kinds of electroencephalogram (EEG) responses."
"The ``fading memory'' filter of Sorenson and the ``finite memory'' filter of Jazwinski are rigorously tied together. The resultant linear filter is shown to be sequential embodying the salient advantages of the fading and finite policies."
"In previous work the jth automaton of a system of interactive automata was treated as a black box containing a stimulus processor that received stimuli and produced responses. Here the automaton is broken down into greater structural detail, making the receptors and effectors distinguishable from the stimulus processor. The sets of stimuli and triadic responses remain observed sets over a moment base. The sets of receptors and effectors are described by dyadic relations on the sets of principal and auxiliary receptors and effectors. Modifications to the equations and functions are made, and summaries of the graph primitives for the processor, environment, and time graphs are presented reflecting these modifications. The results of this analysis has been required in the formulation of a language information theory, and the manner of importance is illustrated by an example sentence."
"Not infrequently, societal engineers are accused of neglecting human values and of proposing impractical solutions to oversimplified problems. Sometimes this criticism is invited, and perhaps justified, by a tendency to go too far, too fast, in the modeling of complex social systems. As an example, these comments consider some possible reactions to Rabow's model of criminal justice."
"Dreyfus' two major arguments against an optimistic view on artificial intelligence are: 1) failure of artificial intelligence during the period 1957-1967 to achieve the initial promises, and 2) wrong assumptions underlying the optimistic view on artificial intelligence. It is shown that neither argument is a valid one. His suggestions for alternative views are sometimes interesting, but present nothing essentially new. The reviewer agrees that there are things that the computer cannot do, but most of the author's arguments are illogical or out of place."

   "The progress achieved internationally in the field of MOS-RAM devices for EDP main memories is described in this paper. Under the continuous pressure to cut costs, storage density and capacity have been increased by a factor of 20 since 1969 so that memory technology has become the pacemaker for large scale integration. Improvements in the readout technique are discussed by taking the 4096 bit memory device Siemens S193 as an example. A more efficient peripheral circuitry, such as internal clock generation, TTL-compatible interface, dynamic address decoders and an integrated output amplifier make it easier for the user to employ these modern components. A number of unavoidable compromises in testing and encapsulation of the devices and in circuit simulation and optimization are dealt with. After a brief review of other storage principles a forecast of the development of dynamic MOS memories is given in conclusion."
        "When T.V. setmakers first started using integrated circuits in 1970 their approach was naturally cautious. One or two circuits were tried initially in small signal low voltage areas of the receiver in order to gain confidence. This start was made with the sound i.f. and signal processing (jungle) circuits. The reliability of integrated circuits as far as the setmaker was concerned was unproven and his requirement for reliability was not clearly defined. Clearly computer standards of reliability although acceptable to the customer would be too expensive for this market. Setmakers and i.c. manufacturers have learned from each other and by working together acceptable standards of performance and reliability have been established. Confidence in integrated circuits has grown so that now on average four are used in each receiver with some designs using as many as nine. The total U.K. market for linear consumer integrated circuits has grown from about one million in 1970 to twelve million in 1975. Rising labour costs in the setmaking industry has been the stimulus for the introduction of integrated circuits and they have only been accepted where there has been a cost saving to the user. In order to increase the value of integrated circuits more circuit functions have been combined and process and technology advances have enabled larger circuits to be made economically. For really low cost manufacture a large production base is required, and although initially there were numbers of customer special circuits made by i.c."
         "An attempt will be made to describe the activities that are commonly defined as Computer-Aided Design. It will cover one subject area only viz. CAD as applied in electronics. An overview will shortly elaborate the several actions that are to be carried out by designer/engineer/specialist, whether this is one person or a group of persons. The Computer-Aided Actions to aid in solving parts of the problem are described in some more detailed form. The intention of this article is to discuss the several activities started within Philips Industries, its results and several individual solutions. No attempt will be made to describe how the several parts that constitute our CAD systems work. The sole intention is to explain how CAD is defined, what aids the engineer might use, and to some extent why these were created. For a reasonable quick reference the preface that follows displays an overview of the various CAD activities, their cradle and their relations."

"Array-like structures for high-speed multiplication, division, square and square-root operations have been described in this paper. In these designs the division and square-rooting time have been made to approach to that of multiplication operation. These structures are optimum from speed and versatility point of view. Most of the cellular arrays described in the literature are adequately slow. The time delay is particularly significant in the division and square-rooting operations due to the ripple effect of the carries. Though the carry-save technique has been widely utilized for multiplication operation, it has been only recently employed by Cappa et. al. in the design of a non-restoring divider array. This requires sign-bit detection that makes the array non-uniform. Such an array has been named as an array-like structure. The carry-save method has been extended here for restoring division operation. Due to sign-detection and overflow correction requirements, the restoring method is slightly complex. But the main advantage of such restoring array is in its simple extension for multiplication operation. The array for the two operations, when pipelined, will have more computing power than all other multiplier-divider arrays. Suggestions have also been included for further speed improvement. The technique applied for division operation is as well applicable for the square-rooting and an array-like structure for square-square-rooting operations has also been given. For performing any one of the four operations, the only manipulation to be done is to combine the two arrays; one for multiplication-division and another for square-square-rooting. Possible methods of combining the two arrays have been indicated and their relative advantages and disadvantages have been mentioned. Finally, a generalized pipeline array-like structure with complete internal details and for 4-bit operation, has been shown. Due consideration has also been given to the possibility of large-scale-integration of different arrays presented in this paper."
"Developments Reported Prior to 1972. This paper reviews work related to the theory and application of higher-radix, non-restoring division as originally defined by Robertson in 1958 [1]. The class of division methods proposed by Robertson is described by the recursive relationship:"
"Introduction Recent research has led to the derivation of bounds for the time required to perform arithmetic operations by means of logical elements with a limited number of inputs [1]–[4]. The model of a (d, r) logical circuit C employed in these studies consists of a set of (d, r) logical elements and a rule of interconnection with designated sets of input and output lines. The (d, r) logical element has r input lines and one output line; these lines can assume one of d distinct states. The (d, r) logical element has a unit time delay; that is, the state of the output line at the time t+1 is a function of the states of the input lines at time t."
"This paper is concerned with the algebraic sign detection of a number in a residue number system. The proposed solution is applicable only to nonredundant systems. The method utilizes a systematic decomposition of the sign function S that is based on some special properties of S. Starting with the canonical sum-of-products expression for S, we transform the expression to a form whose realization is simpler than the canonical form realization and, if possible, also simpler than the minimal sum-of-products realization. In some cases, the proposed method yields savings as high as 85% compared to the minimal sum-of-products realization for S."
"Static binary to BCD conversion has been des-scribed in many papers during the last decade, but none of the methods presented were practical for the conversion of large number of binary bits."
"The methods of significance arithmetic are applied to the numerical solution of a nonlinear partial differential equation. Our approach permits the use of initial values having imprecision considerably greater than that of rounding error; moreover, the intermediate and final quantities are monitored so that at any stage the precision of such quantities is available. An algorithm is found that represents faithfully the solution to a difference equation approximation to Burgers' equation."
"Algorithms are given which compute multiple sums and products and arbitray roots of floating-point numbers with maximum accuracy. The summation algorithm can be applied to compute scalar products, matrix products, etc. For all these functions, simple error formulas and the smallest floating-point intervals containing the exact result can be obtained."
"Mirror coding for signed numbers is defined \"by means pf a set of primitive powers of two {+2n, −2n−1, …−2°} where signs of the usual set used in 2's complement representation are reversed. Use of the mirror representation is shown as an alternate design approach and is illustrated \"by a special purpose adder design in mirror code, by an alternate proof of a basic property of sign-ed-digit arithmetic and as another interpretation of cells used in some array multipliers for signed numbers. Lastly, the concept is used to define a variable mode redundant coding, allowing simple sign-flipping without overflow."
"The design of modulo 2k + 1 adders for arbitrary k is considered, with the objective of achieving a logic structure as regular as possible so as to allow a convenient implementation in large-scale integration technology (LSI). It is shown how the design problem can be reduced to the recursive generation of a subtract signal and to the merging, in various degrees, of the corresponding logic with the logic of an ordinary adder or, alternately, of a so-called signed-carry adder which is defined and designed itself in general, with both recursive and explicit carry schemes. Modulo 2k + 1 adder designs are given, one with conventional adder, another based on signed-carry adder and a third, derived from the signed-carry scheme, where subtract signal generation and carry logic are merged. This last scheme can be set up with two backward recursion chains and five or six forward ones. Two more basic variants are finally indicated for this integrated scheme, aiming at reducing as much as possible the residual logic structure irregularity presented by the most significant position in the word"
"There seems to be a tug-of-war raging between computer procurement technical evaluation committees, computer designers and scholars of computer science and numerical analysis over the issue of parallelism in computations. Caught in the middle seems to be the user community and the compiler writers. For the scope of this paper, the term \"user community\" will be assumed to be Fortran programmers who are involved in solving problems that require large computer resources, e.g. plasma research, weather prediction, ray tracing, seismic analysis, econometric modeling, weapons research, reactor calculation, etc."

"This paper presents a recently discovered general computational method, amenable for efficient implementation in digital computing systems. The method provides a unique, simple and fast algorithm for solving many computational problems, such as the evaluation of polynomials, rational functions and arithmetic expressions, or solving a class of systems of linear equations, or performing the basic arithmetics. In particular, the method, is well suited for fast evaluation of commonly used, mathematical functions."

"Recently, while considering the connection of a 48 bit word computer to a 16 bit computer, we felt the need for a fast and inexpensive device that would multiply a binary address by a factor of three. Since 3N = N + 2N, there is an obvious solution of providing a normal adder circuit and presenting one set of inputs with N and the other with N-shifted left one place. But, there is a great deal of redundancy here since knowing one input we have complete knowledge of the other."
"A new system of numerals is introduced for representing numbers in base 2N for N≤8. The new notation greatly simplifies arithmetical operations on numbers. For examples for, N=3(4) one obtains a notation for octal (hexadecimal) numbers in which one can perform addition and multiplication much more easily than in the standard notation. For N=8 one obtains a practical way of representing numbers to the base 256. A simplification of the decimal notation is also presented."
"An important aspect of any evaluative procedure for developing high quality mathematical software is testing the effects of arithmetic behavior on algorithmic implementations. This paper describes a proposed design approach and various applications of a high-level language floating-point simulator which has two inputs: the program to be tested and a description of the floating-point arithmetic under which the routine is to be executed. A brief discussion of the motivation for this approach is given along with a review of existing efforts to study the influences of computer arithmetic on the accuracy and reliability of mathematical software. An overview of the simulator's structure is presented as well as suggestions for experiments to assist in determining the effects of floatingpoint behavior across several different computer architectures. Present and future uses of the simulator are also indicated."
"This paper describes the arithmetic and logic design of the digit processing logic of an arithmetic element. The arithmetic element is used in an iterative structure and arithmetic processing takes place serially on a digit by digit basis with the most significant digit first. Starting from the arithmetic specification of the digit processing logic, the arithmetic design (namely, the choice of number system, number representation and the digit algorithm) is developed. Algebraic and logic designs of the logic necessary to execute the digit algorithm and its implication for LSI implementation are discussed."
"We are concerned in this paper with the representation of an integer in a (multiple-modulus) residue number system and, in particular, with an algorithm for changing the base vector of the residue number system. Szabo and Tanaka [1, p.47] describe such an algorithm when each modulus of the second base vector is relatively prime to each modulus of the first base vector. However, we show that a much simpler algorithm exists if we allow the moduli of the second base vector to have factors in common with the moduli of the first base vector (even though the moduli of the second base vector are pairwise relatively prime among themselves). Since the algorithm involves the use of \"associated\" residue and mixed-radix representations for integers, Section 2 contains an elementary survey of the terminology, notation, and theory behind these two types of representation. Section 3 contains the proofs of the basic theorems upon which our algorithm for residue base conversion is based along with a description of the algorithm. It also contains illustrative examples which demonstrate the power of the algorithm. In this paper we lay the foundation for a subsequent paper in which we propose procedures for extending single-precision residue arithmetic to multiple-precision residue arithmetic."
"Except for a few notable examples, all computers have been designed as \"adder-central\" architectures. \"Adder-central,\" as used here, refers to an organization which places the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) at that junction of the system through which all data must flow — thus creating a bottleneck. In the early days, when adders were expensive, cost considerations precluded more than one ALU. Nowadays powerful ALU's are available at very low cost and a designer, even of minicomputers, can consider placing more than one ALU in a system."
"The author suggests that every computer with floating-point addition and subtraction should have PSW control able roundoff facilities. Yohe's catalog should be included. There should also be a stable roundoff mode using the round-to-off or round-to-even rule based on whether the radix is divisible by four or only by two."
"A compatible number system for mixed fixed-point and floating-point arithmetic is described in terms of number formats and opcode sequences (for hardwired or microcoded control). This inexpensive system can be as fast as fixed-point arithmetic on integers, is faster than normalized arithmetic in floating point, gets answers identical to those of normalized arithmetic, and automatically satisfies the Algol-60 mixed-mode rules. The central concept is the avoidance of meaningless \"normalization\" following arithmetic operations. Adoption of this system could lead to simpler compilers."
"In this paper the definition of comparison sets and a discussion of their usefulness are presented based on the research work reported in (14). In addition some new results concerning the distribution of floating point (FLP) operand pairs over comparison sets are given."
"In ordered sets it is possible to show under certain assumptions two basic theorems concerning the cycle length of sequences of iterates generated by monotone operators. These results are applied to different iterative methods, where the conclusions are valid for the sequences of iterates produced by the numerical computations only, if the used computer arithmetic is properly implemented."
"It is proposed to substitute the standard data type real of a high level language, with a unified data representation which can include a variety of interpretations as well as formats, in order to allow experiments with an environment containing a spectrum of non-standard arithmetics, as well as standard. The implementation of a system is described where syntatic extensions to a language are made to support a microprogrammed virtual arithmetic unit which can treat variants such as integers, normalized, and unnormalized floating point numbers and intervals, within a unified representation.∗∗ More specifically Pascal is chosen as the base language, because it allows the user to define new data types, and the extension then mainly consists in substituting the simple (unstructured) data type real with a skeletal structured type (which will be called numeric). The system is intended to be implemented on a microprogrammable processor (called MATHILDA) with a 64 bit wide datapath. The language Pascal has already been partially implemented based on a stack machine specifically designed for that language, and realized by interpretation in microcode. The present compiler was constructed with the aid of a parser-generator system, which will allow the language extensions to be made with a moderate effort."
"A unique code (called Hensel's code) is derived for a rational number, by truncating its infinite padic expansion. The four basic arithmetic algorithms for these codes are described and their application to rational matrix computations is demonstrated by solving a system of linear equations exactly, using the Gaussian elimination procedure. A comparative study of the computational complexity involved in this arithmetic and the multiple prime module arithmetic is made with reference to matrix computations. On this basis, a multiple padic scheme is suggested for the design of a highly parallel matrix processor."
"ROM-rounding is introduced and is shown to compare favorably with existing floating-point rounding methods on design considerations and on performance over a series of error tests. The error-retarding value of guard digits, of rounding the aligned operand, and of rounding in general are discussed."
"During the last years a number of papers concerning a mathematical foundation of computer arithmetic have been written. Some of these papers are still unpublished. The papers consider the spaces which occur in numerical computations on computers in dependence of a properly defined computer arithmetic. The following treatment gives a summary of the main ideas of these papers. Many of the proofs had to be sketched or completely omitted. In such cases the full information can be found in the references."
"This paper presents results which stem from a research effort concerned with the specification and design of arithmetic units which can execute nonstandard integer and floating-point arithmetic. An arithmetic unit is proposed whose characteristics are based on user specifications and subsequently is termed a Polymorphic Arithmetic Unit (PAU). The user binds the identity of the PAU by specifying the contents of various descriptors and semantic interpretation tables which the PAU accesses during its execution. This capability removes several of the restrictions found in commercially available arithmetic units and potentially assists in mak-ink mathematically software portable."
"A very simple analog to digital converter and digital to analog converter is described for residue number digital processing. These simple devices make it feasible to replace analog components with comparitively inexpensive digital processors that use residue, or modulus, arithmetic capable of operating at very high speeds. Using off-the-shelf integrated circuits, addition, subtraction or multiplication of about 15 bits of accuracy can easily be done in as little as fifty nanoseconds. Any function using these operations (polynomial expansions, linear filters, fast fourier transforms) can be economically implemented in a pipeline or other structure to get very fast systems. Moreover, a stage in the pipeline can correct for non-linearities in the A/D or D/A converters. The simple devices described herein make residue arithmetic digital processors extremely attractive for use in fast analog systems."
"A finite precision rational number system provides for representation of a collection of rational numbers subject to limitations on numerator and denominator magnitude. In fixed-point and floatingpoint radix number systems only rationals of the form i/βj, where β is the base, can be realized. In contrast, a finite precision rational number system will allow representation of practically all simple fractions encountered in applications. In this preliminary report we first propose two types of finite precision rational number systems which we term fixed-slash and floating-slash systems [2]. We then consider the conversion (rounding) problem, that is, the determination of a number satisfying the numerator and denominator constraints approximating a given non representable real value. We show that the rounding problem is solvable by an efficient procedure, which we term mediant conversion, that derives from the theory of continued fractions."
"This paper presents a new method to study arithmetic combinatorial circuits. Using polynomial associated to the input-output sequences and to the systems it is possible to solve the problem of minimization of the number of the component blocks. Particularly, the important case of the multiple outputs elementary units can be treated. Applications of the introduced procedures to multiplier and to fast networks for performing convolution are presented."
"A companion paper entitled, \"A Unified Numeric Data Type in Pascal\", proposes the substitution of the standard data type real of the language Pascal with a unified data representation termed numeric. The numeric data type can represent a variety of arithmetic operands such as integers, normalized floating point numbers, and centered-radius intervals. This paper describes an arithmetic unit which is capable of executing the standard arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on pairs of operands specified to be of the numeric data type. This arithmetic unit, called the UNRAU — Unified Numeric Representation Arithmetic Unit, supports operations on operands externally represented as 5-tuples (t, a, e, f, r). The UNRAU provides for automatic conversion among the various data types and can also be used to perform an explicit conversion on a single operand. It is intended to implement the UNRAU on a dynamically microprogrammable microprocessor to determine what host facilities are required to efficiently realize such an arithmetic unit and to experiment with the high level language support of such a unit."
"This bibliography on computer arithmetic uses, by and large, the format and abbreviations employed by Computing Reviews. It is presented in alphabetical order only and not by individual topics. The topics included, however, span the abstract and implementation problems associated with finite precision computer arithmetics."
"Introduction Many scientific applications today require computers which are very fast and capable of processing large amounts of data. Some advances in scientific processing have been slowed due to the lack of supercomputer capabilities which are required primarily in the area of Central Processor speed and the availability of large amounts of high speed memory. Particularly in the fields of modeling and simulation, additional speed and memory capacity are desired to allow increased resolution of the experiment. Technological developments in such things as integrated circuits, multilayer printed circuit boards, memory speeds, and others have contributed to the ability of computer manufacturers to serve this market. In addition to these developments, however, large advances had to be realized from the standpoint of the basic computer architecture. The concept of pipelining has provided an answer to the large data execution rate required. Pipelined capabilities in the form of arithmetic units and special purpose functional units are included in machines such as the CEC7600, IBM 360/195, CDC STAR-100, etc.1,2 The Texas Instruments Advanced Scientific Computer (ASC) uses the pipeline concept throughout the Central Processor and carries the concept throughout the Central Processor and carries the concept further to include vector instructions in response to the high execution rates required.3"
"Since the floating-point operations form the \"basic steps in our programs, the programmer has to understand the results that — will be produced by these operations. This paper discusses operations which have been or might be implemented in the hardware. The emphasis is on making the results easy for the user to understand."
"The testing of LSI chips is expensive and unsatisfactory. On the other hand there are cases (as in space ship computers) where a damaged chip must be localized and replaced. The use of self-checking chips seems to be one of several possible solutions of this problem. The theory of the structure of self-checking logical circuit is covered by literature at least at the fundamental form (see References). However, even when the design principles are supposed to be known, their application to the actual creation of a self-checking circuit of an average complexity is and will remain an art. The reason is quite simple and fundamental: optimization of design criteria (engineering qualifications, performance and physical properties of components of the circuits are entities possessing different physical dimensions — it is impossible to qualify, for instance, two circuits A, B designed for the same task by comparing their speeds and costs if A is faster than B but B is cheaper than A) will never be objective and independent of the talent or whim of the circuit designer. As an example of the design of a self-checking circuit we present here a binary adder (Full Adder) designed under the following considerations: 1: The adder is composed from gates (AND, 0R, NAND, N0R, …). 2: Two level design was chosen. 3. Ripple carry addition was accepted as sufficient simplification for the design experiment. 4. Only two classes of fault were considered: Stuck at ONE, Stuck at ZERO. 5. Any single fault in the circuit must be signalized either during the activity of the circuit (clock ON) or during a test fault injection (clock OFF). 6. The number of cases where a multiple fault remains undetected must be extremely low in comparison with all possible cases. To obtain an adder with all those requirements the following design idea is used: The adder's three bit input (X, Y, C) is transformed into an eight bit signal (S1, i = 0, 1, …, 7) by using ONE FROM EIGHT CODE. This signal, produced by the first level of the circuit, is then transformed by the second level of the circuit into the desired output signal (Z, G) by using four wires and TWO FROM FOUR CODE. Ten fault signals (Fig. 1) are derived from those two codes and checked at the proper state of the clock."
"Recently, there has been some interest in the use of continued fractions for digital hardware calculations. We require that the coefficients of the continued fractions be integral powers of two. As a result well known continued fraction expansions of functions cannot be used. Methods of expansion of a large number of functions are presented. We show that the problem of selection of coeffiients of the continued fractions does not have practical solution in most of the cases we have considered. We conjecture that the solution of a polynomial equation is the only problem that can be solved in our formulation."
"In this paper we are considering problems of division and multiplication in a computational environment in which all basic arithmetic algorithms satisfy \"on-line\" property: to generate jth digit of the result it is necessary and sufficient to have argument(s) available up to the (j+δ)th digit, where the index difference 6 is a small positive constant. Such an environment, due to its potential to perform a sequence of operations in an overlapped fashion, could conveniently speed up an arithmetic multiprocessor structure or it could be useful in certain real-time applications, with inherent on-line properties. The on-line property implies a left-to-right digit-by-digit type of algorithm and consequently, a redundant representation, at least, of the results. For addition and subtraction such algorithms, satisfying on-line property, can be easily specified. Multiplication requires a somewhat more elaborate approach and there are several possible ways of defining an on-line algorithm. However, the existence of an on-line division algorithm is not obvious and its analysis appears interesting."
"A common requirement accompanying high-speed parallel addition is the early detection that the sum is equal to zero. Normally, this condition is detected from the sum, generally at least two logic gate levels after the sum."

 "Discusses the importance of formal specifications and surveys a number of promising specification techniques. The role of formal specifications both in proofs of program correctness and in programming methodologies leading to programs which are correct by construction, is explained. Some criteria are established for evaluating the practical potential of specification techniques. The importance of providing specifications at the right level of abstraction is discussed, and a particularly interesting class of specification techniques, those used to construct specifications of data abstractions, is identified. A number of specification techniques for describing data abstractions are surveyed and evaluated with respect to the criteria."
"Wirth (1971) has proposed a method of `stepwise refinement' for writing computer programs. This paper proposes that the steps be expressed as proofs. A program for the eight queens problem is developed, and the proof method is applied across two of the steps of the development. The strengths and weaknesses of the method, and its implications for the programming process and programming language design are discussed."
"The Planner Project is constructing a programming apprentice to assist in knowledge based programming. The programming apprentice is designed for interactive use by expert programmers in the meta-evaluation of implementations in the context of their contracts and background knowledge. Meta-evaluation produces a justification which makes explicit exactly how the module depends on the contracts of other modules and on the background knowledge. The justification is used in answering questions on the behavioral dependencies between modules and in analyzing the implications of perturbations in specifications and/or implementation."
"In the past few years, research has been actively carried out in an attempt to improve the quality and reliability of large-scale software systems. Although progress has been made on the formal proof of program correctness, proving large-scale software systems correct by formal proof is still many years away. Automated software tools have been found to be valuable in improving software reliability and attacking the high cost of software systems. This paper attempts to describe some main features of automated software tools and some software evaluation systems that are currently available."
"This paper is an initial progress report on the development of an interactive system for verifying that computer programs meet given formal specifications. The system is based on the conventional inductive assertion method: given a program and its specifications, the object is to generate the verification conditions, simplify them, and prove what remains. The important feature of the system is that the human user has the opportunity and obligation to help actively in the simplifying and proving. A general description is given of the overall design philosophy, structure, and functional components of the system, and a simple sorting program is used to illustrate both the behavior of major system components and the type of user interaction the system provides."
"Describes a prototype system Vista which provides assistance in synthesizing correct inductive assertions. Given only the source program, it is able to generate a useful class of assertions automatically. For a larger class, it is able to extend partial inductive assertions supplied by the programmer to form complete assertions from which it proves program correctness. Its synthesis methods include: symbolic evaluation in a weak interpretation, combining output assertions with loop exit information to obtain trail loop assertions, and extracting information from proofs which fail in order to determine how assertions should be strengthened."
"Given a `DO WHILE' program P and a function F on a domain D, the authors investigate the problem of proving (or disproving) if P computes F over D. It is shown that if P satisfies certain natural constraints (well behaved), then there is a loop assertion independent of the structure of the loop body, that is both necessary and sufficient for proving the hypothesis. These results are extended to classes of loop programs which are not well behaved and to FOR loops. The sufficiency of Hoare's DO WHILE axiom for well-behaved loop programs is shown. Applications of these ideas to the problem of mechanical generation of assertions is discussed."
"A graph theoretic model for software systems is presented which permits a system to be characterized by its set of allowable execution sequences. It is shown how a system can be structured so that every execution sequence affected by a control fault is obviously in error, i.e., not in the allowable set defined by the system model. Faults are detected by monitoring the execution sequence of every transaction processed by the system and comparing its execution sequence to the set of allowable sequences. Algorithms are presented both for structuring a system so that all faults can be detected and for fault detection concurrent with system operation. Simulation results are presented which support the theoretical development of this paper."
"Rollback and recovery (RR) is a method of enchancing the reliability of file or data base systems. At certain points in time, called checkpoints, a copy of the data or files is made on tape (or other storage devices). A chronological record is kept of all transactions which modify the data stored by the system; this record is called the audit trail. When an error is detected, the copy of the files or data made at the most recent checkpoint is loaded, and all transactions on the audit trail since this check point are reprocessed in chronological sequence, thus recovering from the error. This paper presents models and techniques which aid in determining optimal times for checkpoints."
"Describes the design of a programming language suitable for writing portable, machine independent programs. Based on Fortran, and implemented at the lowest level by means of subprograms, this language (PFortran) provides features which allow programs to be designed so as to be rather insensitive to computer architecture (byte versus word addressable) or to main memory size."
"Summarizes some recent experience in analyzing and eliminating sources of error in the design phase of large software projects. It points out some of the significant differences in software error incidence between large and small software projects. A taxonomy of software error causes, and some analyses of the design error data performed to obtain a better understanding of the nature of large-scale software design errors and to evaluate alternative methods of preventing, detecting, and eliminating them are presented. Based on this analysis of observational data, a hypothesis was derived regarding the potential cost effectiveness of an automated aid to detecting inconsistencies between assertions about the nature of inputs and outputs of the various elements of the software design."

  "Program errors detected during internal testing of the operating system DOS/VS form the basis for an investigation of error distributions in system programs. Using a classification of the errors according to various attributes, conclusions can be drawn concerning the possible causes of these errors. The information thus obtained is applied in a discussion of the most effective methods for the detection and prevention of errors."
"Discusses the need for quantitative descriptions of software errors and methods for gathering such data. The software development cycle is reviewed, and the frequency of the errors that are detected during software development and independent validation are compared. Data obtained from validation efforts are presented, indicating the number of errors in ten categories and three severity levels; the inferences that can be drawn from these data are discussed. Data describing the effectiveness of validation tools and techniques as a function of time are presented and discussed. The software validation cost is contrasted with the software development cost. The applications of better quantitative software error data are summarized."
"Examines the theoretical and practical role of testing in software development. The authors prove a fundamental theorem showing that properly structured tests are capable of demonstrating the absence of errors in a program. The theorem's proof hinges on our definition of test reliability and validity, but its practical utility hinges on being able to show when a test is actually reliable. The authors explain what makes tests unreliable (for example, they show by example why testing all program statements, predicates, or paths is not usually sufficient to insure test reliability), and they outline a possible approach to developing reliable tests. They also show how the analysis required to define reliable tests can help in checking a program's design and specifications as well as in preventing and detecting implementation errors."
"Much of the software developed to support engineering design calculations is produced by persons whose primary skill is not that of computer scientist. Software validation techniques suitable for use by these engineer-programmers have been under investigation by the Navy as part of a project designed to increase the reliability, usability, and portability of engineering design software. This paper describes the goals and results of the project and describes the software validation process which was developed. A software validation tool which was produced during the project is described and compared with several other tools. Some areas for further work are suggested."
"The language in which programs are written can have a substantial effect on their reliability. This paper discusses the design of programming languages to enhance reliability. It presents several general design principles, and then applies them to particular languages constructs. Since the validity of such design principles cannot be logically proved, empirical evidence is needed to support or discredit them. A major experiment to measure the effect of nine specific language-design decisions in one context has been performed. Analysis of the frequency and persistence of errors shows that several decisions had a significant impact on reliability."
"The programming language Pascal is assessed in the light of `reliable programming' and with the background of five years of experience with the language. Some features are selected to point out remaining problems, either inherent or specific, from which some guidelines for the design of choice of languages for reliable programming are derived. Among the discussed features are the concept of data type, the sequential file structure and the type union."
"Describes a new programming language for structured programming of computer operating systems. It extends the sequential programming language Pascal with concurrent programming tools called processes and monitors. Section I explains these concepts informally by means of pictures illustrating a hierarchical design of a simple spooling system. Section II uses the same example to introduce the language notation. The main contribution of Concurrent Pascal is to extend the monitor concept with an explicit hierarchy of access rights to shared data structures that can be stated in the program text and checked by a compiler."
"The cost of a change to a large software system is often primarily a function of the size of the system rather than the complexity of the change. One reason for this is that programs which access some given data structure must operate on it using notations which are determined by its exact representation. Thus, changing how it is implemented may necessitate changes to the programs which access it. This paper develops a programming language notation and semantic interpretations which allow a program to operate on a data object in a manner which is dependent only on its logical or abstract properties and independent of its underlying concrete representation."
"Presents and discusses the rationale behind a method for structuring complex computing systems by the use of what is termed `recovery blocks,' `conversations,' and `fault-tolerant interfaces.' The aim is to facilitate the provision of dependable error detection and recovery facilities which can cope with errors caused by residual design inadequacies, particularly in the system software, rather than merely the occasional malfunctioning of hardware components."
"Deals with the problem of reliability in a hardware/software system. More specifically it deals with the strategy used to achieve reliability in a particular hardware/software system built by the author and his colleagues. Rather than dealing with the myriad details of the reliability aspects of this system, the paper focuses on the design philosophy which aims at keeping the system operational even though the underlying hardware may be malfunctioning. This philosophy is essentially an extension of the `modular' programming methodology to include dynamic error detection and recovery."
"Discusses how structured programming methodology has been introduced into a large production programming organization using an integrated but flexible approach. It next analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of each component of the methodology and presents some quantitative results on its use. It concludes with recommendations based on this generally successful experience, which could be useful to other organizations interested in improving reliability and productivity."
"The Chi/OS operating system, the latest large-scale software effort of Chi Corporation, has had an excellent reliability record since its installation in November 1973. Although the system design is vital to the reliability of Chi/OS, several environmental factors are equally vital. After a brief presentation of the substantial work load supported by Chi/OS, this paper deals with those environmental factors which contribute to the reliability of the software."

 "The paper presents a methodology for software engineering. This methodology recognizes the existence of two separate and distinctive phases (architecture and implementation) of a software engineering task. These two phases are interfaced by a formalized but descriptive design specification described by a language called ADL (architectural design language). This ADL description would serve a similar purpose as that served by the blueprint. Implementation can then be accomplished from the `software blueprint' in any of three possibilities: software, hardware, or microwave. Design of a lexical scanner is chosen as an example to illustrate this methodology."
"To carry out significant program optimization, it is necessary to know what properties hold at each program unit. Frequently the properties of interest form a partially ordered set with a minimum condition (i.e., well-founded). When this occurs, it is possible to directly compute the properties that can be attached to program units and, optionally, to expand the program text to obtain a strong assignment of properties. Techniques are presented for property computation in iterative and recursive programs. Application to a variety of property sets is discussed."
"Program graphs have been used as a vehicle to focus attention on the structure of a program. A systematic methodology for partitioning a program graph (digraph) to highlight the relationships between program elements is introduced along with an attendant notation. This notation is described in purely mathematical terms in the first section, and then the programming-related implications of this approach are addressed in the second section."
"The average number of levels that a new element moves up when inserted into a heap is investigated. Two probabilistic models under which such an average might be computed are proposed. A `Lemma of Conservation of Ignorance' is formulated and used in the derivation of an exact formula for the average in one of these models. It is shown that this average is bounded by a constant and its asymptotic behaviour is discussed. Numerical data for the second model are also provided and analyzed."
"In order to help satisfy an apparent need for tools for monitoring the activities of a computer network, a system of special hardware and software, called a Computer Network Monitoring System (CNMS) is being implemented in the University of Waterloo Computer Communications Networks Group (CCNG). The paper discusses the motivation and derivation of the CNMS, then provides functional descriptions of most of the major hardware and software components, illustrates use of the CNMS, and lists experiments and applications. The CNMS consists of: 1) a set of hybrid monitors, each of which is controlled by a locally or remotely located computer; 2) monitor control and data analysis software; 3) a network traffic generator; 4) measurement software in each computer monitored. Each computer to be monitored is attached to a monitor. Telephone lines, possibly different from those of the network, connect the monitors to the controlling computer."
"The theory permits the estimation, in advance of a project, of the amount of testing in terms of execution time required to achieve a specified reliability goal [stated as a mean time to failure (MTTF)]. Execution time can then be related to calendar time, permitting a schedule to be developed. Estimates of execution time and calendar time remaining until the reliability goal is attained can be continually remade as testing proceeds, based only on the length of the execution time intervals between failures. The current MTTF and the number of errors remaining can also be estimated. Maximum likelihood estimation is employed, and confidence intervals are also established. The foregoing information is obviously very valuable in scheduling and monitoring the progress of program testing. A program has been implemented to compute the foregoing quantities. The reliability model that has been developed can be used in making system tradeoffs involving software or software and hardware components. It also provides a soundly based unit of measure for the comparative evaluation of various programming techniques that are expected to enhance reliability. The model has been applied to four medium-sized software development projects, all of which have completed their life cycles."
"It is shown how the Lisp iterative primitives PROG, SETQ, GO, and RETURN may be introduced into the Boyer-Moore method for automatically verifying Pure Lisp programs. This is done by extending some of the previously described heuristics for dealing with recursive functions. The resulting verification procedure uses structural induction to handle both recursion and iteration. The procedure does not actually distinguish between the two and they may be mixed arbitrarily. For example, since properties are stated in terms of user-defined functions, the theorem prover will prove recursively specified properties of iterative functions. Like its predecessor, the procedure does not require user-supplied inductive assertions for the iterative programs."
"The authors investigate the strong verification of programs using the concept of predicate transformer introduced by Dijkstra (1974). They show that every do-while program has a loop invariant that is both necessary and sufficient proving strong verification. This loop invariant is shown to be the least fixpoint of a recursive function mapping predicates to predicates that is defined by the program and the postcondition."

"THE TERM \"software engineering\" has a seductive turn to it and, like any seductress, can be both rewarding and dangerous. Since the NATO conferences in 1968 and 1969 the application of engineering principles to computer program design and development has been consciously investigated and the results codified as software engineering. This process has been without question a constructive step toward bringing order from chaos and such efforts are to be applauded, encouraged, and emulated. As reports of experience with the techniques of software engineering emerge, it is becoming evident that what have heretofore been hypothetical \"good ideas\" do, in fact, work."
"This paper describes an experimental program testing facility called the interactive semantic modelling system (ISMS). The ISMS is designed to allow experimentation with a wide variety of tools for collecting, analyzing, and displaying testing information. The design methodology is applicable to procedural programming languages, and Algol 60 is being used as the vehicle for elaboration of design principles and implementation techniques. This paper discusses the ISMS design, and describes the various types of analysis and display tools being developed to facilitate program testing. The ISM Preprocessor is described, an an example is presented to illustrate the data structures utilized in the ISMS."
"This paper describes an interactive system-COLUMBUS-for the development of well-structured programs in assembly language, Cobol, and PL/I. One of the basic concepts employed is the use of Nassi/Shneiderman charts as the unique reference document. For specifying the control structures of a program, the programmer uses a set of control primitives which are common for all languages used. Data declarations and executable statements are taken from the individual language. This mixture is called the COLUMBUS source form. From this source form Nassi/Shneiderman diagrams and cross-reference matrices can be produced in a language-independent fashion; pure source for the individual languages is produced by a set of preprocessors in a language-dependent fashion. This paper illustrates the mechanisms involved by giving some small examples for the individual languages, and it also gives a brief history of the project and reports on quantitative and qualitative results obtained so far. The plans for future extensions are also explained."
"The Source Code Control System (SCCS) is a software tool designed to help programming projects control changes to source code. It provides facilities for storing, updating, and retrieving all versions of modules, for controlling updating privileges for identifying load modules by version number, and for recording who made each software change, when and where it was made, and why. This paper discusses the SCCS approach to source code control, shows how it is used and explains how it is implemented."
"The use of software engineering aids in the design of a structural finite element analysis computer program for the CDC STAR-100 computer is described. Since members of the design team came from diverse backgrounds, both the unique features of the CDC STAR computer and structural analysis concepts and computing requirements had to be understood before design began. Nested functional diagrams to aid in communication among team members were used, and a standardized specification format to describe modules designed by various members was adopted. This is a report of work in progress where use of the functional diagrams provided continuity and helped resolve some of the problems arising in this long-running part-time project."
"Diligent application of software engineering techniques has achieved outstanding programmer productivity and a high degree of software excellence in the development of the program for a large real time system simulator. Moreover these programming efficiencies were achieved in a research environment where both the software and hardware requirements were meagrely defined initially and substantially modified during the course of the project. The software development tools used include the following: 1) program generation center, 2) system design team, 3) software team 4) modular top-down programming,and 5) structured programming. Continuous visibility by technically competent management has proved to be fundamental to success."
"The STRUCT system utilizes the flexibility of a powerful graphics display system to provide a set of tools for program analysis. These tools allow the analysis of the static program structure and the dynamic execution behaviour of programs within the entire operating system user program environment of the Brown University Graphics System (BUGS). Information is collected and presented in a manner which fully exploits two aspects of this environment. First, the operating system has been developed in a well-structured hierarchical manner following principles laid down by other researchers. Second the programs under analysis have been written in a structured programming language following coding conventions which make available, at the source code level, valuable program control information. This system is currently being used to predict and analyze the performance advantages available through the migration of function between levels of software and between software and firmware within the BUGS."
"This paper recommends the iterative enhancement' technique as a practical means of using a top-down, stepwise refinement approach to software development. This technique begins with a simple initial implementation of a property chosen (skeletal) subproject which is followed by the gradual enhancement of successive implementations in order to build the full implementation. The development and quantitative analysis of a production compiler for the language SIMPL-T is used to demonstrate that the application of iterative enhancement to software development is practical and efficient, encourages the generation of an easily modifiable product, and facilities reliability."
"The process of designing and evolving a programming system cannot be characterized as either top-down or bottom-up or any other well-structured process. The results, however, is a well-structured program. Since both approaches have the same goal either approach or a combination of the two is compatible with a structured programming philosophy."
"The usefulness of software monitors in testing large programs is discussed. Several types of testing strategies based on the use of monitors are surveyed. Since there is a computational overhead involved in employing monitors, attempts are made to minimize the number of monitors employed. This optimisation problem is formulated and analyzed in graph theoretic terms. Implementation aspects are considered through both discussion and examples."
"Methods of studying programmer productivity are difficult to find. The classical methods of observation and statistical analysis are in many cases inappropriate. This paper describes a simulation approach in which programmers are considered to be individual processors. Relative group productivity is then measured based upon the productivity levels and communications relationships of the processors."
"An engineering-oriented performance model of a computation is developed by extending the concept of a computation structure to cover the performance costs appropriate to software modelling. The model allows both serial and parallel (multiprocessor) configurations,and the evaluation of both time space parameters for alternate realizations. A brief discussion on the use of the model as a mechanism to guide the performance optimisation of programs is included."
"In the author's view structured programming consists of the use of the following: structure, abstraction, and specification. The purpose of this paper is to develop formal specifications for a nontrivial program in order to facilitate a proof of correctness. It is shown how the specifications serve as an abstraction for the program. A proof of correctness then consists of merely showing that the program at each level meets its formal specifications. Under this methodology lower levels of the program can be changed without affecting higher levels."
"In the above-named paper the program in Fig. 3 should read \"then begin\" on line 7, \"bufpos := 0 end end\" on line 20, and the semicolon on line 23 should be omitted. The program as given in Table I already reflects these corrections, so no other changes to the paper are necessary. These corrections were pointed out by H. C. Lauer."

"In the previous issue, we recognized the growing interest of citizen groups in disconnecting themselves from society at large and its big systems. We noted that such groups seek self-sufficiency, or at least a degree of it, and in so doing expect to exploit “soft” technology. By soft technology is meant that which is not detrimental to the environment. In many cases, this is seen to equate with low or medium technology as opposed to high or advanced technology. In taking note of this trend, one wonders how much the individual citizen rebels at large-scale technology itself, as compared to the increasing limitations its embedment in society often places upon him as a consequence of its associated constraints. In any case, it is clear that the citizen need not be a traditional environmentalist to begin viewing the complicated environment in which he must operate (or merely survive) as unaccommodating or even hostile. He goes so far as to label that total environment “The System,” becomes frustrated when it cannot be dealt with in a satisfactory way, and often blames technology for his resulting discontent."
"Points out that all microwave ovens sold in the US must be examined for radiation leakage during manufacture to meet American Safety standards."
"Hard times have hit the power industry — and the electric utilities are having a difficult time hitting back. Evidence of this is everywhere. Consumer rates are soaring as most utilities and the public service commissions that regulate them engage in a frantic game of leapfrog — new rate-hike requests following hard on the heels of rate-increase approvals ... sometimes even before the approvals are handed down. Utility issues, once among the bluest of the blue-chip, are today often less attractive than Federal and municipal bonds. And most worrisome of all, a flood of recent utility reports detail massive curtailments of planned capital expansion: according to the most recent data gathered by the National Electric Reliability Council, Princeton, N.J., 72 000 MW have been trimmed from a total of 510 000 MW of new capacity planned in early 1974 by the U.S. utilities for the decade running through 1983."
"Attendees at the recent Sixth International Conference on Urban Transportation, held in Pittsburgh, Pa., were greeted by some unusually barbed comments regarding the state of the U.S. rail system. Speaker Milton J. Shapp, Governor of Pennsylvania (and a cofounder of Jerrold Electronics Corp.) took note of an announcement by AMTRAK, the National Railroad Passenger Corp., of the acquisition of trains capable of \"high\" 200-km/h (125-mi/h) speeds. \"In each case,\" Gov. Shapp noted dryly, \"America's federally run rail passenger service was forced to buy or lease such trains from France, because no high-speed trains are built anywhere in this country.\" To make things worse, Gov. Shapp pointed out, \"the equipment AMTRAK gets from France is neither new nor novel.\" According to the Governor, French engineers save their best trains for domestic use."
"Ferrofluids challenge the traditional discipline of electrical and electronics engineering. They combine electromagnetic phenomena with the physical and chemical phenomena of a fluid. They challenge the engineer to conceive of a material that acts as a magnetic solid at the same time it acts as a liquid."
"We engineers are inclined to try to reduce all problems to their essentials. This includes, wherever possible, putting our observations in the form of equations, inequalities, differential calculus, and sets. But will this technique work as we don our management hats? I'm inclined to think that, in some important cases, it will, and that, furthermore, it helps us to understand some normally hidden corollaries. So bear with me! You'll find no Fourier analysis, and you may question the rigorousness of my manipulations, but hang in there! We'll probe responsibility, authority, decision-making, and organization."
"The author has examined published test results of two different models of limited performance (lead-acid-battery-powered) electric automobile prototypes-a 2100-kg model and a smaller `urban' car weighing 750 kg."
"Evaluation parts of an 8-bit microcomputer, which provides 12 input-output (I/O) controller options and a full complement of memories, have recently been made available. The parallel processing system, PPS-8, can handle options that provide unlimited use in communications. The system contains a microprocessor."
"A digital-transmission multimeter is designed primarily for telephone communications applications, but can also be used for operations requiring a general-purpose multimeter. The model 430 combines the functions of a frequency counter, a noise and level test set, a capacitance bridge, and a decade box with voltmeter functions. The instrument has built-in voice and program filters."
"This 160-page catalog illustrates the basic principles of thermocouple reference junctions that make use of electrical bridges, thermoelectric refrigeration, and heated oven references. How the thermocouple junctions provide the relative temperature readout is explained. Reasons for the use of thermocouple amplifiers and high-impedance thermocouples are outlined."

"Sixty-three percent of the American public favors more nuclear power plants, Louis Harris revealed to an assemblage of journalists at the Engineers Club in New York City on August 5. The new Harris poll findings showed 19 percent opposed and 18 percent not sure. Harris himself thinks this is a clear indication of how the public would vote on issues such as those posed in the California Nuclear Initiative (Spectrum, June, p. 26), which provides for a moratorium on the construction of nuclear plants in the State of California."

"Over 25 000 members of the electronics industry are expected to attend this year's 24th annual WESCON, September 16 through 19. The four-day product exposition and professional technical program will be held under one roof: the product exposition in Brooks Hall, and the professional program in the Civic Auditorium, San Francisco, Calif. Over 300 exhibitors are expected."
"Unless prompt and effective actions are taken for the safeguarding and handling of nuclear fuels, the use of nuclear fission energy will be limited. Whereas risks associated with nuclear reactors have been quantified and put in perspective, questions remain about risks associated with the safeguarding and handling of the nuclear fuels themselves. As a result, little progress is being made in the `back end' of the fuel cycle-that which includes temporary storage of spent fuel, reprocessing of spent fuel, and waste storage and/or disposal."
"In the face of deteriorating U.S. and world economies, IEEE membership had reached an all time high of 174 670 in January 1975. Month-by-month membership figures run about 3 percent higher than in 1974. Your Board of Directors interprets this as a vote of confidence in IEEE's programs."
"In the face of the severe recession that has nearly paralyzed U.S. business for some time now — a recession that has, at the time of writing, produced a 9.2-percent unemployment rate in the U.S. — IEEE has been anxiously monitoring the employment status of its members through a variety of programs. Fearing major dislocations that could make the aerospace industry débacle of the early Seventies seem like child's play, the Institute has, among other efforts, embarked on a program of monthly postcard surveys to limited samples of the membership. So far, these surveys have indicated a rising unemployment curve (at time of writing, 3.1 percent). However, financial constraints on the Institute have prevented it from developing in these postcard surveys as highly reliable an indicator of unemployment as might have been desired. Furthermore, even if the most recent percentage is valid, it is far below the national one — and considerably less than what may have been feared by the Institute's Directors. Nevertheless, it is serious, especially to those EEs who constitute the percentage."
"Apparently minority recruitment programs aren't working when it comes to electrical and electronics engineering. Based on the excellent response (about 40 000 U.S. member respondents, or a 40-percent response) resulting from the 1975 IEEE U.S. Membership Survey, less than 4 percent of the Institute's U.S. membership would appear to be non-Caucasian and only 0.5 percent would appear to be female — this at a time when the Society of Women Engineers claims that 2 percent of all engineers are women."
"At the April meeting of the IEEE Board of Directors, a historic action was taken: by a vote of 27 for and 1 against, the Institute's Board adopted an official IEEE position on Federal support of research and development. This position paper, entitled “Science, Technology, and America's Future,” calls on the United States Government to reverse what IEEE views as an ominous trend - the continuing decline of the real value of R&D funding in the U.S. - and, to correct this dangerous fall-off, the paper recommends specific actions by the Government to maintain R&D support at 3 percent of the gross national product."
"This DIP relay, which features a thermoelectrically controlled actuator that replaces the induction coil of conventional relays, operates on either ac or dc current, is rated at 5 amperes, and has builtin time-delay capability. In the latching configuration, it remains actuated even after the current has been shut off."

 "Peer review, a subject of perennial interest to authors and editors, is once again in the headlines. This time the subject merited the interest of the U.S. Congress, which wondered if the National Science Foundation's use of the peer review process in helping award grants is fair and efficient. The premise of the Congressional look-see was that perhaps Congress itself should assume more of a role in the review process. Underlying the probe was the feeling that the peer review process is not perfect, that reviewers can be biased, that they may be in conflict of interest, or that they may misuse their anonymity. While all of these suppositions may, on occasion, be true, no one has yet proposed a clearly superior system. Harold Davis, editor of Physics Today, in commenting on the Congressional probe, puts the onus on the agency program officers to deal with the hazards of conflict and bias that may occasionally arise — a delegation of responsibility with which we must agree. (There is a clear parallel between refereeing papers and awarding grants — in neither case does the final decision rest with the reviewers.)"

"Electronic controls are designed to activate injectors, air valves, and fuel pump to improve engine performance."
"The present crop of new power semiconductor devices is characterised by high switching speeds, higher voltage and current ratings, greater reliability and lower prices than its predecessor. Today's multikiloampere and -kilovolt silicon-controlled rectifiers (SRCs) with switching speeds of many kilohertz are a far cry from the first ones invented back in 1957. They are the end product of two decades of a quiet evolution in power semiconductors that has vastly improved not only SCRs but other thyristors, such as triacs, as well as rectifiers and power transistors. As a result, applications for power semiconductor devices are growing rapidly."

"Even today, antitechnology enthusiasts drive their air-poluting vehicles to convocations where they decry the very acts they themselves perform. They burn the midnight oil while suggesting that citizens grind their own coffee beans by hand - by legal edict if they will not comply voluntarily. Exaggerated? Of course. Yet a breed of environmentalist exists that is readily visualized through such a caricature."
"I first met Russell Varian in 1939 on a stairway landing in the Stanford University Physics Building. I had just been hired as a part-time research associate on the new Klystron Project at a then munificent $90 per month, and was going upstairs to meet the Varians and their small staff. I had heard of the invention of this new electron tube that could generate centimeter waves, but I did not know how it worked, and indeed I had never even seen one. Thus, when I stopped and introduced myself to Russ, he thought the first order of business ought to be an explanation of the principle of the klystron. I remember his saying something like this:"
"Only five years ago, few visible light-emittng-diode (LED) devices were used as instrument displays, and liquid-crystal displays were largely a laboratory curiosity. Gas-discharge, fluorescent, and incandescent readouts constituted the majority of instrument display devices then. Today, the venerable “Nixie” tube, the prototypical gas-discharge device, is still in use. And its successors continue to offer high readability and low cost. However, over one half of all instrument types now use LEDs and that fraction is growing and, according to most major instrument manufacturers interviewed by Spectrum, will continue to grow."
"Depending on who you talk to, the BART saga thus far is seen either as a tragedy or, at best, a mock epic. Avid Spectrum readers have followed the chronicle from design and development to the surprise accident of October 2, 1972, when a crystal oscillator in the automatic train operating (ATO) subsystem transmitted the wrong speed command and a BART train overran the Fremont station, plowing into a sandpile installed for just such a circumstance. The chapters following that episode have delineated investigations and reports, suits and countersuits (the most recent, BART's $237.8 million damage suit against its consultants and suppliers). But BART rolls on, as does its saga, and this month's chapter deals with retrofits, or how engineers have \"edited\" a mock epic in hopes of transforming it into an unqualified epic. The principal problems and disagreements centered on the original procurement procedures and on the selection and implementation of the automatic train control (ATC) system. Even now, as a $1.3 million backup system to BART's primary train protection subsystem is being installed, Westinghouse stands firm in its insistence that it is an unnecessary elaboration."
"New tools for the utilities include rate options, clock-actuated switches, radio control, and ripple control systems."
"The optical technique used in the speech spectrogram generator described here permits the analysis of signals having frequency components within the ultrasonic or very-low-frequency ranges, and the system is capable of examining large amounts of data continuously throughout the processing."
"The long-range telephone planner is responsible for formulating the plans for expanded facilities, and for helping to obtain governmental permission to build them. In New York City, for instance, planning engineers responsible for telephone exchange buildings must get a variance-to-build from the New York Board of Standards and Appeals (BS&A). They are also required to inform all home owners within 500 feet of the building site, and must have the approval of the local Community District Planning Board. The narrative that follows is a composite of many recent experiences of long-range telephone planners in the New York City area."
"IEEE announces a new computer-based service designed to get you only the information you need-quickly and inexpensively."
"In an important action, the IEEE Board of Directors adopted an IEEE Code of Ethics for Engineers at its meeting of December 4, 1974. The new code resulted from the combined efforts of a number of volunteer Committees and Boards within IEEE, specifically the United States Activities Board (USAB), USAB's Ethics and Employment Practices Committee, the Executive Committee and its ad hoc Committee on Ethics, and the Board of Directors. In addition, expert views were obtained from the Committee on Social Implications of Technology and many other IEEE organizational units."
"The MCS-40 microprocessor system is designed to provide control and data-processing capabilities previously unavailable in most low-cost microprocessor systems and is expected to be used in a variety of applications."
"Introduced at a price of only $269, complete with battery charger and belt carrying case, a handheld digital multimeter is one of the few recent portable instruments to come along with the capability of measuring capacitance. The model 21 also measures ac volts, dc volts, and resistance. It includes the following specifications: four full-scale ranges of dc volts from 2 to 2000 volts with 1-mV resolution; four full-scale ranges of ac volts from 2 to 2000 volts with 1-mV resolution; four full-scale resistance ranges from 2 to 2000 k- with 1-ohm resolution, and four capacitance ranges from 2 to 2000 nf with 1-pF resolution."

"Huge piles of garbage lie rotting in the streets of New York City as we write this message. Meanwhile, elsewhere, urban technologists are meeting to discuss highly efficient systems to remove refuse regularly and inconspicuously from metropolitan streets. The two images are incongruous. The New York rubbish heaps may be partly due to work slowdowns resulting from layoff threats by a City administration in severe financial straits, but an executive of the Sanitation Department insists it is simply a matter of the difficulty in redeploying a somewhat reduced sanitation force — the workers are presumably willing but confused."
"Certain concerns of engineers overarch all their special skills, efforts, and knowledge. On the one hand, there are “tools” of the electrical engineering trade: those general design techniques and methods of information-gathering that make all engineering design tasks feasible. On the other hand, there are avocational activities: the ”toys” that can give added meaning to the engineer's life whether he is actively working or in retirement."
"Examines the role of the computer in electrical circuit design. CAD now offers more sophisticated programs with Monte Carlo computations and tolerance assignment."
"Describes the use of computers to automate physical design and testing of computers and other electronic equipment."
"With thousands of design books available, covering all the electrical and electronics fields of interest, Spectrum decided to identify some of the top books. The list on these pages is limited to five design areas, chosen because they are related to other articles in this issue. The books were recommended after consultation with experts in computer-aided design and modeling, design automation, general systems design techniques, microwave design techniques, and power systems design techniques and planning. Books in these areas cover (and often overlap) such disciplines as decision review, decision analysis, and pattern matching."
"With microprocessor technology developing at a faster pace than most design engineers can follow, the need for special forms of education — to prepare engineers to evaluate and use these new systems-on-a-chip — has become evident. Responding to this need, conferences and publications concerned with conveying knowledge and up-to-date information about microprocessors have mushroomed."
"Reduced from hand-made originals or prepared directly by computer, microfilm data files claim size, access, and integrity advantages."
"The following is a guide to some of the sources where researchers, or the casual questioner, can find the data they need in a number of engineering and engineering-related areas. In addition to the specific categories listed, information on a variety of technical subjects is available from the Engineering Societies Library and from Engineering Index, both at 345 East 47 Street, New York, N.Y. 10017. For tabulations of reference materials, literature guides, retrieval services, and abstracting and indexing services, the reader is referred to Madhu-Sudan Gupta's Spectrum article, “Where to find it when you need it” (May 1974, pages 72-77). And elsewhere in this issue (pages 68-71), Oscar Firschein tells you how to keep up to date with “On-line reference searching.”"
"If you are surrounded by experts who can answer your every question, or if you are a researcher in a narrow field of specialization and communicate with other leaders in the field throughout the world, or if your work is \"cut and dried\" and no problems arise that require outside reference work, then you are in a near utopia and computerized retrieval is not for you. On the other hand, if you are finding it difficult to track your field and feel that some of your problems may be answered in unfamiliar journals, government reports, or foreign journals; or if you lack access to an adequately equipped technical reference library; or if you desire to be informed automatically and quickly of the latest references in your field; then computerized retrieval may be the very thing you need."

"Documenting the history of their profession seems to be a popular leisure-time pursuit among electrical and electronics engineers. Collectors and collections abound. Exhibitions range from one at the prestigious Smithsonian, where there are warehouses full of donations still to be unpacked, to small private collections of glass insulators or telegraph keys. The following list serves not only the dedicated historian but the casual sightseer who might be interested in anything from old-time trolleys to antique telephones to memorabilia of some of the profession's best-known pioneers. Exhibit locations are called out in blue so that readers can identify items of interest in their areas, and it should be noted that the list presents only a sampling of the many collectors and groups actively devoted to preserving the romance of engineering's past — and its artifacts."
"In case you weren't aware of it, there are magazines on everything! Spectrum found this out when it set about putting together a reference bookshelf on EE leisure-time activities. What follows is a selection of some key magazines on the most popular of those activities, as well as a listing of current books recommended, for the most part, by the editors of those magazines. The bookshelf is organized by popularity of the activity (see this issue, pp. 72-75), beginning with photography."
"This low-noise, high-performance, operational amplifier, part of a series, incorporates junction field-effect transistors (JFETs) on the same chip with standard bipolar transistors. The 15 op amps in the series replace expensive hybrid and module devices in such applications as precision high-speed integrators, fast A/D and D/A converters, high-impedance buffers, logarithmic amplifiers, sample-and-hold circuits, photocell amplifiers, and amplifiers that combine wide bandwidth, low noise, and low drift."

"Engineers who have been involved directly or peripherally in forecasting the technological future know it is a game fraught with hazards — both real and psychological."
"Betting men will always profit by wagering against the realization of technology forecasts — at least in the detail, including specific time frames, that is frequently attached to such forecasts. Perhaps the most that can be gained from long-term technology forecasting is a more accurate gage of developments in the short term. Yet even that may be worth the effort. Critics who deride forecasting as a futile exercise that cannot yield accurate results overlook its value in helping define critical prerequisite developments and in establishing probable technology trees. At the very least, forecasting helps focus the ideas of our “best guessers.”"
"Fiber optics and digital microwave may be fast-moving areas in the otherwise ponderous progress of future communications."
"Shrinking processors, hardening software, and displaced programmers are some of the startling features of the possible future computer landscape. Rapid change has been the law of development of modern computers since their beginnings in the 1950's, and no one is predicting the repeal of that law during the next few decades."
 "Complex measuring systems with sensors providing inputs much like nerves in the human nervous system, instrument `service bureaux' that receive transducer inputs from customers and return measurement data to them, and instruments that generate signals for an entire test sequence with a single key stroke-these are but a few of the exciting new instrumentation developments in the offing. The technological `breakthroughs' in the instrumentation art will occur when ways are found to meet present and future measurement needs and as technological breakthroughs in other areas motivate the conception of new kinds of instruments."
"Silicon technology will underlie the next generation of higher performance ICs, and optical devices will play a bigger role."
"A bookshelf on forecasting? Why would a skilled engineer already bombarded with trade journals, books, and extension courses relating to his or her specialty be concerned with activities long tainted by tea leaf and tarot card? After all, doesn't current technical literature already contain the few relevant estimates and trend lines of real concern?"
"Unless effective measures are quickly taken, the United States is faced with the grim possibility of electricity shortages by the end of the decade. These shortages could manifest themselves in localized brownouts and even blackouts — the all-too-possible nadir of a decline in reliability and service stemming from the currently forecast effects of continuing utility financial difficulties. Such brownouts and blackouts would certainly have a dire effect not only on the residential consumer, but on an economy trying to recover from present recessionary trends."
"Public pressure stemming from blackouts, energy shortages, environmental concerns, and the growing threat of Federal intervention in the power field have combined to galvanize the utility industry into taking action by forming the Electric Power Research Institute, or EPRI. Set up in 1973 to manage a coordinated R&D program on behalf of the entire utility industry, EPRI has embarked on a four-pronged program that is presently looking into nuclear power; fossil fuels; transmission and distribution; and energy systems, environment, and conservation. Some of the more interesting efforts, which will be described in greater detail further on in this article, include: a computer code for plutonium recycle in light water reactors, coal conversion into fuel products containing low quantities of ash and sulfur, and simplified methods of effecting cable splices."
"Today the digital computer is as accepted a part of the business and industrial environment as fluorescent lights, copying machines, and all the other paraphernalia of the modern business world. Which is why when I remember back thirty-four years to the time J. Presper Eckert and I were discussing how to build the world's first completely electronic computer, I am struck by how terribly difficult it was to sell the idea."
"Only three short years ago, the HP-35 (featuring Reverse Polish Notation) was introduced and soon won the praise and acceptance of engineers everywhere at an initial $395. But on a strict cost/performance basis, the “veteran” of portable scientific calculators could be headed toward early retirement. Hewlett-Packard's latest pocket marvel, the scientific HP-21 at $125, retails $70 below the current price of an HP-35! Not only is the HP-21 cheaper, it also includes a degree/radian switch and handles inverse trig functions, two useful features its older brother lacks. Using fewer batteries and logic chips than any other H-P portable calculator, the HP-21 operates five hours on a full charge."

"Russell Baker, The New York Times' sharp-witted and sometimes acid-tongued syndicated columnist, is inclined to comment on sociotechnical issues in a way that is not complimentary to technologists, but that, at the same time, usually contains an element of truth."
"In the 1960s, a popular exercise in and out of the power industry was predicting the golden age that was dawning upon the world (and especially the United States) in which cheap electric energy would be the catalyst in achieving the Nirvana of unparalleled leisure and prosperity. There were glowing descriptions of nuclear power plants mushrooming up (without the familiar cloud) all over the country; plants that would fulfill every need — from fantastic labor-saving appliances that would transform homes into push-button paradises to vast industrial growth and galloping increases in GNP. All of this was based, of course, on the instant ability of that little imp, “Reddy Kilowatt,” to plug into that bottomless cornucopia of electricity at bargain-basement rates."
"North Star Steel, operating out of St. Paul, Minn., is a U.S. steel producer not known to the general public. Desiring to expand its operations by the construction of a new mill, North Star studied its needs — the location of the probable market and the availability of resources, labor, and transportation — to determine the best possible site for its new plant. From nearly every point of view, southeastern Michigan, specifically the Detroit area, seemed ideal. But operating a steel mill means hefty power requirements. In the case of North Star's planned facility, the projected high-powered 100-ton furnace would require about 40 MW of electric capacity. The question in the minds of management was: Could either Detroit Edison or Consumers Power (the two troubled Michigan utilities — see Spectrum, March, pp. 40—44, and April, pp. 62—65) be depended on? Said North Star vice president Theodore Leja:"

"An interface system definition, one optimized for the interconnection of programmable bench instruments, must contain many vital communication capabilities if it is to interconnect independently manufactured products at reasonable costs.

"Low-density digital recording on magnetic tape, in one form or another, has been used for many years, mostly in data-processing applications such as computer input and output, and, more recently, in storage of complex computer programs. On the other hand, high-density digital recording is a relatively new technology, used mostly in data acquisition, in cases where highly significant data are digitized and recorded in digital form at the source, and the quantity of data to be recorded per unit of time makes it impractical to use lower density recording techniques. Such data-acquisition applications range from space probes and satellites to less complicated earth-borne testing. Also, it is not inconceivable that, with the proper input and output interfaces, high-density digital recording might some day provide more efficient means of computer data storage."

"In today's business and professional world, mention of the term conflict of interest gains instant attention. It denotes something to be avoided at all costs, when, indeed, in its general sense, conflict of interest is unavoidable. Governments, corporations, and institutions are prey to it. Whole professions exist to adjudicate conflicts of interest; lawyers do it, judges do it, managers do it, and yes, even engineers do it."
"On February 27, 1975, at approximately 12:15 a.m., a fire broke out in a New York Telephone Company central office, located at 13th Street and Second Avenue in New York City's Borough of Manhattan. The fire, which started in the building's basement cable vault, raged out of control, damaging or totally destroying millions of dollars worth of telephone equipment. The result: an unprecedented, total telephone communications blackout in the affected subscriber area, and its environs, disrupting service to over 160 000 residential and business subscribers."
"When the wires from a home telephone reach the local switching exchange, they enter a system that is unfamiliar to most telephone users - even to those who are engineers. Modern direct dial telephone systems are enormous. In fact, they are the most complex interconnected, automatic systems man has devised. As users we are generally aware of the telephone system only when it frustrates or fails us. But whether we think of them as interesting engineering designs or as increasingly important tools for daily living, telephone systems bear closer examination."
"Only about 51 percent of all British households now have telephones, and the demand for new installations is very strong. At present there are 12.6 million telephone lines in use in Britain.

"According to nearly 50 0(K) returns from the latest IEEE membership survey, although most of the members are working (1.7 percent of the Institute's U.S. members reported that they were involuntarily unemployed), many are working for less “real” money. To update membership statistics derived from surveys conducted in 1972 and 1973, IEEE mailed out 112 707 questionnaires, to U.S. members only, between late January and mid-February of this year. The questionnaires requested not only employment and salary data but also opinions of the respondents on a variety of topics ranging from job discrimination to the IEEE's responsiveness to the nontechnical professional needs of its members. Over 40 percent of the recipients responded by the March 14, 1974, cut-off date, thereby providing an excellent picture of the status and feelings of the U.S. member."
"Great Britain is coal country. And the logic in rail transportation, from the beginning, was steam. Consequently, one of the first European nations to operate a rail system became one of the last to go electric. But once it decided `to make the switch'-which was not until after World War II-its program of mainline electrification was as rapid as its high-speed trains and, today, the British system is the model for those of its European neighbors."
"Milton J. Shapp, Governor of the State of Pennsylvania, thinks the Rail Reorganization Act — a Federal program, currently before Congress, ostensibly intended to rehabilitate the deteriorating rail network in the northeastern United States — may be a conspiracy on the part of the financially sound western railroads to “pick up” profitable eastern mainline business “at the expense of the less well-heeled railroads already in existence.” This and other outspoken views were expressed by Gov.

"In the July issue we opened the question of the role of government in regulating the practice of engineering. Some states in the U.S., we noted, are going so far as to restrict the use of the title “engineer” to those who are registered in the state. Others are pressing in the direction of doing away with the “industrial exemption,” which could require that EEs working for private industry would have to be registered. We concluded on the note that more and more informed observers believe that registration for all engineers, without exception, may be inevitable."

"On September 1, 1974, President Ford signed into law a bill called the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA '74), popularly known as the Pension Reform Bill. IEEE vigorously supported this bill and took an active role in furthering various amendments specifically tailored to assist the employed engineer. Many members of the Institute are wondering what they should and can do to take full advantage of ERISA '74, and what IEEE is doing to solve their pension problems. Some of the questions asked by IEEE members about the current situation are covered in this article."
"IEEE's average U.S. member is making considerably more than he was two and three years ago. Nevertheless, as was shown in last month's Spectrum (July, pp. 46-49), he is not quite keeping up with inflation. This observation is supported by Fig. 1, which shows mean salaries by engineering experience for the years 1972 and 1975 as they deviate from the overall mean salaries for each year. While the overall mean has risen from $19 106 in 1972 to $23 883 in 1975 — a 25-percent increase — the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has measured, through its Consumer Price Index (see July, p. 46, for a discussion of the limitations of the CPI), a 26.1-percent rise in the cost of living. As a result, it can be said that, to keep up with the CPI, the U.S. member's mean salary should have been several hundred dollars higher than it is."
"In 1975, air travel is still a pretty safe way of quickly getting from one place to another; but there are ominous influences at work that are chipping away at the safety factor. Even in the vaunted air traffic control (ATC) system there are conditions in ferment that presage an erosion of the safety record to which the aviation community has always pointed with pride."
"A veritable revolution in air safety systems is in the offing 6368927 a revolution that will drastically alter the face of U.S. air traffic control as we now know it. At present, this revolution is in what might be called its “manifesto stage.” By this I mean that a raft of proposals have been offered by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) under the umbrella acronym UG3RD, or Upgraded Third Generation Air Traffic Control System. These proposals, if implemented, would mark the greatest change in air-to-air separation since the original establishment of separation standards in the 1930s. Further, navigation, surveillance, and communications would all be affected in a major way. The question devolves: What, exactly, would be the effect of this proposed automation program known as UG3RD?"
"In 1789, at the age of 14, André-Marie Ampere witnessed the murder of his father, the mayor of Lyon, by a mob during the “Reign of Terror,” following the French Revolution, when every titled person or official of the overthrown regime was subject to execution or imprisonment without trial. The trauma of this experience, plus the death of his wife in 1803, made him an embittered and reclusive person for most of his life. But it was, perhaps, this introversion that spurred him to the single-minded pursuit of the hallmark discoveries and experimentation in electrical science that have earned him a special niche in the gallery of modern scientific history."
"Ten IEEE offices, including those of the President and Vice President, must be filled this fall in the Institute's annual election. This means, of course, that the postman will shortly be delivering the ballots upon which IEEE voting members can indicate their preferences. To facilitate the process, IEEE Spectrum is publishing, as it does each year, brief statements by the candidates. For those who are unfamiliar with IEEE procedures, we shall review the Institute's election process: The IEEE Constitution provides that the President, as well as one of the three Vice Presidents, of IEEE be directly elected by voting members. The names of candidates for these offices, unless the result of petition, are selected and submitted by the Nominations and Appointments Committee. Those elected will serve for one year. Also appearing on the ballot are nominees for Regional Delegate/Director, as submitted by the Regional Committees, and for Divisional Delegate/Director. Directors are elected for two-year terms, with elections occurring in alternate years for even- and odd-numbered Divisions and Regions."

"Considerations of hydrodynamic stability impose severe restrictions on the design of electron and ion beam imploded fusion targets. Furthermore, in order to obtain a sufficiently spherical implosion, many target designs require electron or ion beams having a high degree of spherical symmetry. We have studied the stability and symetry requirements of several recently proposed target designs by numerical simulation using the computer program LASNEX. The ion beam targets we have studied are more vulnerable to instability than the electron beam targets."
"Use of double shell targets with a separate low Z, low density ablator at large radius for the outer shell, reduces the focusing and power requirements while maintaining reasonable aspect ratios. A high Z, high density pusher shell is placed at a much smaller radius in order to obtain an aspect ratio small enough to protect against fluid instability. Velocity multiplication between these shells further lowers the power requirements. Careful tuning of the power profile and intershell density results in a low entropy implosion which allows breakeven at low powers. Ion beams appear to be a promising power source and breakeven at 10-20 Terrawatts with 10 MeV alpha particles appears feasible. Predicted performance of targets with various energy sources is shown and comparison is made with single shell targets."
"In plane detonation waves of high explosives~ pressures up to ~ 1012 dyn/cm2, corresponding to fluid velocities of ~ 106 cm/sec~ can be reached by the employment of implosion and explosive lens techniques. If such high explosives, having the shape of logarithmic spirals, are arranged around the shaft of a hollow cylinder and simultaneously ignited from their periphery, an ultrastrong vortex collapsing towards the axis of the cylinder will be generated~ If thermonuclear material is placed in the center of this vortex and with a high current discharge passing through it, a stable high density pinch is formed~ The stable confinement time of this pinch is only determined by the lifetime of the vortex and confinement times well above the Lawson value seem to be possible. The amount of explosives needed is rather small and in the order of 100 grams. Alternatively, the collapsing vortex may be also formed by replacing the explosive with some inert material which is externally bombarded and driven by either a laser-relativistic electron-or ion-beam. A Taylor-stable collapsing vortex cavity can be also used to confine and compress laser- or electron- (or ion-) beam produced dense thermonuclear plasmas."
"We have irradiated flat targets, spheres, and hemispheres with intense REB (~ 1011 w/cm2) from the Hydra machine to study target loading, ablation, and implosion. A wide variety of experimental techniques were used in these studies including x-ray pinhole photography, laser holography, laser velocimetry, and flash x-radiography. The energy absorption mechanism was found to be consistent with classical electron deposition. Variations in target loading and implosion symmetry have been observed and, in particular, symmetry of loading can be altered by changing the cathode geometry and anode-cathode spacing."
"The dynamics of electron beams in large aspect ratio diodes is discussed. The role of plasma production and ion emission from anode targets is demonstrated by CIC calculations. The collapse of a hollow beam in the pinch process is simulated. The interaction of the pinched beam with a solid target is also calculated. Energy deposition is determined by the Monte Carlo method and the hydrodynamic expansion is calculated by the two dimensional particle-in-cell method. Bremsstrahlung emission is also calculated through the use of the Monte Carlo method. Self-magnetic-field effects are taken into account. It is found that the self-magnetic-field forces can considerably reduce the number of electrons escaping from the focal region by back-or side-scattering. The possibility of detecting self-magnetic-field effects by the bremsstrahlung angular distribution is discussed."
"Fine scale variations in the chemical composition of a dense plasma target (such as a plasma produced by a focused laser or REB pulse) give rise to corresponding spatial fluctuations in the electron density which persist until dispersed by diffusive or turbulent mixing. In the presence of a sufficiently steep background temperature gradient these density fluctuations are expected to give rise to mega-Gauss magnetic field fluctuations for plasma temperatures of about a kilovolt. Composition fluctuations would also produce resistivity fluctuations in low-temperature targets and generate large fields in current-carrying plasmas. This phenomenon may be of interest in the design of targets for electron beam driven fusion."
"This paper discusses the calculated behavior of fusion targets consisting of solid shells filled with DT gas, irradiated by high power electron or ion beams. The current required for breakeven with gold shells is 500-1000 MA, independent of target radius and nearly independent of beam voltage in the 1/2-1 MeV range. Above 1 MeV the breakeven current increases because of the increased bremsstrahlung production by the beam electrons. By using a diamond ablator and a gold pusher, the breakeven current is reduced to 220 MA. The ion current required for breakeven (about 10 MA of protons) is independent of proton voltage above 10 MeV with gold shell targets. Below 10 MeV the range of the proton becomes too short for efficient coupling, and the required current increases, but the power does not. Various aspects of the symmetry and stability of the implosion are discussed. We find that the relatively long deposition lengths of electrons result in relatively small growths of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability during the acceleration of the pusher, resulting in a relatively stable implosion."
"Double shelled pellets seem attractive for the current generation of relativistic electron beam machines such as HYDRA because of the low density of the energy deposited in the relatively heavy shell. This low energy density yields implosion speeds of the order of 1 cm/μsec, which is insufficient to compress and heat the fuel to fusion conditions. Because of the expectation that the inner shell of a double shelled pellet would move at a greater implosion velocity than the outer shell, an investigation was made with computer simulation codes to determine whether such a pellet could produce neutrons, what would be the best design of such a pellet for the HYDRA device, and what problems we might expect."
"A diffusion theory for the collisional interaction of relativistic electron beams with high-atomic-number plasmas* is used to develop analytical expressions for the beam-momentum distribution function in a slab target or plasma for the case of a normally-incident, well-collimated, monoenergetic beam with any radial profile. Moments of the distribution function are calculated for a Gaussian incident profile of arbitrary width. Using these, contour plots of energy deposition and current flow are determined. Bremsstrahlung intensity profiles corresponding to pinhole photographs of tightly-pinched beams are presented for various ratios of incident beam width to electron range. Theoretical deposition profiles, current transmission, and energy coupling of beam to target are compared with the results of Monte Carlo calculations."
"Some of the characteristics of particle beams used in various fields such as electron microscopy, microwave tubes, particle accelerators and various aspects of fusion research, are contrasted and compared. Starting with a discussion of the very simplest type of beam in paraxial approximation, the concepts of emittance and perveance are introduced. These characterize respectively the degree of disorder of the beam, and the effect of the smoothed out self electric and magnetic fields of the particles. Simple models illustrate some of the types of behaviour encountered in more complex systems. Alternative descriptions of some of these phenomena are discussed, and some effects associated with \"negative mass\" instability in annular systems are described."
"The time dependent evolution of electron and ion flow in large aspect-ratio relativistic diodes is studied by analytic models and computer simulation. Four distinct phases are considered: (1) Pure electron flow at low voltages, (2) Weak pinching at large voltages, (3) Collapsing pinch due to time dependent ion emission from anode plasma and (4) Steady-state pinched electron flow and laminar ion flow. The physics incorporated in a new, time dependent, simulation code is outlined and the simulation results are compared to the analytic predictions. In particular, we find that in phase (4) the ion current may be larger than the electron current and present day accelerators may thus produce mega-ampere ion currents."
"The process of pinch formation in large aspect ratio diodes has been studied by means of streak photography and time-resolved x-ray detectors. A tight pinch is formed at the anode center by a collapsing thin hollow electron beam. The collapse velocity depends, amongst other things, on the type of material in the top 1 μm layer of the anode. In a tentative model it is assumed that an anode plasma is at least partially created from gases released from the surface layer of the anode by the heating action of the beam. These gases are ionized by primary, backscattered, and secondary electrons. Ions emitted from this plasma modify the electron trajectories in the diode leading to a radial collapse of the hollow electron beam. The observed monotonic dependence of the collapse velocity on the atomic number of the anode material can be explained by the smooth dependence on Z of both the specific heat and the electron backscatter coefficient. In the case of high-Z anodes the ion expansion time appears to be the factor limiting the collapse velocity. Detailed experimental data are presented."
"High current pinched electron flow in diodes is shown to be self-limiting in the sense that for given diode voltage the electron current approaches a limiting value as R/d (cathode radius/gap) → ∞. The consequence is that in order to achieve electron impedances Ze <; 1Ω, one may have to e inject high-atomic-weight plasma into the diode."
"A maximum current density achievable in a diode has been determined from a previously obtained steady state relativistic constant of the motion for the beam fluid~ This current density limit has been used together with the purely radial and purely axial flow limits of the fluid equations to establish a minimum pinch radius for the beam which can be expressed in terms of macroscopic diode parameters. This expression has been combined with a Child-Langmuir emission law to obtain a necessary condition for optimal pinching. In this paper we list and discuss several electron beam machines, both present and proposed, in the light of this pinching condition."
"The use of electrical, optical, x-ray, and particle diagnostics to characterize the production of anode plasma and to monitor its influence on beam generation and focusing are reviewed. Studies using the Nereus accelerator show that after cathode turn-on, deposition of several kJ/gm on the anode is necessary before ions from hydrocarbons, adsorbed gases, and heavier metallic species are detected. The actual time at which ions are liberated depends on several factors, one of which is the specific heat of the anode substrate. Once formed, anode ions cross the A-K gap (With an energy equal to the diode voltage) and interact with the cathode to produce an axially peaked beam profile, a “pinch” which does not follow the critical current criterion. Experiments with externally generated anode plasma show that this type of pinch can be attracted to localized areas on the anode. Preliminary observations on Hydra indicate the anode plasma composition is similar to that on Nereus. The effect of this plasma on pinch dynamics currently is under investigation."
"Recent investigations showed that high current REB's may be effectively focused in the accelerating gap of a diode [1,2]. Achieved values of the electron-beam energy density have permitted model experiments on the implosion of spherical shells for compression and heating of D-T pellets up to fusion conditions [2,3,4]. The realization of pellet ignition according to such a scheme may be accompanied by the destruction of the diode. Therefore it is preferable to focus the electron beam on the target placed at a sufficient distance from a diode. However, until now, the necessary beam focusing in a drift space has not been achieved."
"The behavior of a cylindrical field emission diode (radial potential ~200kV) is studied in the presence of an externally applied axial magnetic field B ≲ 16kG. Observations made of the space-charge limited electron current (~50kA) compare favorably with theory which takes into account the presence of both the external axial magnetic field and the azimuthal self-magnetic field generated by current flow in the cathode. At magnetic fields exceeding the critical field necessary for cutoff, small but not insignificant current flows persist. The associated microwave emission suggests that this residual current is being driven by an as yet unidentified high frequency instability. Time-resolved measurements of the diode current and voltage lead to a determination of the expansion velocity of the cathode and anode plasmas. It is found that an external magnetic field of ~5kG suffices to stop plasma motion. This is in agreement with magnetohydrodynamic computations for a hydrogen plasma having an initial temperature of a few eV. Spectroscopic measurements of the diode plasma show that hydrogen is indeed the dominant ion species. Stark broadening of the spectral lines yields their number density."
"Typical current-voltage “trajectories” in pinched electron beam diodes have been characterized by a sequence of phases beginning with cathode plasma formation and expansion, a Langmuir-Childs phase, transition to and operation in a focussed beam made (where the cathode plasma is contained in the Bθ fields and forced back toward the cathode), and a final impedance collapse phase [1]. Recent experiments with tapered hollow cathodes have addressed the transition phase and indicate that formation of an anode plasma is required (in addition to the current exceeding the Friedlander and Jory critical current, Ic) before the impedance deviates from a Langmuir-Childs trajectory. Time correlated measurements of beam pinch collapse initiation, proton beam generation, and pinch arrival on axis are given. Once the pinch is formed the impedance is found to be within ±15 percent of the saturated parapotential value for the remainder of the driving pulse. Comparison with previous data indicates that a 300 to 450 J/gm dose is required to form the anode plasma (brass and copper anodes) and suggests that ≈ simultaneous achievement of I ≈ Ic and anode plasma formation produces a longer-lived, more stable pinched flow phase."
"The Pulserad 1140 (a 4 MeV, 45 nsec, 35 ohm generator) was converted to a 2 MeV, 1.7 μsec, 80 ohm machine by replacing the Blumlein with a lumped element pulse forming network. This generator was used to study diode behavior for microsecond pulses. Typical waveforms will be presented. The diode closure with a foil anode can be interpreted as a moving plasma front that reduced the anode cathode spacing. Experiments have been carried out to determine this closure velocity as a function of magnetic field and cathode material. The impedance as a function of time and magnetic field are also presented for a foilless diode."
"Energy transfer by a relativistic electron beam is restricted by the interaction of the electrons with the magnetic fields produced by the total beam and plasma current. In the absence of plasma current, various proposed configurations of current have an effective limit for energy carried by the electrons approximately equal to the conventional Alfven limit. This restriction appears to prevent establishment of energy transport sufficient for fusion application. If plasma currents are included, the total current may lie within the Alfven limit. Analytic models have been developed which predict the rate of radial collapse of the beam current. which is very slow if classical plasma conductivity is assumed. The beam is initially very unstable against breakup into fine current filaments and as pinching occurs. to other unstable modes of development of transverse structure. Those affect overall current concentration and focusing."
"In this paper is showed a possibility of effective (up to 75%) transmission of a high-current electron beam through a pre-ionized gas (p = 10-4 + 10-5 torr). Optimal beam transmission was observed with f = ni/neb ≈ 10 and total compensation of the beam current with c/ωp ~ 0.1rb."
"Self focusing relativistic electron beam propagating along the surface of ferromagnetic plate is attracted to it and reflected in the case of the diamagnetic plate."
"Proto-I is a 3 MV, 800 kA, 24 ns electron beam accelerator that is under development at Sandia Laboratories. It represents an initial effort to develop a scalable technology that is applicable to accelerators for electron beam driven, inertial confinement fusion studies. Energy is supplied to each of the two diodes from six oil-dielectric Blumlein transmission lines (PFL) operating in parallel. A Marx generator charges three intermediate storage, water-dielectric capacitors which subsequently transfer the stored energy to the PFL. The discharge of the PFL is initiated by the simultaneous closure of 12 triggered oil-dielectric rail switches. Data are presented on the operation of these multichannel switches. The two diodes have a common anode. Cathode diameters can be varied from 10 to 60 cm. Results of initial diode experiments and comparisons with theory are discussed. Plasma filled diode experiments are also reported, indicating pinch collapse velocities in excess of 109 cm/s."
"A new accelerator, designated Proto-II, is presently under construction at Sandia Laboratories. Proto-II will have a nominal output of 100 kJ into a two-sided diode at a voltage of 1.5 MV and a total current of over 6 MA for 24 ns. This accelerator will be utilized for electron beam fusion experiments and for pulsed power and developmental studies leading to a proposed further factor of five scale-up in power. The design of Proto-II is based upon recent water switching developments1 and represents a la-fold extrapolation of those results. Initial testing of Proto-II is scheduled to begin in 1976. Proto-II power flow starts with eight Marx generators which charge 16 water-insulated storage capacitors. Eight triggered, 3 MV, SF6 gas-insulated switches next transfer the energy through oil-water interfaces into the first stage of 16 parallel lines. Next, the 16 first stages transfer their energy into the pulse forming lines and fast switching sections. The energy is then delivered to two converging, back-to-back, disk-shaped transmission lines. Two back-to-back diodes then form the electron beams which are focused onto a common anode."
"Calculations of breakeven pellets imply the need for electron beams with total current of the order of 108 Amperes, voltages of a few megavolts and durations of about 10 nsec. The rate of increase of current far exceeds what has been achieved in existing accelerator tubes when driving small radius loads. The problem is in reducing the inductance of the accelerator tube and the surrounding dielectric. Several approaches are explored which are compatible with the use of electrostatically charged pulse generator circuits like those in common use. The technology improvements or developments necessary to achieve breakeven in systems with one or two beams are described."
"When the energy required of electron beams greatly surpasses present capability, it will be advantageous to use inductive rather than capacitive storage for the prime energy source. This paper deals with development of technology for charging a storage inductor and for switching and transforming its stored energy for generation of an electron beam. A chemically powered generator which compresses magnetic flux provided by a superconducting co is utilized along with high efficiency pulse transformers. Design concepts and experimental results are presented."
"This paper presents analysis relating to the feasibility of using low voltage (100 keV) pulsed electron beams for fusion pellet heating. The rationale behind the multi-module approach is developed. Analysis pertaining to the identification of specific module characteristics is presented, and 100 keV electron beam physics is discussed. The results of the analysis are that near state-of-the-art pulsed power technology is adequate for module fabrication and that the feasibility of the concept depends upon the ability to transport and focus the electron beams."
"Details of construction, technology and some aspects of future applications of the intense electron beam generator TONUS-2 with disk-type transmission line is the subject of this paper."
"Light activated multilayered silicon semiconductor devices have been used to switch at Megawatt power levels with nanosecond turnon time. Current rate of rise of 700 KA/NS at 10 KAMP, with 1 kV across the load, has been achieved."
"The double diode, or reflex triode, has been investigated experimentally. This device consists of a semitransparent anode located between two cathodes in a configuration which produces multiply reflected electrons combined with positive ion flow. The effects of the strength of the applied axial magnetic field, anode materials, and anode thickness were systematically explored. The voltage-current characteristics of the diode are- consistent with a theoretical model which includes the energy loss and scattering of electrons in the anode. Decreasing the anode thickness causes a decrease in anode voltage and an increase in ion production. Conventional operation is observed in diodes when the number of multiple reflections is reduced either by removing the axial magnetic field or by increasing the thickness of the anode."
"Startup conditions for future mirror fusion experiments require a rapidly formed target plasma of ~0.5 coulomb of ions with energy of 50 to 100 keV. Theory suggests that very intense ion-flux emission satisfying these requirements can be extracted from a pulsed ion diode. Developing such sources would be an ideal CTR application of the high-power, single-shot capability of pulsed power technology. Recent experimental results are reviewed in which ~2 kA/cm2 of D+ at ~50 keV was extracted. In the experiment, an intense relativistic electron beam undergoes many transits through a solid but range-thin anode foil. With each transit the electrons lose energy, causing their trajectories to collapse toward the anode surface. In so doing, the increased space charge extracts an intense ion flux from the anode foil IS plasma. Observations are reported on the importance of diode stability. The general agreement between theoretical scaling laws and experimental results is also presented."
"Various designs of relativistic electron beam diodes allow the production of very intense converging ion pulses† for bombardment of, e.g., pellet or rod targets placed inside a mesh anode. Ions formed by ionization of anode mesh material are accelerated by the self-consistent space charge produced by electrons from the cathode and target. In the conventional region of the diode before the anode, the self-pinching of the electron flow largely decouples the ion acceleration region from the electron source, so that the space charge does not quench the electron current. The steady-state equations for the magnetic field-free ion-acceleration regions of such diodes are analyzed in several goemetries, and the formation and effects of virtual cathodes are discussed. Efficient conversion (>;50%) of electron current into ion current is predicted."
"Recent advances in pulsed high power ion beam technology make possible the creation of intense ion-rings with strong self-magnetic fields by single pulse injection. Such ion rings have several uses in controlled fusion, e.g., to produce a min |B| magnetic geometry with a mirror ratio much higher than is possible with external conductors. For even stronger ion rings a min |B| geometry with closed lines of force (ASTRON type) can be created. For this purpose, since the ion energies required are much higher than are available from high power sources, magnetic compression can be utilized to increase the ion energy. The success of this scheme depends critically on the stability of the ion ring. The low frequency perturbations of the ring-plasma system is examined by means of a generalization of the energy principle which established sufficient conditions for stability. The high-frequency micro-instabilities and their nonlinear consequences are discussed in terms of conventional techniques."
"Calculations have shown that efficiently generated and focused ion beams could have significant advantages over electron beams in achieving ignition of inertially-confined thermonuclear fuel. Efficient ion beam generation implies use of a good ion source and suppression of net electron current. Net electron flow can be reduced by allowing electrons to reflex through a highly transparent anode or by use of transverse magnetic fields (either beam self-fields or externally applied fields). Geometric focusing can be achieved if the beam is generated by appropriately shaped electrodes. Experimental results are presented which demonstrate ion beam generation in both reflexing and pinched-flow diodes. Spherically shaped electrodes are used to concentrate a proton beam, and target response to proton deposition is studied."
"The ion current of a reflex-triode has been studied as a function of the anode thickness, when a 400 kV positive pulse is applied to such an anode. The 11.4-cm-OD anode consists of solid polyethylene (or polycarbonate) film of thickness, 8, between 2 and 150 μm interwoven between 0.7 mm diameter meter wires spaced 0.7 cm apart. It is observed that the ion current increases with decreasing thickness for 12 <; δ <; 120 μm and remains practically constant for thinner films. Contrary to the predictions of a recent theoretical model, the ion current does not exhibit resonance-like behavior. For δ ≤ 25 μm, the results are in agreement with a macroscopic model, which predicts that the ratio of the ion current to the cathode current is given by 0.5 [1 + (2η + 1)-1 (mi/me)1/2]-1 where η is the average number of passes of a typical electron through the anode. The above theoretical estimates are based on time averages of space charge limited flows. Refinements of the theory are included in a new, one-dimensional, multi-species, particle simulation code."
"Prior experiments have shown that deep, nearly parabolic, potential wells can be created by the injection of electrons into a spherical diode. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that a large fraction of the input power can be transferred from the electronic space charge to ion motion provided the electron collection probability is small. However, the instantaneous power required for pellet fusion is still beyond the capabilities of existing machines. By utilizing the spherically symmetric potential wells found previously, the instantaneous power delivered to a small target at the center can be magnified (or bunched) by factors of 10-100. The measurement of these potentials, the comparison with a realistic theory, and an extrapolation to higher voltages/energies will be presented. Recent experiments are described which imply that bunching is present in a planar diode. Although the experiments were performed at low voltages (kV), the extrapolation with constant perveance is straight-forward."

"Relativistic, cylindrical, rigid-rotor equilibria for electrons are developed in the beam frame, and the corresponding laboratory frame equilibria are obtained by Lorentz transformation. Limitations of the two-mass approximation are thus illuminated. A toroidal equilibrium is developed that is based on the two-mass approximation and expansion in terms of the ratio of minor to major radius. The toroidal equilibrium is shown to have no unstable kink-modes or no Kruskal-Shafranov current limit as in a Tokamak. Small variations in the toroidal magnetic field around the torus result in trapped electrons if they are injected with sufficient transverse energy. The presence of both trapped and untrapped electrons leads to two-stream instabilities. Some comparisons are made with HIPAC experiments and the recent torus experiments at MLI."
"A Helmholtz coil configuration has been constructed where the magnetic field can be increased to about 10 kGauss in 20 μsec. Electrons are injected from a hot tantalum filament between two plates across which a potential of about 5 keV is applied. The electric field E is perpendicular to the magnetic field B so that the direction of the E × B drift is radial into the magnetic mirror. About 1014 electrons were injected and about 1013 electrons were trapped. The initial electron energy was about 5 keV and after compression 500 keV X-rays were observed. The confinement time is very sensitive to vacuum. Confinement times of milliseconds and good compression were observed at vacuum of 5.10-5 torr or less. Above 5.10-5 torr there was no trapping or compression. After a compressed ring of electrons was formed, it was released by a pulse applied to one of the Helmholtz coils that reduced the field. Ejection of the electron ring was observed by X-ray measurements."
"Earlier work1-3 demonstrated that intense sub-microsecond bursts of energetic electrons cause significant pulverization and spalling of a variety of rock types. The spall debris generally consists of sand, dust, and small flakes. If carried out at rapid repetition rate, this can lead to a promising technique for increasing the speed and reducing the cost of underground excavation of tunnels, mines and storage spaces. The conceptual design features of a Pulsed Electron Tunnel Excavator capable of tunneling approximately ten times faster than conventional drill/blast methods are presented with primary emphasis on the electron accelerator and only a brief description of the tunneling aspects. Of several candidate types of accelerators, a linear induction accelerator producing electron pulses (5 MV, 5 kA, 1.0 μs = 25 kJ) at a 360 Hz rate was selected for the conceptual example. This provides the required average electron beam power output of 9 MW. The feasibility of such an accelerator is discussed."
"Using a simple model of a relativistic electron layer rotating in an axial magnetic field, energy gain by an increasing magnetic field and energy loss by synchrotron radiation were considered. For a typical example, initial conditions were ~8 MeV electron in an ~14 kG magnetic field, at a layer radius of ~20 mm, and final conditions were ~4 MG magnetic field ~100 MeV electron layer energy at a layer radius of ~1.0 mm. In the final state, the intense 1-10 keV synchrotron radiation imposes an electron energy loss time constant of ~100 nanoseconds. In order to achieve these conditions in practice, the magnetic field must be compressed by an imploding conducting liner; preferably two flying rings(8) in order to allow the synchrotron radiation to escape through the midplane. The synchrotron radiation loss rate imposes a lower limit to the liner implosion velocity required to achieve a given final electron energy (~1 cm/μsec in the above example). In addition, if the electron ring can be made sufficiently strong (field reversed), the synchrotron radiation would be a unique source of high intensity soft x-radiation."
"The plasma focus is a remarkable natural phenomenon that achieves significant space-time compression of both particle and field energy. Depending on the mode of operation, about 20% of the bank energy can be concentrated into the kinetic energy of a thin, dense, cylindrically convergent gas shell, or into a small-diameter, high-ν/γ relativistic electron burst and oppositely directed ion burst. The kinetic energy of the fast ions and electrons can exceed the applied voltage by a factor of greater than 100. The different modes of energy concentration by the plasma focus are presented and discussed both in terms of their role in the direct yield of the focus and for the case of a plasma focus supplemented by various fusionable targets."
"The paper provides a short review of the present research status with regard to the Ion Ring Compressor. A consideration of the reactor characteristics of this fusion scheme indicates the potential for a number of technologically and economically interesting features, in particular with respect to the high-confinement characteristics expected for such minimum-B configurations. Experimental results from the RECE-program at Cornell indicate generally good gross stability of strong electron rings, including purely collisional decay, stability against field perturbations and others. Most-recent experiments have extended the ring lifetime to more than 2 × 105 electron orbits. Strong electron rings have been shifted over an axial distance of up to 30 cm. Experiments with magnetic-field insulated diodes indicate ion pulses of up to 300 nsec, and field insulation of up to 800 nsec when metallic electrodes are used."
"We report about a facility for the receipt of high intensity electron rings which has been built at the Tomsk Institute for Nuclear Physics. The TONUS accelerator has been employed with 2 MeV energy and 50 kA current as an injector. Injection is provided by the reflection of the compensated beam from the metal cylindric surface. The beam is injected into the preionized plasma of needful pressure (10-4-10-5 mm Hg). The magnetic field which provides the compression of the beam is created by 4 pairs of coils. The analysis of the mostly dangerous instabilities of the compensated electron ring has been made."
"Gas-laser-excitation with intense relativistic electron beams has gained popularity through many successful demonstrations of efficient conversion of electron-beam energy to laser energy. In some instances, electron-beam excitation of gas lasers has resulted in record laser energy and/or power, in higher efficiencies than has ever been obtained with any other excitation scheme, and in the discovery of lasers that have not been produced by any other excitation schemes. The feature of electron beams that make this laser excitation scheme so promising for use in high-power lasers is the high-power capability of electron beams. Three electron-beam geometrical configurations have been applied to gas-laser-excitation; electron-beam coaxial with the laser axis, electron-beam perpendicular to the laser axis, and radial convergent electron-beams. Measurements and comparisons with theory for these three geometries are given."
"Developments of the coaxial-diode VUV laser are reviewed. Frequency narrowing to 0.1nm and tuning over a range of 2500 cm-1 has been achieved with megawatt powers. A peak energy of 55 mJ (5 MW) is obtained with a pumping energy of 35J. The breakdown threshold in 10K Torr Xenon has been measured to be ~ 100 MW cm-2. Picosecond pulses at λ 173nm have been generated, by four-wave mixing, for amplification in Xenon. Future developments are briefly considered."
"High power pulse electron beam generators are now in service for preliminary experiments on high aspect ratio lasers. This paper reviews the performance of the existing POCOBEAM low impedance, first risetime, short pulse generators. These existing designs are considered in relation to future requirements for multi-cavity systems with multi-machine excitation of each cavity, and projected performance improvements are discussed."
"Reliable techniques for the determination of the energy/cm3 deposited by an e-beam into a gas as well as the energy/cm3 radiated have been developed in order to obtain dependable data on the VUV fluorescence efficiency for rare gas excimers. Spatially resolved total stopping calorimetry in the gas at the cell foil was used to characterize the energy distribution in the e-beam (~200 kV, few Amp/cm2, ~1 μsec) transmitted by a “hibachi”-supported 1-mil Ti foil. By using these data, suitable input for a 3-D Monte Carlo electron transport code (SANDYL) was generated. The spatial distribution of energy deposition in the gas was then calculated taking into account multiple scattering and cell geometry. The validity of the SANDYL technique is substantiated by excellent agreement between the measured and calculated energy flux on a vertical stack of five fast risetime (<; 1 msec) calorimeters at several depth positions [0 <; Z(cm) <; 15] in the gas [1 <; P(atm) <; 3]. Calibrated optical components were used in a well defined geometry that permitted calculation of the effective radiating volume observed. By using the above techniques, high absolute efficiencies (10-30%) have been measured for rare gas VUV continua emission which can photolytically produce group VI metastables [e.g., 0(1S),S(1S)] of interest as fusion visible-laser candidates."
"The use of electron beams for the direct pumping of lasers for fusion applications requires the generation of large area beams in appropriate geometries. Two geometries which are of particular interest are rectangular electron beams with planar anodes and radially converging beams with cylindrical anodes. The generation of such beams requires the management of electron trajectories in a complex combination of applied and self-generated electric and magnetic fields. The beam's self-electric field limits the emitted current, and the deflection of the electron in the self-magnetic field (beam pinch) limits the beam area that can be generated from a single cathode. A simple analytic model is used to derive a scaling relationship for beam pinch in both geometries of the form V1/2 w/d = α, where V is the diode voltage, w the beam width, d the anode-cathode spacing, and α is a weak function of the geometry. Numerical calculations are presented to show the effects of nonuniform electric fields encountered in typical geometries together with supporting experimental measurements."
"Repetitively pulsed electron beam generators must be developed for future high average power applications such as laser pumping and plasma heating for fusion reactors. We have begun the development of high average power technology at the parameter level required for electron beam sustained CO2 lasers, thus most of the results discussed were obtained from a system with the following nominal characteristics: average power 30 kW, beam voltage 250 kV, 50 pps, pulselength 3 microseconds, beam area 15 cm × 50 cm, current density 1 A/cm2. The parameter range investigated included repetition rates up to 1000 pps and pulse durations to 20 microseconds. Topics to be presented include: cathode erosion and lifetime, beam focussing electrodes in the diode, gas generation and vacuum system requirements, and diode impedance. The extension of this technology to the more difficult parameter regimes required for future applications is also discussed."
"In this paper we have described the two-sided 200 × 35 cm2 cold cathode used in the LASL dual-beam module 2.5 kJ short pulse laser. The characteristics may be summarized as follows: a) Electron emission begins on both sides within ~ 0.1 μs of application of the 50 ns rise diode voltage. b) The currents from each side of the gun are approximately equal. c) Early in the emission pulse, the electron beam fills 25 - 30 cm of the 35 cm high window; at ~ 3.0 μs, the window is very nearly filled. d) The gun efficiency (current incident on window ÷ total emission current) is nearly unity. e) Early in the pulse, the spatial distribution of the beam at the anode window consists of 10 - 20 vertical striations ~ 10 cm wide, and seems to originate from discrete and localized points at the blade separated by ~ 10 cm. The effect has not been satisfactorily explained. f) Later in the pulse, the striations have spread to the extent that nearly the entire window has been irradiated uniformly ± 15%. g) That portion of the beam that is incident on the top edge of the window is deflected downward because of the magnetic field of the HV feed. h) The emission current rises linearly in time after the first 0.3 μs; the plasma expansion velocity is equation 0.5 cm/μs."
"Various collective methods have been investigated (theoretically and experimentally). Two separate channels with pulsed electron beam of 0.5-1.0 MeV and 20-30 kA were used. Data on auto-acceleration o f electrons due to passage of beam through diaphragmed waveguide were obtained, particularly dependence of exit spectrum on waveguide and input beam characteristics. In experiments, group of electrons increases their energy to two-three times as a result of auto-acceleration. An improvement by using programmed wave phase velocity and by cutting the low energy part of the spectrum is discussed. Experimental data concerning acceleration of protons and deuterons up to several MeV due to electron beam passage through gas were obtained: ion energy spectrum, acceleration rate, influence of gas pressure. The role of the pressure gradient and of beam front velocity control is considered. Ion acceleration by shifting of electron beam crossover by means of gas lenses is discussed."
"In a recently proposed linear collective accelerator, ions are accelerated in a steep, moving potential well created at the head of an intense relativistic electron beam. The steepness of the potential well and its motion are controlled by the external ionization of a suitable background gas. Calculations concerning optimum choices for the background gas and the ionization method are presented; a two-step photoionization process employing Cs vapor is proposed. In this process, a super-radiant light source is used to excite the gas and a UV laser is used to photoionize the excited state. The appropriate line widths and coupled ionization growth rate equations are discussed. Parameter estimates are given for a feasibility experiment, for a 1 GeV proton accelerator, and for a heavy ion accelerator (50 MeV/nucleon uranium)."
"Growth of the negative energy axisymmetric cyclotron eigenmode of an unneutralized relativistic electron beam propagating interior to a cylindrical conducting guide along a guide magnetic field can be induced by resistive liner structures interior to the guide. Analysis shows these liners yield sharply peaked growth rates of the order of 5·10-3Ω, where Ω is the relativistic cyclotron frequency. However, such liners are plagued by resistive kink instabilities, unless 1) the magnetic field is operated above optimum for axisymmetric growth or 2) azimuthal shorting rings are included in the liner configuration. Unfortunately, such rings may then allow a hydrodynamic kinking instability at high phase velocity and growth rates (.1Ω) if 4ωp2 >;Ω2, where ωp is the relativistic beam plasma frequency. Although undesirable for growth of the axisymmetric modes, such an instability may be of interest for the generation of microwave power."
"Acceleration of ions by intense relativistic electron beams in a vacuum has been studied using the injector of the Maryland ERA. Effects of floating electrodes and an impressed axial magnetic field were investigated. Maximum proton energies above 16 MeV and proton beam currents of 12 kA were obtained. An impressed axial magnetic field of 1.8 kilogauss resulted in focused proton beams less than 1 cm in diameter."
"In this paper several observations of collective ion acceleration as a function of drift tube geometry are summarized. It is found that variations in the ion pulse resulting from variations in the space charge limiting current of the drift tube cavity may be produced by varying either the cavity length to radius ratio or by varying the ratio of the beam radius to the cavity radius. Furthermore, such variations are well correlated. In addition, several measurements of the accelerated ion energy spectrum are reported. For high diode impedance beams (ν/γ ≤ 0.4) protons with maximum energies of approximately three times the electron beam kinetic energy are obtained. On the other hand, for low diode impedance beams (ν/γ ≥ 1) accelerated deuterons with energies in excess of 11.5 times the electron beam kinetic energy have been observed."
"The collective instabilities (longitudinal and transverse) in the Garching electron ring accelerator experiment are investigated experimentally to find the possibilities to increase the holding power of the collectively accelerated rings."
"Technological advances made in the development of high-current relativistic electron accelerators promise to revolutionize the design of high-power microwave tubes. The critical comparison in this regard, concerns the electron emission mechanism operative at the cathode of the electron gun within the tube. Conventional microwave tubes incorporate thermionic cathodes which have emissivities of at best several tens of A/cm2. In contrast electron emission from the plasma-induced field emission cathodes used in high-current, pulsed accelerators is limited only by the self-forces of the electron stream acting within the diode. Under these conditions, the emitted current densities have typically ranged from 103 to 105 A/cm2."
"In the report are given some results of experimental investigations of microwave radiation of 10 cm band by an intense relativistic electron beam (6 - 8 kA, 900 keV, 1200 keV) in an unloaded waveguide placed into a longitudinal magnetic field."
"A REB (500kV, 13kA, 40nsec) was injected and trapped in a tokamak plasma (n ~ 1-3 × 1013 cm-3, Te ~ 60eV). Diamagnetic e measurement showed an increase of the energy density of 6.4 × 1015 eV cm-3 in the plasma. A shift of the current channel was observed. The heating efficiency seemed to be limited by limitation of the injected beam current due to insufficient charge neutralization and the shift of the current channel."
"A 1 MeV, 40 - 80 kA, 60 nsec electron beam was injected into a 2 × 1015 cm-3 density, cool (Te = Ti = 3 eV), 4 m long theta pinch plasma. Local time dependent magnetic probe measurements were made across a plasma diameter, including within the beam channel, and measurements of the plasma electron density and velocity distribution function within the beam channel were made by Thomson scattering before, during and after beam injection. With a beam cross-sectional area of 40 cm2, the beam to plasma density ratio was <; 10-3 and the interaction was weak, with beam energy coupling to the plasma of ≲ 1% per meter. Nevertheless, the observed heating rate was too large to be explained on the basis of classical collisional processes. Scattering and magnetic diagnostics gave heating rates and coupling efficiencies which disagree by as much as a factor of two. Net current density within the beam-plasma interaction region was higher than predicted by return current theory."
"Ignition of linear high density solenoid fusion reactors by electron beams is a potential application of this high power, efficient technology in a relatively simple plasma system. Principal areas for investigation of this approach are beam deposition physics, diffusion of relativistic electrons across field lines by turbulence, beam and plasma stability, generation of high energy density beams and reduction of end loss rates. Physics of the generation, compression, and deposition of beams in such systems are discussed. Reactor operating modes and generator requirements are outlined."
"The streaming instability is the primary heating mechanism in most, if not all, experiments in which the beam is injected into partially or fully ionized gas. In plasma heating experiments, the relativistic beam must traverse an anode foil before interacting with the plasma. The linear theory for such a scattered beam is discussed, including a criterion for the onset of the kinetic interaction. A nonlinear model of the two-stream instability for a scattered beam is developed. Using this model, data from ten experiments are unfolded to obtain the following correlations: i) for a fixed anode foil, the dependence of the plasma heating on the beam-to-plasma density ratio is due to anode foil scattering, ii) for a fixed beam-to-plasma density ratio, the predicted change in the magnitude of plasma heating as a function of the anode foil is in agreement with experiment, and iii) the plasma heating tentatively appears to be proportional to the beam kinetic energy density and beam pulse length. For a fixed anode foil, theory also predicts that the energy deposition is improved by increasing the beam electron energy γmc2. Presently, no experiment has been performed to confirm this aspect of the theory."
"Under conditions within a hot overdense plasma corona where the field frequency is much less than the electron plasma frequency and the field period is much less than the hydrodynamic expansion time, it is shown that electron field reversal heating can exceed the combined classical heating rates due to inverse bremsstrahlung (skin effect) and field pressure (PdV) by a factor ~ ve/2vi (half the ratio of electron and ion thermal velocities). In particular this rate can exceed the inertial expansion cooling rate at a collisionless corona density of ~1% solid core density and could be realized experimentally at core temperatures ~3-5 keV and microwave field intensities ~1 MG."

"After the solid dose of quantitative and economic papers in the November 1974 joint issue (with the European journal R & D Management), we hope that the current issue's emphasis on people and various aspects of their behavior in RD&E will be welcome. Of course, even in discussing project selection and resource allocation in Research, Development and Engineering (RD&E), one must always keep in mind the attitudes, skills, experience, perceptions, wisdom, characteristics, and behavior of the people involved in the process. Formulas and procedures for economic decision-making are only relevant and useful if they are compatible with the human and organizational realities of the situation in which they are used (or where their use is attempted). We hope that the November issue will stimulate a “flood” of papers from managers and analysts who have attempted to use formal models and rigorous procedures for decision-making in RD&E. We'd all appreciate their insights and experiences. The papers in the current issue cover a wide gamut of topics, including: personnel appraisal (Hatlan and Cuthbertson); strategy for growth (Ibuka); product champions and innovation managers (Jervis); use of technical information (Johnston and Gibbons); conflict in project management (Thamhain and Wilemon); and R&D evaluation (Augood)."
"An R&D evaluation method is described. Its development was conditioned by an earlier review of other methods and by certain local requirements. Although referencing a chemical-business system, the concept, and much of the procedure, can be applied to other R&D fields. Four separate and fairly simple computer programs are involved. The first three concern capital and operating cost (or income) estimates for a future commercial venture. The fourth program executes discounted cash flow (DCF) calculations over specific cash flow frameworks. Relationships between the commercial venture and the R&D required are briefly discussed; also, the importance of involving the marketing group in establishing, or verifying, relevant sales forecasts, etc. Overall, the method described offers a reasonably practical approach to the R&D evaluation problem. It is urged that evaluations of this kind be made at all stages of R&D progress."
"The well organized and efficiently run corporation is an integration of many related systems. One of these systems is the managerial performance appraisal. Firms are realizing that through the use of a well designed and coordinated appraisal system, efficiency and productivity can increase. The task of designing and operating an effective appraisal system which is integrated into the total organization is difficult but not impossible. The key in doing so lies in: 1) defining clear objectives for the system, 2) establishing the basic elements which affect the system, 3) scheduling the proper events to achieve an effective appraisal system, 4) obtaining top management support, 5) training the superior in appraisal techniques and 6) using the proper combination of appraisal techniques such as Management By Objectives, Ranking and Rating Scales."
"A consumer electronics enterprise grew from a handful of engineers and technicians in 1945 to a world-wide billion-dollars-a-year business today by adhering consistently to several principles: Developing original technology rather than relying on copied technology, creating new markets for new products, focusing on consumer products, and utilizing the most advanced technology for the products under strict quality control. These principles have been embodied in a series of new products that have been introduced by the enterprise over the years. They include the first tape recorder in Japan, one of the earliest transistor radios in the world, the first fully transistorized direct-view television set in the world, low-cost high-quality videotape recorders, and the unique Trinitron color picture tube."
"Project SAPPHO, which studied differences between success and failure in innovation, produced information both on the roles played by individuals in the innovation process and on the characteristics of those associated with success. Although the data do not permit as detailed an analysis as other studies which have concentrated specifically on gathering information about people, they do enable some of the existing ideas to be reviewed. Results show little support for the belief that `Product Champions' can challenge and overcome organizational unsuitability or indifference, but suggest rather that the power, commitment and experience of the Innovation Managers are crucial factors."
"The characteristics of information contributing to the resolution of technical problems arising during thirty on-going innovations in British industry have been studied with the aim of determining the patterns of information flow consonant with successful innovation. A number of findings have emerged: 1) Information obtained from literature contributed as much as that from personal contact. The innovation process is most efficient when these two sources are used in a mutually supportive fashion. 2) Different sources are selectively used to obtain different types of information. The choice of appropriate sources and in an appropriate order has a considerable impact on the innovation process. The choice pattern improves with the higher levels of education of the problem-solver and of the research intensity of the firm: 3) No direct correlation was found between the frequency of use of a source and its relative contribution to the innovation. Some vital pieces of information are obtained from sources infrequently used. Implications for researchers and management are drawn."
"Project managers frequently feel deficient in two particular areas. First, they often encounter difficulty in forecasting actions which may lead to unproductive conflicts and disagreements with those who support them. Second, once a conflict has developed, they often have difficulty in finding an appropriate method to satisfactorily resolve the disagreement. This research reports an exploratory study which focused on delineating a number of propositions on specific determinants of project management conflict in high-technology organizations. The sources of conflict uncovered were then empirically tested by polling the expert opinions of 100 project managers in a wide variety of task-oriented situations."
  "Derek R. Augood was born in London, England, on March 3, 1928. He received the Ph.D. degree in physical organic from King's College, London University, London, England, and the Ph.D. degree in chemical engineering from King's College, Cambridge University, Cambridge, England."

"One of the most discussed and philosophized-about processes of management — especially the management of technical functions such as Research, Development, and Engineering (R, D, &E) — is “communication.” In addition to the philosophizing, however, there has also been a great deal of measurement of various aspects of the communication process, as illustrated by the Connolly article and the article by Taylor and Utterback. There is, however, a very large application gap, in terms of using the results of the many completed communication studies in designing and operating R, D, &E organizations. Most of the studies reported in the literature (many of them in these Transactions over the past two decades) are based on specially-focused studies of one or a few organizations, except for the multi-organizational surveys. Therefore, like any research findings, they require adaptation and probably some further “development” before they can be applied in a specific operating organization. However, much of the data and results in this literature do have strong implications for management practice and it is a pity that more operating managements have not made systematic attempts to use them in design, redesign, or management of their R, D, &E organizations. Certainly, some of the “communication” problems encountered in any organization will appear unique — due to the particular personalities and situations involved in that organization at that time. Given that degree of uniqueness, there is still much in the communication literature that the practitioner of R, D, &E management can profitably adapt to his own situation. We would be very interested in reporting, as technical articles or “technical and management notes,” attempts by managers to do this, whether they are successful or not. Duersch's article on a business simulation is one of a growing number of attempts to systematically capture the dominant economic and other features of a company's operating environment and to deal with the inherent uncertainty by the potentially powerful methods of simulation. Again, it could be a worthwhile exercise for managers to attempt to formulate a simulation model of their own organization's environmental and management strategies. In some cases, even the early steps of the simulation — developing a crude flow model — can lead to useful insights and, perhaps, suggest beneficial policy changes. Another general method of “simulation,” this time of future technological developments, is presented by Sahal. Although this is not a simulation in the same sense as Duersch's, the methodology can also be used for purposes of planning and strategy development."
"This paper reports an empirical study of 115 participants in R & D planning in a large Federal Government agency. Two hypotheses were tested, examining the relationship between type of work planned and (a) the participants' perceived uncertainties and (b) the centralization of the decision-related communication net. The data indicate that perceived uncertainties tend to be lower, and communications nets more centralized, as work planned becomes more applied. Secondary findings indicate that increased decentralization of the decision-related communication net may be an adaptive response to organizational decision problems of high uncertainty. Further research is suggested, and some general implications for the working manager are identified."
"A business model is developed, based on the ideas of behavioral modeling, and two typical businesses are simulated including representations of environments and management strategies. The model is intended as a flexible framework for simulations useful in planning and is easily modified to represent particular situations, operating criteria, and available information. The performances of the two businesses are computed for a number of combinations of environment and management strategy."
"A `real' forecast of technological developments in farm tractors is presented here. The methods of Delphi and cross-impact analysis are used and briefly described along with some criticism in the background of the experience gained from their application. In addition, some purely methodological findings are noted."
"A number of variables were examined with respect to technical communication patterns in a research and development laboratory in the authors' initial investigation. Observed changes in technical assignment and administrative control were noted in three of the groups studied. Generally, the immediate response of a group of engineers to administrative change was to retain the communication patterns prior to the change. Changed technical missions resulted in less communication for a change group than for stable groups. Project teams depended upon links with the functional groups to which the engineers were previously assigned. A second study, eighteen months later, provides important data regarding the effects of change on technical communication patterns. The time lapse was sufficient for the administrative change groups to restructure their technical information patterns into self-contained entities."
 "The purpose of this announcement is to inform Transactions readers of the formation of our interest group within the Academy of Management. The Academy is an organization of management educators and practitioners whose principal objectives are to foster the general advancement of research, learning, teaching, and practice in the field of management. The purpose of the interest group is to provide a forum for academics and practicing R&D managers to “close the gap” with respect to a) the relevance of research on R&D/TI management, and b) questions concerned with the educational aspects of training for R&D/TI management. Formal activities of the group were initiated at the 1974 National Convention of the Academy of Management, with a program consisting of research paper presentations and a panel discussion on the teaching of R&D/TI management. Our program at the 1975 Convention (10–13 August, Marriott Hotel, New Orleans) will follow a similar format. People interested in the group's activities should be reminded that we interpret R & D/Technology/Innovation Management in a broad sense and consider it as encompassing the areas usually included under “research-on-research,” for example:"

"This is one of the issues (in contrast to some of our special issues and special sections) that covers a wide range of topics on the management of Research, Development, and Engineering, (R, D, &E). The topics range across the spectrum of the R, D, &E process — from the kind of problem solving that goes on in technical groups to considerations of customer response to product characteristics. They cover considerations of personnel, organizational and business structure, marketing, and finance — common components of general business or management education. An interesting feature of this set of papers is the large percentage written by people who are not in academia (an occasional criticism of the authors of papers in some of our issues). Two of the four papers are written by people currently in industry and the co-author of a third recently worked in a government agency. We would like to maintain such a balance of “academic” vs. “non-academic” authors and have been making efforts to encourage more papers from practicing managers and industrial or government staff members. The results of this three year campaign are beginning to pay off and we hope to continue to get high quality papers from both groups."
"Describes the research and development (R&D) phase of a hypothetical large-scale electronic system. The methodology, system design concepts, cost effectiveness and customer acceptance considerations presented herein are based on a synthesis of various R&D programs. An attempt is made to provide a quantitative evaluation of newly introduced `customer acceptance' parameters, which include such factors as maintainability, availability, degree of automation, operator approval and improvements over previous systems. It is concluded that such parameters should be given as much attention as the more familiar cost-effectiveness concept during the design process in order to ensure customer acceptance of the system."
"A procedure is developed to predict the performance of combinations of two businesses for comparison with the performance of the businesses operating individually. Included are general relationships of combined performance, the definition of several types of combination and their simulation using previously developed business models. A large number of computational experiments are performed to show the effect of the different types of combination, environment, management strategy, business model inaccuracies and of uncertainties in knowing efficiency factors and learning-curve coefficients."
"This longitudinal study examines the changes in career goals of engineers and scientists who were members of an organization undergoing significant changes as a result of environmentally induced pressures. Career goal data were gathered by questionnaires in 1969 (N=265) and in 1973 (N=373). The results indicate that some change in career goals does occur in response to changes both in organizational resource availability and in organizational tasks. Such changes in career orientation appear to occur primarily (1) among young professionals, and (2) among those without advanced degrees (indicating that organizational experience and anticipatory socialization occurring in graduate school serve to lessen the impact of organizational change on career goals). Other findings suggest that changes in career goals of managers may lag rather than lead changes in the goals of other employees."
"A number of claims have been made for the effectiveness of group brainstorming as a means of enhancing creativity in problem solving groups, and the technique has been quite widely used for this purpose. There is, however, little solid evidence for the superiority of group to pooled individual brainstorming. This paper reviews the available evidence, and reports three new experiments evaluating group brainstorming for engineering problems, using executives as well as student subjects, group sizes of 2, 4, and 6, time periods of 50 and 90 minutes, and mixtures of group and individual work. The findings extend and support the previous evidence of the ineffectiveness of group brainstorming for engineering problems. The pooling of individual brainstorming efforts appears to be the preferred procedure."

"This issue contains a wide variety of subjects related to management of Research, Development, and Engineering (RD&E), in contrast to the special issues recently published and in process (project selection, innovation, technology transfer, policy formation in science and technology). Three of the papers in this issue (Keller and Holland, Badawy, and Harrison) deal with organizational, personnel, and human relations aspects of RD&E. The Keller and Holland paper covers a subject crucial to RD&E — those special roles and behaviors of RD&E personnel that provide for and influence the flow of ideas and technical information into and within the organization. Much work needs to be done on this broad subject, and a large number of researchers are involved in it, including several members of our Program of Research on the Management of Research and Development at Northwestern University. The results of some of these studies will be reported in some of the planned special issues. Closely related to this subject is the issue reported by Badawy on differences in values and perceptions between scientists and engineers, who often populate different (hopefully cooperative) groups along the RD&E continuum. Harrison carries some of these ideas into the comparison between scientists and university professors."
"Boundary-spanning activity (BSA) was studied in two departments of a large governmental research and development organization. BSA was found to be higher and to have significant effects for employees when departmental goals were unclear and technology was non-routine. Under these conditions, BSA was negatively related to role ambiguity and positively related to job satisfaction. Contrary to prior research, this study found roles with high levels of BSA to have favorable aspects for their incumbents depending upon goal clarity and type of technology of the parent organization. Implications for the management of research and development organizations are discussed."
"Most research on the management of scientific and engineering personnel in industrial organizations has tended to lump both groups into a single category of `professionals' assuming that they exhibit essentially the same behavioral characteristics. Consequently, managerial practices for utilizing, motivating, and `managing' these groups have been largely based on the assumption of the professional `stereotype'. This has created a lot of misunderstanding and friction in the professional-organizational relationship. This paper reports some findings of a larger study conducted to inquire into the role perceptions of scientists as a distinct group from engineers working in three large industrial corporations. Findings of this study point out that scientists and engineers do not, in fact, perceive their roles, expectations, need systems, and value orientations to be the same. This suggests that managerial policies, motivational strategies, and organizational designs for R&D should probably be based on `professional differentiation' between various groups of technical manpower. Implications of the study for the effective management of scientists and engineers are also discussed."
"Two empirical studies of 95 research scientists and 155 university professors indicate that professionals in formal organizations perceive themselves at higher levels of role performance in the presence of the organic system of management set forth by Burns and Stalker in their research of the English and Scottish electronics industries in the 1950's. The findings suggest that managers should adopt the organic system with a view toward eliciting higher levels of actual role performance from the professionals in their organizations."
"Directed at the legal, engineering, and management aspects of product safety. A historical development of the law of products liability is traced through statutory and case law. In addition, the importance of governmental agencies in regulating product safety is explained. A pragmatic systems approach for enhancing product safety is offered as an aid to the manufacturing engineer."
"Defines the Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) function and illustrates the application of a large company's resources in providing ILS to a major defense program. Ancient and modern examples of ILS are presented as is the concept of ILS as an investment. The implementation of the defined functions-Reliability, Maintainability, Provisioning, and Maintenance Engineering are then considered as is their integration toward a common purpose-system support. This ILS is justified by consideration of the Life Cycle Cost elements."
"Sequentiality in decision making is an inherent characteristic of the R&D process. Conceptual changes are noted during the course of the project which represent a continuous improvement in the quality of the data available during the various project stages. When using single evaluation models, a contradiction is observed in that the same tool is used for varying conditions such as levels of R&D cost, time needed, and degree of risk and uncertainty at a given stage, with the result that the technique does not always fit the need. It is proposed, instead, to use a combination of differentiated models based on a stage approach for project screening, evaluation, and selection. The bases of this approach are: a) identification and utilization of specific attributes characterizing the individual R&D stage. b) selection of differentiated qualitative-quantitative models for evaluation at each stage. The selected models must be commensurate with the quality and quantity of data available at each stage. c) correlation of the magnitude of resources committed and the chance of project success. The proposed methodology is based on the adaptation of available models."
"Several formerly independent trends including the increasing rate of technological change, the demand for greater efficiency and productivity in R&D and innovation, and the need for applying technology to the solution of pressing social and economic problems have recently begun to reinforce each other resulting in renewed interest in technology transfer activities and research. The proliferation of research efforts in the U.S. and Western Europe, increased corporate and governmental efforts to develop mechanisms and incentives for transfer and the growing closeness between transfer and innovation studies led to the decision to convene a meeting with representatives from both research and practice in transfer and innovation in order to establish a “state-of-the-art” baseline and to promote discussion between the researchers and practioners from all sectors in the hope that new research will better reflect the realities of current practice and new mechanisms created by practitioners might be improved through the use of knowledge generated from research."

"Dear Editor: In the CSIT Newsletter of November, 1974, you quote \"Lifestyle Index\" to the effect that: \"It takes one acre of strip-mined coal to burn six 100-watt bulbs continuously for one year.\" When one of my colleagues pointed this out to me, I was a bit surprised. However, one gets used to surprising numbers — such as the number of cows that could be laid end to end on the major power transmission lines in the United States. Nonetheless, I thought the statistic worth checking. And to my surprise \"Lifestyle Index\" is correct. It does take one acre of coal to run six 100-watt bulbs for one year — if the coal seam is one hundredth (0.01) of an inch thick."

"Dr. CHAPMAN: As moderator of this session, I want to start by making a few comments. if the three most Important problem facing the world are war, food, and energy. all are related to tonight's discussion. Nuclear power and nuclear warfare clearly have something in common. Nuclear energy and the fertilizer that's necessary to produce Food clearly have something in common. And energy itself is what makes the wheel of industry go round and provides our jobs — and keeps our houses and hotels too warm."
"I received in the mail in my position as counselor to the student branch of the IEEE at Virginia Western a copy of Issue #9 of March 1975. Two things struck my eye causing me to write a short comment to you. These deal with both your editorial and the reply to the letters to the editor section."
"Age discrimination is illegal and is covered by the \"Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967\". This act calls for criminal penalties for second offenses. It specifically restricts coverage of the act to ages between 40 and 65 and covers Union and Employment Agencies as well as Employers. The number of cases involving Age Discrimination is increasing, and there have beer some recent significant damage awards under the law. This paper discusses some evidence that indicates a significant problem in the Electrical and Electronic Industries. It also shows evidence that the Aerospace Industry considered by some as age selective is not in fact responsible for any significant age discrimination."

"IEEE election time is here again, and I have been disappointed by the low ballot return in past years. These of course are changing times, with the engineer's standing in society and rewards both diminished from a decade ago. And the IEEE is also changing, vigorously entering into pension activities and other items concerning the economic aspects of engineering employment. With all these changes taking place, it is vital that the leadership move in directions which will best benefit and please most of the members. Your vote is important, as this is one of the best ways of steering the Institute."

"As stated in the Introduction, this booklet is intended \"to demonstrate how much energy each American uses each year, and to show how his or her standard of living compares with that of average persons living in other countries of the world\" (where, this reviewer is careful to note, \"standard of living\" is equated to \"energy units per capita expended annually.\")"
"The energy-environment problem in India and other similar developing countries is viewed mainly from the cost and availability aspect only. The environment degradation aspect is not of much importance. As this group of countries are mainly importers of energy resources, particularly the petroleum hydrocarbons, the high cost of oil is slowing down their already meagre rate of economic growth. The allround cost-push inflation in the aftermath of the energy crisis has made it extremely difficult for these nations to maintain even the status quo ante. Though their per capita energy consumption is miniscule in comparison to that of industrialised nations (India's per capita energy consumption is about 2% of that of the U.S.A.), even this meagre consumption is being priced out of their reach. The conservation ethic is strong and premium energy resources are being conserved and reserved for priority sectors only by government policy and price control."

"The book under discussion is an outgrowth of a freshman engineering course at the University of Massachusetts in which students take four 1-semester-unit mini-courses in various areas of engineering. A total of 13 authors have contributed to the book. Each chapter, after the first, deals with a specific area in a relatively broad and interesting way. Example are transportation, energy, air pollution, computers, materials, communications, and bridge building. The one anomaly, which clearly is out of place here, is the chapter titled Fundamentals of Electrical Networks, which goes into the usual gory details. This chapter contains more equation than the entire remainder of the book."

 "A braille electronic-calculator, an audible calculator, and a combination paper money identifier and light detector have been introduced by the American Foundation for the Blind. The braille calculator, priced at $345, is a five-function unit (+, −, ×, ÷, %) with an 8-digit display and floating decimal point. A single braille cell, using 4 dots out of the basic 6-dot braille notation to represent numerals 0 through 9, is activated by depressing a “read” button. The digits and decimal point displayed on a visual readout are presented in sequence in the form of small pins which pop up to form a braille digit. Reading speed, adjustable with a control, is variable up to 4 digits per second. The Speech Plus audible calculator, priced at $395, was developed by Telesensory Systems, Palo Alto, California. It has a 24-word vocabulary that announces every entry and result. It has the basic functions of the braille unit plus square root, accumulating memory, automatic constant, change of sign key, floating decimal point, and an 8-digit visual display. The paper money identifier was originally produced in the NASA-sponsored Biomedical Application Program and is now manufactured by EMR, Ltd., Los Angeles. A distinctive tone pattern is generated far each value of paper currency. A single switch change converts the unit into a light detector that can be used to detect lights in a variety of applications such as blinking phone lights, coffee pot “ready” lights, room lights, etc. It is priced at $125. All three devices may be ordered from Aids and Appliances Division, American Foundation for the Blind, 15 W. 16 St., New York, N.Y. 10011."

"The U.S. attempt: to develop a national energy; policy suffers from an apparent “leadership vacuum at the highest government levels” and does not even begin to come to grips with the energy problems facing as, according to Leslie C. Gates, president of NSPE. He sees a strong correlation between energy and economic problems and urges President Ford to call a summit conference on technology, “aimed at marshalling scientific and engineering resources to meet major national challenges.”"
"Provides a listing of upcoming events of interest to practitioners and researchers."
"The rapid expansion of electronics industries throughout the world in answer to increasingly sophisticated consumer demand is stimulating vigorous growth in the market for U.S. electronic components. Because of their technological leadership and ability to convert research discoveries into productivity, components manufacturers in the United States command a dominant position in the world marketplace — and demand for their products should increase, at least until their overseas counterparts are able to overcome serious technical and production problems."
"Arthur P. Stern has been elected President of the Institute for 1975, succeeding John J. Guarrera. Another result of the recent IEEE election was the selection of Joseph K. Dillard for the post of Executive Vice President. Both will serve for one year."
"Readers are invited to comment in this department on material previously published in IEEE Spectrum; on the policies and operations of the IEEE; and on technical, economic, or social matters of interest to the electrical and electronics engineering profession. Short, concise letters are preferred. The Editor reserves the right to limit debate on controversial issues."
"Dealing with people is a lot different from dealing with things. We know this, of course, but often forget it in our daily battles with the project, the equipment, our colleagues, and the boss, tending to see them all as equally intractable. Accustomed to unprecedented progress in the application of technology, we are often dismayed at the seemingly glacial pace of progress in the organizations to which we belong. This was underscored recently when industrial managers, behavioral scientists, and a smattering of engineers met to probe “Man and Work in Society.”"
"Scarcely a year goes by without worries that “overriding events” will hinder worthy new applications of technology. The year 1974 was no exception, nor, evidently, will be 1975, with rising concerns over the world economy, inflation, unemployment, fuel shortages, etc. Nevertheless, developments proceed, if not always at the pace their advocates desire. This special issue is a distillation of evaluations by hundreds of industry experts, including members of IEEE Groups and Societies, covering ten technical areas, and including a section on technology and society. By and large the reports avoid blue-sky projections, concentrating instead on near-future hardware and software."
"Large-scale integrated circuits — in the form of microprocessors, semiconductor memories, and logic arrays — continued, during 1974, to pace the changes in the computer industry."
"Inspired by growing demand while contained by the limits of bandwidth, physical plant, and esthetics, the telecommunications industry made important progress in 1974 toward providing increased traffic density and improved message-handling capability. Significant advances were made in the promising art of fiber optic communications; improved electronic systems became available for branch exchanges and switching centers; and new hardware and software for digital encoding promise lower-cost, lower-data-rate digital transmission of voice signals."
"Progress continued unabated during 1974 in device and component technologies. The push to make ICs faster and denser accelerated the development of: • I2L (integrated injection logic) devices, with the density of MOS (metal oxide silicon) and the speed of bipolar ICs"
"In terms of plant expansion, licensing, and the construction of much-needed facilities to keep pace with the increasing demand for power, 1974 was hardly a banner year for the power industry. Tight money, high interest rates, and fuel costs were primarily responsible for putting the damper on both fuel and nuclear expansion programs. Added to all that, the consumer really decided to conserve on electricity and cut back on his energy consumption by about 5 percent during last winter's fuel crisis/crunch. The effort proved to be a two-edged sword in that it had a reverse cutting edge, reducing revenues for the utilities. Thus, a paradoxical situation occurred: a rise in electricity rates for the nonuse of power — much to the chagrin of industry and the consumer. The utilities, however, blamed the increased rates on the exorbitantly high cost of fuel oil since the Mideast war of 1973. As a matter of fact, Dun's Review estimates that, on a national basis, the average unit cost of electricity increased by 55 percent in 1974 — compared with 12 percent during 1973."
"A mixed bag of seeds was emptied across the sociotechnical landscape during 1974."
"The ongoing economic downturn has spelled reduced profits and even losses for manufacturers of consumer electronics. The resulting shakeout has been characterized by big operations assimilating smaller ones, and more than a few troubled businesses folding their tents permanently. A period of retrenchment with minimized expenditures for research and development has set in. What innovation remains is concentrated in those products most likely to pay a quick dividend — portable calculators, digital watches, digitally tuned color television, and continued exploration of several promising schemes for home video players. Serious attempts also continue toward the development of electronic control and diagnostic systems for automobiles. Perhaps a forerunner of pollution-free personal transportation, battery-powered delivery trucks are being field-tested by the U.S. Postal Service in California."
"The path from initial concept of medical devices or systems to commercial availability is strewn with nonproducts — ones for which high hopes were held — that never made it to the finish line. Even those that do, often consume an agonizingly long time in the process. Recently, however, many significant biomedical engineering achievements have become available commercially — or will be available shortly — on a noncustom basis to those who need them. Notable among such products are a variety of aids to the blind, a neuromuscular assist device, and an inexpensive ultrasonic diagnostic instrument."
"More automation and computer hierarchical and direct control in manufacturing and testing mark the present and the near future in industrial electronics. The energy crunch is being felt, both directly and indirectly. Energy-conserving testing systems for automobiles are being devised and programmable controllers are being applied in industrial processes to increase efficiency and economy. Power semiconductor devices are growing bigger and getting smarter. The new buzzword is “standardization,” both in instrumentation and in software. CAMAC, a standardized scheme for interfacing computers to data transducers and actuators in on-line systems, and for the design and use of modular electronic data handling equipment, has begun to play a role in industrial control and measurement, both in the U.S. and in Europe. And a unified industrial FORTRAN computer language is in the works."
"Increasing speeds and more comprehensive automatic control of systems operation marked progress in rail transportation during 1974. In the United Kingdom, five-hour express service was inaugurated on the newly completed all-electric London-Glasgow British Railways run. Very-high-speed vehicles racked up thousands of kilometers in test runs on the French National Railroads. And in Sao Paolo, Brazil, a new mass transit service was inaugurated using an ATC (automatic train control) system similar to that of San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)."
"Despite a record-breaking $82.7 billion Congressional appropriation for defense in fiscal year (FY) 1975, U.S. Department of Defense officials are so squeezed by inflation and fixed obligations that they are looking forward to a lean year. On the other hand, research and development areas seemed to face a somewhat brighter budget future, but it is feared that here too inflation will erase some of the apparent gains."
"1973 trends like increasing computational power at eroding prices continued through 1974 despite runaway inflation in the rest of the world economy. Advances in digital- and analog-IC technologies, as well as in discrete and hybrid components, were primarily responsible. And one of the principal advances involved the microprocessor, introduced in laboratory instruments during 1973 and gathering momentum through 1974. Looking back over the year, highlights in instrumentation technology included:"

"The MC6800, 8-bit microprocessor unit (MPU) is being made available with supporting components including a 128-by 8-bit random access memory (RAM), a 1024- by 8-bit read-only memory (ROM), a peripheral interface adapter (PIA), and a single-chip 0–600 bps modem. All these components are TTL compatible, MOS n-channel, silicon gate devices, and only a single, 5.0-volt supply is needed for all the devices. The system uses a single bus organization that allows memory and interface devices to share the same address space. All MPU and system bus control functions are available on separate, TTL level pins, and no multiplexing or decoding is required for operation; interfacing is accomplished without additional TTL parts."

"Outstanding safety records of steam boilers used in power generation have been the rule in the U.S. and Canada for more than a half century. But, according to an article in the November issue of the IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, the era of safe power generation may be about to end because of a 1972 court decree."

"Whatever its limitations, and they were considerable, the conference represented here certainly succeeded in its main objective which was to unite, for three days of both formal and informal discussion, people who share a common interest in scientific journals but who are ordinarily separated by differences in their professional or business points of view."
"Better financial data promote better management of subscription income, and acctual basis accounting provides better data. Many small publishers depend on cash basis accounting and get systematic exaggerations of revenue and underestimates of expenses whenever costs, prices, or numbers of subscriptions rise. Subscription money paid in advance should not be fallow, but invested temporarily to generate additional revenue. Alternatively, this money may serve in emergencies to pay uncovered expenses. Subscription income goes further when cost-cutting ideas are sought regularly from the printer. It is speculated that the next round of increases in subscription prices may drastically cut the number of institutional subscribers to less popular journals. Some may not survive the change intact. Skillful handling of the business affairs of a small journal demands successful solutions to many problems. Several problems in managing subscription income are discussed in this paper: accounting methods, temporary investment, economical production, and planning price increases."
"Nonprofit organizations are established to perform a function of benefit to society, which would otherwise not be carried out or would need to be undertaken by the government. Although such organizations receive certain tax exemptions and do not provide a profit for their members, any undertaking that they become involved in must b e fiscally viable. In such nonprofit organizations, publications recover some costs from authors (primarily from author's institutions or granis) by levying page charges, manuscript submission fees, alteretion charges, and extra service charges, and through the sale of reprints. The bases for such charges are examined, as well as the percentage of income that they provide for several nonprofit journals. The conclusion reached is that a system of financing that spreads the recovery of costs equitably among various sources is desirable. It provides a nonprofit operation which, by its very nature, cannot build large reserves with the flexibility to shift the proportion contributed by the various sources if income from any particular source declines."
"At a time when journal subscriptions face an uncertain future, other income sources become increasingly important in providing the cushion against risk and the capital to modify the journal System. Considerations pertinent to advertising, copyright; permissions fees, reprints, and mailing list sales and interest each generate small but significant income for these purposes."
"Commercial and nonprofit publishers share certain characteristics; both require sufficient Income from all sources to pay the costs of publication and distribution, and both have access to the same sources of supply for composition, paper, printing, binding, etc. Commercial publishers seek a profit above costs to obtain a satisfactory return on investment, whereas nonprofit publishers and basically concerned with recovering costs. Professional society publishers have advantages in regard to government subsidies not available to commercial publishers (grants, tax exemption, page charges, lower postal rates); a built-in and sometimes guaranteed membership market with consequent lower initial risks and promotion costs; access to society resources; and the loyalty of society members as subscribers. Commercial publishers' advantages include the discipline imposed by capital investment risks and profit objectives, economies of scale, and the ability to make decisions quickly and to enter new or developing areas."
"Uniformity in style for scientific and technical journals is justified by savings in costs for authors, savings in redactorial costs, and more ready comprehension of text and tables by readers. Uniform style is readily imposed upon journals published within a single organization. Reaching agreements on uniform style becomes more difficult as the span of journals increases to independent journals within on discipline and to journals increases to independent journals within one discipline and to journals in different disciplines. Collaborations within, or sponsored by, the Council of Biology Editors, the Royal Society of Medicine, and the Nordic Publication Committee for Medicine illustrate the possibilities for intradiscipline agreements on style. Collaboration among different disciplines will be more difficult but should be a major aim in scientific publication."
"The European Association of Editors of Biological Periodicals (ELSE), which emerged from Council of Biology Editors' beginnings, was founded to promote and assist in raising the quality of journals in Europe. Besides dealing with specific problems of writing in English by scientists for whom English to a foreign language, ELSE is concerned with primary-secondary journal relationships, with the smoother integration of journals from smaller non-English speaking countries into the international information system, and with overcoming the time lag due to technical and psychological reasons. Despite cries about increasing economic limitations, there has been a proliferation of journals, societies, guides, and practices. Cooperation in the way of seeking uniformity while preserving individual character, providing redactory services, identifying referees, standardizing, and developing new systems of information transfer is discussed. The First International Conference of Scientific Editors is introduced."
"The possibility exists that primary-secondary cooperation may be more efficient at an international level and between organizations rather than between individual journals or services. Partly to test these hypotheses, the International Council of Scientific Unions Abstracting Board (ICSU/AB) established a Working Group on Cooperation among Editors. It has met regularly with wide international participation. One symposium, sponsored by the Working Group, was held in London in July 1973. The purpose of the discussions has been to improve the services rendered between primary and secondary publications. Among these are provision of statistical and fiscal information, of indexing and abstracting procedures, and of terminology and nomenclature. Primary journal editors can provide proper titles and abstracts early copies, and informed criticism of published abstracts and indexes."
"Standardization in typography, spelling, abbreviations, and citations provides a semblance of uniformity to a journal. Standardization guarantees greater flexibility in the use of copyeditors in an office that publishes several journals. However, journals in different disciplines lend themselves to different formats and styles: a large journal with many articles is more efficiently set in double-column pages of small type, while a journal containing many equations requires a single-column page with generous size type and citation of references in the text by author and date instead of by number. Such deviations from routine standardization keep copyeditors alert. Perhaps the most important area of standardization in a redactory office is in the procedures of checking galley and page proof. There can be no deviation from standard rules of proofreading. Finally, economics in publishing may dictate standardization in the future. Authors may some day be “compositors” when their typescript becomes the camera-ready copy. More standardization, not less, in the original typescript will then be required."
"The National Standard Reference Data System consists of data centers and other projects funded or coordinated by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) which compile and evaluate data on physical and chemical properties of well-defined materials. The output is then published in the form of tables of recommended data and critical reviews. In 1972 an agreement was reached with the American Chemical Society (ACS) and the American Institute of Physics (AIP) for establishing a new publication channel for the material, the Journal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data. Editorial work and preparation of camera-ready copy is handled by NBS, while ACS and AIP divide the other responsibilities. The progress of this journal is reviewed."
"The present lack of a widely accepted standard for preparing bibliographic references has led to activity in the Z39 Committee of the American National Standards Institute to develop such a standard. The current draft now being prepared is discussed, with sample references for selected types of material analyzed. Aspects of typography or degree of comprehensiveness subject to local option are also mentioned."
"The principle that manuscripts dealing with technical matters should be prepared for press by persons who can comprehend their meaning seems today logical and, indeed, essential. But for many years this function, if it were performed at all, took place in the printing plant. The change came about partly as the result of the separation of publishing from printing, and partly because the wages of type compositors increased to the degree that publishers could no longer afford to pay penalties for bad copy, or for the authors' alterations which were incurred if the manuscript was not edited for press. But now the wages of copy editors, like those of typesetters, have increased, even if not in the same proportion, and the expense of manuscript preparation seems to absorb an ever larger part of the journal budget."
"The management of time and money in the production of printed material is the foremost concern of the publications field today. In our complex, busy, space-age society we must communicate; and the printed word remains one of man's most important methods of doing so. It is essential, therefore, that we find a way to produce the volume of primed material quickly and economically."
"Two basic systems of organization and administration of a journal production department will be discussed. The first deals with specialization of staff: artists judge and scale art; proofreaders check (but do not read word for word) proof; copy editors with science backgrounds mark manuscripts; production assistants handle traffic and production. Control of schedules and performance is more easily attained under this system, but staff interest lags and frequent turnover results, under the second system, a production editing staff is trained in each of the above areas, thereby enlarging the individual's scope. The main disadvantage is that considerable increase in staff is required to permit adequate control and coverage. Combination and modification of the two systems are now underway. Other organizational aspects considered are selection of suppliers, cost control, shipping issues by air freight, editorial liaison (in-house and outside), and annual budgets."
"In 1929 the originators of the American Psychological Association's (APA's) Publication Manual agreed that “a badly prepared manuscript always suggests uncritical research and slovenly thinking.” The manual they developed became the basic style guide for the present journal production office where 14 copy editors and their supervisors produce the APA journals. Basic editing rules are to preserve the author's voice, to edit only that which cannot possibly after meaning. and to query generously. Alterations are controlled by letting authors see edited manuscripts before typesetting. Publication lag permits mailing time. Maillings have brought about author acceptance of copy improvements and the production office's understanding of authors, printers, and type specifications, copy editors are responsible for journals from manuscript to approving for press. Management concentrates on reducing long-standing variables and idiosyncratic practices. The Publication Manual is seen as a major influence in that effort."
"While what constitutes fulfillment varies considerably from one publisher to another, and even from one journal to another, the key word is always service. Subscription fulfillment is defined as the processing and servicing of subscriptions from any source. This can be accomplished in a number of ways. In fact, it is not unusual to convert systems several times to find the best way of fulfilling your subscriptions. The advent of the computer has made it possible to gather statistics and demographics more easily, and an analysis of the statistics is a basic tool in new promotion. As costs increase, greater selectivity is needed in list selection, advertising, and special offers. The basic source of subscribers is renewals. As much, if not more, effort should be spent on obtaining renewals. As much, if not more, effort should be spent on obtaining renewals. As much, if not more, effort should be spent on obtaining renewals as on seeking new subscribers. When do you stop seeking a renewal efforts when the cost reaches the figure for adding a new subscriber. Credit and collection efforts follow the same pattern. Fulfillment is a cycle composed of promotion, servicing, collection, and renewal."
"Recent developments in optical character recognition make feasible new modes of journal composition and new relationships among the author journal editor, and publisher. The stages of transition to new publishing arrangements are outlined, and the system presently being developed at the University of Chicago Press is discussed. The conclusion is drawn that use of a system based on optical scanning within a journal's production department is feasible for certain journals and will yield significant savings when compared with photocomposition costs."
"Micrographics combines the science, the art, and the technology by which information can be quickly reduced to microforms, stored conveniently, and then easily retrieved for reference and use. This paper describes the characteristics of the various microforms and the applications for which they are best suited. On an overview basis, filming techniques, film processing, and methods of duplicating microforms are presented. The hardware and processes for using microforms, such as readers, reader printers, enlarger printers, and retrieval devices are discussed. The advantages of microforms to business, industry, education, libraries, government, institutions, and many other areas of activity are also explored."
"Our approach to microforms was a consequence of the lack of protection for our considerable information output by the present copyright legislation. When we converted our journals to microfilm and offered them as such, we found that at least half the market already had them. Attempts to fight this situation legally have been futile. The only way to eliminate effectively the pirate microform editions has been the offering and promotion of authorized editions. When converting to microform for back files, the microfiche conversion can be a risky venture. Microfilm should always be preferred for collections. For simultaneous editions, the only medium is the microfiche, but publishers should be very cautious and should carefully test the market before launching a big venture. There are many surprises according to type of journal, but the audience also offers unpredictable features and changes its approach very rapidly."
"The National Technical Information service (NTIS) is the major source for information on government research and development and analyses; some 85 percent of the close to $20 billion worth conducted or paid for by the federal government yearly and made publicly available. NTIS shins 11500 information products each day, supplying, therefore, close to 4 million documents and microforms annually. Of this total, about 1500000 microforms (mostly fiche, 4 × 6 inches) were sent out in 1974, much of it through the Selected Research in Microfiche (SRIM), an automatic biweekly system in which microfiche are distributed to users in an extremely flexible system. For example, distribution can be made according to subject categories, subject terms, or even by subcollections, or any combination of these. There are more than 500 subject categoreis, more than 200000 possible descriptive terms, and subcollections that number in the many hundreds. The system employs 24 × fiche, although older parts of the collection may be 20 ×."
"The following aspects of microform will be discussed, marketing procedures and preferences; library support of bibliographies (indexing of microform collections); ways libraries can make their needs known to publishers; advantages and disadvantages of microforms; microform standards and quality control; choice between fiche and film; user reaction to microforms; publishing trends from the library viewpoint; and the question of the overall desirability and necessity of microforms for libraries in relation to rising hard-copy costs, storage problems, and ease of use."
"We are privileged to be here today. For the better part of three days we have the opportunity to cogitate and agitate about the future of scientific journals. We all thank IEEE for arranging this forum."
"The purposes of fills study were to find patients of refereeing practices, and to identify clues to recognize whether the papers in a journal are refereed or not. There have been several qualitative studies of refereeing practices. Other quantitative studies were concerned either with certain geographic areas or separate disciplines. This is a report of a small-scale but global study of a wide field of disciplines and/or missions based on a direct-mail questionnaire. A sample of journal titles was selected from me Linda Hall Library's serial holdings list. The questionnaire to assumedly refereed journals contained six pages and 70 questions. Answers came from 15 countries and 43 disciplines. The return was 72 percent. Another control questionnaire was sent to assumedly nonrefereed journals. The response was 61 percent. Ten percent of the selected journals was found to have been chosen in error in both categories. Editors of journals of varying sizes responded; the smallest received 10 and the largest 900 manuscripts yearly. The answers were handled by data processing using the SPSS (Statistical Program for Social Sciences), Journals were placed in two categories, small or large, so that all the small journals received the same number of manuscripts as those received by the large journals. Where differences between small and large journals were significant, the data are shown separately, otherwise averages are given. The questionnaire dealt with these principal subjects: Rejection by editor without mailing to referee; numbers of referees for long, and short, and for accepted and rejected papers; allotted and actual time for processing papers, guidelines for referees; rewards to referees, such as payment and credit line; use of superreferees in cases of divided opinions; keeping the referees informed on acceptance and rejection and on other referees; the relative standing of author and referee; acceptance and rejection ratio; communication between editor and author; and published guidelines in journal to author. Authors make recommendations with regard to the referee system based on the findings from the questionnaires and other discussions."
"The Journal of comparative and Physiological Psychology is a “society” journal; it is interdisciplinary, at the edge of psychology's traditional boundary. The authors and readers must be conversant (and competent) in the concepts and techniques of neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, biochemistry, pharmacology, genetics, evolution, or ethology, besides the traditional experimental psychology. Because the motivation of individuals to publish greatly exceeds resources for publishing, selection of papers is necessary. The selection procedures are not unique; the editor and associate editors send the manuscripts to experts in the field for advisory opinions. The paper must fit the mission of the journal, it must be technically sound, the conclusions derived compellingly from empirical data, and, finally, it must be interesting and significant, is fairley nonobjective, he cited frequently in future research. Significance is fairly nonobjective and judgmental; what is one person's significance is another person's trivia. I know of no solution to the problem of the “tyranny of editors,” but their terms are finite (at least with society journals) and most axe aware of the problem. They do not want to go down in history with the dubious distinction of having rejected Einstein's first paper on relativity theory (or the like). Most editors are sensitive to the problem of distinguishing significant novelty in science from mere incompetence."
"In the May 1973 issue of EOS, I criticized tendencies in earth science periodicals to discourage referee anonymity. I stressed that exposing referees to unnecessary personal and subjective influences tended to degrade standards of quality and promoted cliques, fragmentation, superspecialization, and proliferation of scientific literature. Generally speaking, division of opinion on this question, based on letters and personal contacts since 1973, has tended (with notable exceptions) to divide along two lines: the “wise old heads” favor anonymity, whereas many young idealists favor openness. Referees can help keep literature standards high (there is no evidence that they can or do thwart new ideas, determinedly pushed). but they can do little to stop literature proliferation, If individuals do scientific work, they may as well publish of not do it at all. The only real solutions to literature proliferation are fewer scientists or a drastic paper shortage, as experienced in Bulgaria."
"For the usual incremental process of discovery, a review system assures that papers accepted for publication meet agreeable standards and fit into current beliefs espoused by a given scientific community at a given time. The process encourages orthodoxy and discourages the publication of the unusual or disparate discovery. It tends to perpetuate the “mopping-up” operations which engage most scientists throughout their careers. Normal research results are cumulative and derive their success from the ability of scientists to select problems which can be solved with conceptual and instrumental techniques close to those already in existence. Unanticipated novelty emerges wrong. There is, however, no such thing as research without counter-instances. As a growing sense develops, often restricted to a narrow subdivision of the scientific community, that an existing concept or paradigm has ceased to function adequately, the review process encourages bifurcation and the establishment of new journals."
"The current journal publication system has four immediate participants: researcher-writers, publishers, libraries, and readers. In response to technological developments which facilitate copying, publishers have increased their demands for additional revenue from libraries. The logic of the publishes' arguments threatens the very existence of institutions which purchase items with the intention of providing them to more than one reader. Society at large does have some interest in the spread of scientific principles and technological information, and the current thrust of the publishers broadens the concept of the ownership of ideas, since publishers entitled to a new payment for each reader may have the right to price large segments (e.g. students, docturs caring for the inteligent, etc.) of an interested public out of the market. In addition, increased restriction on the flow of scientific and technical information may have a significant impact on the advance of science and technology itself."
"About 50 000 journals of significance for research are currently being published. No library, not even the largest, can afford to subscribe to more than a small fraction of the total needed by its readers. This forces the library to make a selection from among those published. The library's problem is which titles to select and how to provide its readers with access to those it cannot subscribe to. Publishers fear that access to journals by photocopy or on interlibrary loan will reduce their subscriptions. There is no evidence that libraries are not now subscribing to all of the journals they can afford or will not continue to do so. Any increase in the cost of providing access to those titles to which a library can not subscribe, or in the cost of journal subscriptions, can only further reduce the number of titles a library can buy. The only solutions are 1) cheaper forms of publication than the present conventional journal or 2) cheaper access to that which the library cannot afford."
"The nation's libraries are currently faced with severe budget problems. One of the more critical areas for the large academic research libraries is the acquisition of scientific journals. Faced with the requirement to reduce the number of journal titles to stay within budgets, many librarians are considering cooperative activities to share resources. At the same time the number of available current titles still appears to be increasing. The dilemma is basically how to spread reduced real dollars over an increasing number of titles competing for the funds. Based upon a recent study by the Association of Research Libraries, two alternative approaches for improving the access to periodical resources are examined. The two basic configurations are 1) a single new national facility with a comprehensive collection, and 2) a regional resource network based on designated existing library collections. After a brief description of the approaches, they are compared on the basis of estimated costs and satisfied demands. Additional noncost factors are included in the final decision for a single new national center."
"Scientific journals and libraries such as the Engineering Societies Library are truly working partners in the world of information, but expanded communications between the librarians and the editors of the journals can pay off, with considerable benefits accruing to both parties. Librarians should stop complaining to each other about the headaches to be encountered with journals and let the editors know, for example, that perforated pages ate anathema to them. Publishers and editors, on the other hand, can help libraries and information centers by, as a case in point, clearly indicating on the journal any irregularity, be it in numbering or periodicity. Librarians are fully aware of and sympathetic toward the monetary problems of journals because libraries have the same problems. As the librarian, with an essentially unchanged budget, examines a subscription agents' invoice that is up at least 20 percent, it hurts to have to decide what journals will be dropped."
"“Fair use” is at best inconclusive. It does not solve the two real problems: 1) the increasing need of education science, government, and business for multiple copies of documents; and 2) the fact that since the copyright owner's compensation is the total return from the use of his work, the loss through “fair use” of his work cannot be measured in terms of any individual use but only in terms of the total use and total copying. Therefore, we feel that the present provision for fair use, while making possible some types of research use of copyrighted material in computer and microfilm storage devices, cannot solve the “computer problem,” let alone the direct copying problem. At best, it will serve as a temporary safety valve for the user and eventually the courts, until some clearinghouse system is established. At that time, the concept of fair use should lose its importance and die off."
"Private industry scientists and engineers frequently require documents for contextual screening or direct use. Their information centers have long attempted to have most of the appropriate documents at hand, but the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of research and engineering has combined with soaring document costs to indicate clearly that this local goal will be decreasingly attainable. More photocopies, electronic copies, and translations (including those of copyrighted works) will therefore be required. Such ready document access is also vital to national goals because over 50 percent of even government-funded research and development is performed by private industry, Private industry information centers thus feel strongly that their users' needs must be included in any solutions to the “copyright problems.” What they are after, however, is a “fair access” that will still adequately fund vital publishers and information services through some mutually suitable payment system that are proportional to use."
"One professional in six is an information literate. He knows where and how to find what is known or knowable in his field. The function of the reference librarian who keeps track of our interests and saves items for our use needs to become an institutional part of all professional lives. Journal subscribers who find one article annually relevant to their work in their professional publication subscribe for that one article. Its value is more closely related to the cost of the subscription than to the cost of photocopying. A changed perception of the value of information is a basic element in the new economics of journal publishing flowing from the Senate mandated “workable licensing and clearance” procedures. A method for institutionalizing the sorting process characterized in the reference library as a method for increasing information literacy is a necessary corollary to such licensing and clearance procedures."
"As the literature of science has grown and as the editorial and production costs of publications have escalated, it has become mandatory to eliminate the duplication of intellectual effort, and if possible the mechanical effort, which today goes into the preparation and analysis of a scientific document. The primary journal is the true repository of the original scientific and technological data. The secondary service provides access to that originial data; it does not replace it; it is not a surrogate. Experiments to date include the exchange of abstracts, index entries, and uniform bibliographic citations; also, the simultaneous editorial processing of the primary manuscript and the required secondary records. In the latter example, it is possible to produce primary journal indexes automatically from the secondary service database and to plan for one-time keyboarding of specific input data needed by both services. Large computer composition systems developed for the needs of secondary services are now composing primary journals economically."
"The researcher is best served by high editorial standards and ready access, both in the primary journals and in the secondary publications needed for data retrieval and for literature reviews of specialized topics. Specialized periodicals that respond to a real need for consolidation of a particular field can be useful, but commercial pressures leading to unwanted publications and poorly edited articles waste both the time of investigators and the library budget of their institutions. The cost of publication and dissemination is small in proportion to the total expense of a research investigation, but research may nevertheless be impeded by library deletions arising through inadequate correlation of library and research budgets. High-quality periodicals, both primary and secondary, that do not recover part of their costs through page charges are particularly vulnerable in times of economic retrenchment and as a result of recent interpretations of copyright law. Proposals to reduce primary publications to printed summaries, with details available on request by photocopy or microfilm, do not serve the best interests of the researcher."
"As a primary publisher of scientific and technical material, we recently made a review of the current production and dissemination of information published in our journals, monographs, and books. The results of this pilot survey will be a factor determining whether we will continue to publish our material in its current format and whether this material can continue to be utilized throughout the secondary journal publishing field."
"Composition at the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) has progressed in 20 years from hot type to author prepared camera-ready copy, to IBM Executive typing, to math by hanger keys, to multilevel mathematics on the cathode-ray tube (CRT). ASCE's technical journals have incorporated each of these nonfederally subsidized innovations to deliver better, faster, lower cost final products in 13 journals that include about 13 000 pages per year and indexing of 5 000 articles, papers, and discussions per year from staff-typed optical-character-recognition (OCR) material prepared by an editor, half-time, and an editorial assistants Civil Engineering magazine, the biennial membership directory, and annual committee personnel listings are also computer composed."
"Typesetting of journals by computer still is more expensive today than typewriter composition. Economics favors the computer only if multiple use can be made of the material after it has been captured in machine-readable form. Such is the case with the material that is keyboarded into the bibliographic database of the American Institute of Physics (AIP). The records in tins database are produced directly from the manuscripts submitted by authors and are then used over and over again: to photocompose a part of the article in the primary journal itself, to photocompose pages for an “advance abstracts” publication, to photocompose selected abstracts needed by The Energy Research and Development Administration's (ERDA's) Nuclear Science Abstracts and to provide ERDA with a corresponding tape which eventually goes to the International Nuclear Information System in Vienna, to produce a monthly tape for information centers offering selective dissemination of information (SDI) and other services, to produce multiple entries in the new quarterly Current Physics Index which covers all the physics journals published by AIP, to produce multiple entries in the annual subject and author indexes in each journal, and to produce cumulative 5 to 20-year journal indexes. The multiple-use concept cannot be used to justify computer typesetting of the full text of journal articles. We will specify the conditions that must be met before full-text computer composition can become competitive with other methods, and discuss some of the advantages of such a system."
"Twelve years ago it became apparent to the management of the Mack Printing Company that technological improvements had to be made in the craft of composition. Continued reliance on the traditional high-labor-intensive monotype system would not be acceptable when considered in relation to the scientific and technical community. In this paper the evolution of cold-type composition to the present “state of the art” at Mack is traced. How the system functions and interacts with the journal publisher is shown, and the total systems approach outlining the hardware and the software development is explained. Also discussed are the objectives of Mack Pointing Company for future enhancements to the system and the ability of the present system to create a database for the generation of periodic indexes. Comparison and evaluation of this approach as it relates to economy, flexibility, speed, and quality of typesetting can readily be made."
"An applications program called TEXTCOMP has been developed by the Technical information and Documentation Division. Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), for use in conjunction with Alphanumeric Publication Systems' Comp-2 photocomposition program. TEXTCOMP, written in the Comp-2 language, is designed to accommodate the wide variety of complex page formats and other production requirements typically encountered in JPL's scientific and engineering documentation. This documentation ranges from straight textual narratives to exceedingly complex technical explanations and descriptions with significant amounts of displayed mathematics. Inherent in all displayed mathematics is an unlimited variety in alignments, horizontal and vertical spacing, and widths and heights of individual characters. Since the photocomposition system for which the TEXTCOMP applications program was written was not designed to perform automatically the intricate calculations required to accommodate these variations, the initial applicability of the program was limited largely to documentation without displayed mathematics. A coding approach has been developed whereby displayed mathematics can now be photocomposed in place within the text using the TEXTCOMP program. Although this coding approach was developed specifically for use with TEXTCOMP and Alphanumeric's Comp-2 photocomposition system, it is applicable for use with any photocomposition system. The approach described is simple, but unconventional; the codes are demanding, but easily manageable. The most attractive aspect is that absolutely no physical measurement of characters is required."
"With the widespread use of offset lithographic printing for scientific and technical journals, the publisher often gains a cost advantage by combining type and art copy on the page mechanical or repro proof. The art or illustrative copy takes the form of an intermediate print, whether the original is a line drawing or continuous-tone photograph. The complete page mechanical is then treated by the lithographer as a line shot, without the need for separate illustration negatives to be made and stripped into position within the page negative, or double burned on the plate. An economical method of manufacturing high-quality intermediate prints for both line and continuous-tone original art is explained. Suggestions are offered on how to set up an in-house camera operation with emphasis on equipment and staffing requirements. The economic and schedule advantages of an in-house camera operation are also discussed."
"A reader's most positive acceptance of a journal is usually expressed by his subscription renewal. Some readers are denied this opportunity to express their feelings about a journal if they receive it gratis as part of a membership in a society or organization. Whichever the case, it is the responsibility of the editor and publisher to meet the needs and expectations of their readers. A variety of techniques are used by editors and publishers to determine what the reader wants. The American Institute of Physics (AIP) has formed the AIP Publications Survey Panel. The Panel contains 3000 members and is a means of establishing regular communications between editors and a cress section of the readership of our journals. This paper examines the publication survey panel, the willingness of society members to participate, and the kinds of information wanted and received."
"Over the years, a great deal of attention has been paid to the cost of disseminating scientific and technical information. Unfortunately, a similar amount of effort has not been expended on determining the economic value of that information to the user. While Innumerable user preference surveys have been conducted, such surveys are notoriously useless in determining questions of price. For over a year now, the IEEE has been conducting an experiment aimed both at testing a selective dissemination system and, from the subscribe; behavior, determining the price elasticity of material presented via that system. Our initial data indicate that early adopters of such a system behave in a fashion analogous to that observed in early adopters of other technological innovations. Over approximately an 8-to-1 range, their price elasticity is essentially zero. Based on these early data, the program is being extended in order to determine price elasticity in an equilibrated system."

"Though surrounded by fascinating and challenging subjects, too many engineers and scientists write dull reports and papers. More attention to verbs can help alleviate dullness and can promote such qualities as vividness, directness, force, and interest. Passive verb forms can be changed to active; combinations of passive verbs with other lifeless verbs can be reduced through subordination and elimination; and normalized verbs (verbs forced into noun functions) can be used as true verbs. An improved approach to technical writing is suggested."
"Technical writers apparently show little concern with the measurement of readability, defined as level of reading comprehension. Some evidence and reasons for this indifference are presented. Three current methods of measuring readability are described. Two readability formulas involving word load and sentence load are the Dale-Chall, which uses a word-list, and the Fry, which uses a graph. The cloze procedure is a non-formula technique which involves the reader as well as the material being evaluated. The application of these methods is illustrated with passages of technical writing of varying difficulty. Some implications and applications of readability concepts are indicated."
"A method which sheds some light on the manner in which engineers draw or do not draw upon science is described. References in innovative engineering articles will reflect the degree to which the innovation draws upon engineering or science. Furthermore an examination of the citation network surrounding the innovation should reveal the closeness or distance of the science connection. To test out this idea one of the innovations described by Langrish (1972) `The Severn Bridge design' is selected for study."
  "Hyphenation programs used in computerized typesetting employ varied techniques-often in combination-to determine where to break the last word on a line. Usually, a dictionary lookup procedure is combined with a `logical hyphenation program' which bases its decisions on the recognition of certain characters, strings of characters, or patterns of vowels and consonants. The described program is such a logical routine. It is based on the word division rules of Webster's New International Dictionary and recognizes prefixes, suffixes, and other letter combinations which require special processing, including strings which are likely to belong to accented syllables."

"This paper describes a technique of generating terminological digests speedily on terminals connected to a computer in order to overcome these impediments and aid the translator in streamlining the translation production process. A terminological digest represents the glossarial framework of a translation, a unique dictionary constructed automatically for the text to be translated. The user can produce a terminological digest by invoking the appropriate program on his terminal, entering on the keyboard the terms he wishes to have looked up. All terms entered are immediately retrieved from an up-to-date scientific-technical dictionary and provided with target language equivalents and other pertinent information. At the user's option, the dictionary entries may be presented singly, as a list in the order of entering the terms (e.g., the order in which they occur in the text to be translated), or as an alphabetically-sorted list. These lists may be displayed, typed out, or printed and saved as `minidictionaries' for a particular field."
"Transitional devices fasten together words, ideas, and thoughts; and they enable particularly the expository writer to develop a cogent and coherent article that his reader can easily follow. This paper describes and then presents general guidelines for the effective usage of six types of transitional devices."
"`Why Johnny can't write?' (Newsweek, December 5, 1975) is answered by a Technical Johnny, whose rebuttal shows that he needs help rather than censure. Suggestions for improving such poorly literate writing are addressed to engineers, technicians, professional communicators, and engineering managers."
  "This panel is sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Group on Professional Communications. It is intended as an open discussion; we are restricting ourselves to technical composition and especially the problem of the composition of mathematics. I am going to ask each of our panelists to make a few statements about their views of “the problem.” When these are complete, we expect and hope that you will participate in the discussion. Today's objectives are to add (possibly) one more straw to the pile, in the hope that someone, somewhere, someday will be able to set a page of mathematics for $10 “as it used to be.”"
"Prospective authors are requested to submit new, unpublished manuscripts for inclusion in the upcoming event described in this call for papers."

"In this issue of PC TRANSACTIONS we have included, along with the new items, a number of reprints from previous issues."
"The author argues that more people should publish because it is in the best interest of the person, and of his company. The author acquires prestige, and sometimes remuneration. The company contributes to and draws on the vast store of knowledge it can not afford to duplicate on its own."
"The writing of scientists and engineers is severely criticized, but the critics seldom dig into the reasons for its supposed weaknesses and faults. By analyzing technical writing, however, one finds that many of the `faults' are justifiable if not carried to extremes, and if not used inappropriately when writing for nontechnical audiences."
"Analyzes the characteristics of the multiple-image technique of audiovisual communication and emphasizes its advantages over the more usual sequential presentation of supporting visual images. The features of the multiple-image technique are assessed and the production techniques peculiar to the method are examined. Audience reaction to this type of presentation is then considered. Evidence is presented to support the premise that this technique offers exciting potential for the presentation of technical papers, an area of communication which has received little attention for much too long a time."
"Recent questionnaire surveys of on-the-job engineers indicate that they want training in technical speech. The author suggests that courses in technical speech might be improved if teachers knew more about how technical speech differs from other kinds of speech, and more about the requirements for successful technical speaking. Research into matters of audience, delivery, and audiovisual aids can help to provide this needed information."
"The author argues that translation, whether literary or technical, is a creative art, not a mechanical process, and machines have failed to give useful translations of serious texts for this reason. The conventional distinctions between `literary' and `technical' translation are misleading and perhaps false. Literal or word-for-word translations are not translations at all and their use should be discouraged. Translation requires a full command of both languages and some understanding of the subject. Quality is difficult for a layman to judge, but idiomatic English (or whatever the target language is) is one good sign, and there are others."
"To find out if writing really does help establish a reputation, and why some technical professionals write and some don't, a questionnaire was distributed to a sampling of authors and non-authors at 19 IBM development laboratories and manufacturing plants in the US and Europe. Respondents were asked how many articles for professional journals and technical magazines, and how many conference papers they had written. The authors were then asked their principal reasons for writing; what, if any, benefits have come of it; and what they think are the relative advantages and disadvantages, to the author, of writing for journals, technical magazines and conferences. Non-authors in the sample were asked the principal reasons that have held them back from writing articles and papers. The results of this survey are presented."
"Since new business is the life blood of any successful company, the preparation of complete, accurate, and effective proposals is important to every engineer. A proposal for products or services acts as a company's on-the-spot silent salesman. The fact that several companies usually prepare competitive proposals for the same potential contract increases the importance of an effective presentation. Each proposal represents a formidable hurdle in the race for profits and survival. The purpose of this paper is to briefly outline what an effective proposal is and define the engineer's role in preparing one."
"Encyclopedic storage is a method of storing knowledge that avoids unnecessary duplication and provides convenient access to the stored materials. This paper discusses a particular approach to encyclopedic storage of scientific and technical information which can now be implemented. Motivation for this approach is developed here by considering first some of the basic properties of the process of knowledge transfer via the written record, leading to the development of a unit  of knowledge. In terms of this unit, the `size' of scientific and technical knowledge, and of electrical engineering knowledge is estimated. This unit also becomes the basic building block for the proposed encyclopedic system. A very small experimental version of such a system is now in existence."
"Two-hundred and seventy house journals considered research, development, or production aids to the engineer or scientist and published in the US, UK, and France are analyzed. Publication frequencies are given with quarterly being most common. Distribution patterns to customers, employees, educators, and librarians are described. These patterns vary, but customers receive the highest distribution. Journal content is examined in terms of signed and anonymous articles. Features such as abstracts, meeting notices, editorials, and advertisements are mentioned. Two features of particular interest are (1) comprehensive lists of articles and speeches of technical staff, and (2) reprinting of material already published in professional journals. The subject matter of individual journals is usually highly specialized."
 "The author suggests that with the large volumes of information available, our conventional indexing tools are already overloaded and that we are in danger of becoming information retrieval limited. Centralised repositories and better communications are discussed as one solution to this problem."
"Describes a computer program written for the UNIX time-sharing system which reduces by several orders of magnitude the task of finding words in a document which contain typographical errors. The program is adaptive in the sense that it uses statistics from the document itself for its analysis. In a first pass through the document, a table of diagram and trigram frequencies is prepared. The second pass through the document breaks out individual words and compares the diagrams and trigrams in each word with the frequencies from the table. An index is given to each word which reflects the hypothesis that the trigrams in the given word were produced from the same source that produced the trigram table. The words are sorted in decreasing order of their indices and printed. Printing is suppressed for words appearing in a table of 2726 common technical English words."
  "These recommended practices provide direction for establishing procedures that will yield data which verify that the class 1E equipment can meet its performance requirements during and following on SSE (safe shutdown earthquake) preceded by a number of OBEs (operating basis earthquakes). This document maybe used by equipment manufactures to establish procedures that will yield data to substantiate performance claims or by equipment users to evaluate and verify performance of representative devices and assemblies as part of an overall qualification effort."
"We describe a new technique for optical-fiber cable connecting and splicing. Preliminary tests with multimode fibers produced splices with an average loss of less than 0.1 dB and a peak loss of 0.18 dB."
"The well-known coupled-mode theory of waveguides is extended to include dielectric guides made of anisotropic materials. Exact coupled-wave equations for anisotropic dielectric waveguides are derived, and explicit expressions for the coupling coefficients are given. The coupling coefficients for isotropic waveguides are obtained as a special case. A simple approximation for the coupling coefficients in the case of slight anisotropy and slight departure from an ideal waveguide is presented."
"Apparent changes in the coercivity and remanence of the magnetic reed material used in the remreed sealed contact were encountered during the glass-to-metal sealing operation. By using primarily metallographic observations correlated with magnetic data, it was determined that these changes were due to a modification of the 600°C-aged microstructure caused by the time/temperature cycle experienced in sealing. The room-temperature stable precipitates that are developed by the 600°C anneal to produce magnetic hardening are dissolved, and the alloy converts to a two-phase duplex body-centered cubic (BCC) microstructure along one-half to two-thirds of the reed shank. This produces a substantial increase in coercive force and some decrease in remanence. The structure and properties of the alloy before sealing have little influence on the reaction."
"A multibeam antenna for satellite communication affords reuse of frequency allocations and flexibility in traffic routing. A multibeam satellite antenna is described that employs a spheroidal reflector in a compact periscope design. The aperture is 1.5 meters in diameter radiating six beams in the 20- and 30-GHz satellite frequency bands. Electrical measurements indicate that this antenna is suitable for multibeam satellite use."
"This paper gives solutions for multilayer dielectrics that yield polarization-independent operation at a given angle of incidence and at a given frequency. An exhaustive analysis is given for symmetric three-layer dielectrics surrounded by the same medium. Special solutions are also given for symmetric multilayer dielectrics with more than three layers surrounded by the same medium and for multilayer dielectrics surrounded by different media. Rules are presented for obtaining new polarization-independent solutions by cascading given solutions. Finally, for the purpose of demonstration and comparison of various solutions, different design examples are carried out for polarization-independent 3-dB beam splitters to operate at millimeter wavelengths."
"An engineering method is proposed for calculating rain attenuation distributions for frequencies greater than 10 GHz and for paths of arbitrary length. The technique is based upon the observed approximate lognormality of rain attenuation and rain rate statistics within the range of interest; it reflects local meteorology through incorporation of the observed point rain rate distribution. Some important parameters in the resulting formulas are determined empirically from experimental data. Sample calculated results agree well with available experimental data from Georgia, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. This new technique may prove useful for engineering radio paths at frequencies above 10 GHz. Sample calculations of expected outage probability are given for 11- and 18-GHz radio links at Atlanta, Georgia, as a function of repeater spacing and transmission polarization."
"Effective analyses of performance for detection schemes that optimally decode digital data in the presence of intersymbol interference have been slow in coming. Recently, however, Forney has given an upper bound on the bit error probability for maximum-likelihood sequence estimation. Starting from a standard geometrical framework, we give a much simplified derivation of this upper bound. Our derivation places the validity of this important bound more in evidence in that the concepts of whitened matched filter and error event are not introduced."
"We present the power spectrum of a sinusoidal carrier, frequency modulated by a random baseband pulse train in which the signaling-pulse duration is finite and the signal pulses may overlap and have different shapes. Symbols transmitted during different time slots are assumed to be statistically independent and identically distributed. The spectral density appears as a Hermitian form suitable for numerical computation by a digital computer. Simple conditions in terms of the modulation parameters are given under which discrete spectral lines are present in the spectrum. Several examples are given to illustrate the method."
"This paper presents models for the behavior of trunk groups containing short-holding-time faulty trunks. The models, referred to as ordered selection, two-sided selection, random selection, or queuing selection, are applicable to selection procedures used by a number of switching systems. Each model is analyzed to obtain the fraction of group attempts carried on a faulty trunk in the group, and the corresponding fraction of group attempts that find all trunks busy (blocking or overflow). Numerical results for the basic models are also presented. The results indicate that factors such as the trunk selection procedure or the type of group (high usage or final) can lead to significant differences in the performance of a group containing a faulty trunk."
"Linear predictive coding is an efficient method for transmitting the amplitudes of moving-area picture elements (pels) in a conditional replenishment coder for video-telephone signals. It has been conjectured that if the linear predictor can dynamically adapt to the speed and direction of motion in the scene, then greatly improved performance should result. To test this conjecture and to get a first-order estimate of the possible saving, computer simulations were carried out using pairs of video-telephone frames stored on digital discs. Using this data, picture quality could not be studied. However, differential signal entropies could be estimated, and this was done for several nonadaptive and adaptive linear predictors. Entropies (in bits per moving-area pel) for adaptive linear predictors were significantly lower than for nonadaptive predictors, indicating that substantial bit-rate savings should be possible. However, simpler implementations will have to be devised before adaptive prediction becomes practicable."
 "We study the excitation of a parabolic-index fiber by an incoherent source. The theory is based on approximating the fiber modes by Laguerregaussian functions. The dependence of the total light power injected into the fiber core on the separation between source and fiber, and on the transverse displacement of the source, is shown in graphic form. Also shown are far-field radiation patterns, which indicate the distribution of power versus mode number, for several launching conditions and plots of power versus azimuthal mode number for given values of the compound mode number. The study of launching efficiency versus source radius leads to prescriptions for optimizing the ratio of source to fiber core radius without a matching lens. Use of a lens for matching the image of a small source to the size of the fiber core increases the launching efficiency relative to the power consumption of the light-emitting-source diode."
"Lossy plastic coatings are used as a means of providing mechanical protection for optical fibers during the optical-cable manufacturing process. A model utilizing a quasi-ray analysis has been developed in this paper to determine the effects of lossy coatings on the transmission energy in a multimoded step-index optical fiber. Cladding thickness is the dominant fiber parameter that plays a critical role in preventing transmission loss due to a lossy coating. Other parameters that significantly affect transmission loss are transmitting wavelength, the real and imaginary part of the refractive index of the lossy coating, and the fiber core diameter."
"A technique has been developed that is potentially suitable for field-splicing an optical cable containing linear arrays of optical fibers. Linear arrays of fibers (which may reside in fiber ribbons) are placed between spacers that are grooved top and bottom to form stacked, rectangular arrays. This operation can be done without microscopes or micromanipulators. After potting, the ends of the two stacked arrays are polished to form cable terminations that are brought together in a butt joint splice. A 12 × 12 array using this technique exhibited a mean loss of 0.42 dB for 138 splices with 70 percent of the losses less than 0.5 dB. Subsequent single ribbon-to-ribbon splices had average losses less than 0.2 dB. Launching conditions can be duplicated and splice losses are repeatably low for reassembled splices; this presumably is due to polished fiber ends and accurate alignment. Experience gained thus far indicates that this mass splicing method will probably produce large array splices with a maximum loss of 0.5 dB."
"In using digital speech for mobile radio, we encounter the problem of severe bit-error bursts. Error clustering occurs because the bit duration is typically much smaller than that of a signal “fade,” and average bit-error probabilities greater than 1 percent are not uncommon. For speech communication over such channels, this paper proposes variable step-size differential coders based on explicit (and error-protected) transmission of quantizer step size. Specifically, we discuss delta and dpcm coders to be referred to as dm-aqf and dpcm-aqf, where aqf stands for adaptive quantization with forward estimation (and transmission) of step size. (Backward estimation, based on quantized-signal history, has the nice feature that the step-size information does not have to be explicitly transmitted. Furthermore, obtaining this information does not entail any encoding delay. However, due to the dependence of step size on reconstructed signal history, backward estimation is often less reliable in the presence of bit errors than a scheme based on aqf.) The studies reported in this paper cover the problem of step-size determination in aqf, the design of time-invariant first-order predictors for dpcm-aqf, and the performances of aqf encoders with and without burst-error-protecting ploys such as redundant time-diversity coding and bit scrambling. Judging from snr figures and informal listening tests, interesting results are obtained with the following 48-kb/s coders: three-bit dpcm-aqf with redundant error protection, and dm-aqf using bit scrambling."
"This paper proposes a new approach to signal selection in time-diversity systems. Specifically, we consider the problem of digital speech transmission over a burst-error channel using two-channel time-diversity reception. Let every speech segment (of length W) be transmitted twice so that at least one of the transmissions escapes an error burst, with a certain useful probability. Let the received speech segments be Y1 and Y2. We propose an autocorrelation-maximizing signal selection procedure of the following form. Select Y1 (or Y2) as the “cleaner” speech segment according as C(Y1, W) ≧ (or <) C(Y2, W), where $ C(Y_u,W)=\\sum_{r=2}^W({\\rm sgn}\\ Y_{ur}\\cdot{\\rm sgn}\\ Y_{u(r-1)})/(W-1);u=1,2.$ Yuτ is the speech amplitude at sample τ in Yu, W is a computational window that is typically a few milliseconds long, and sgn Yuτ is a polarity function that is assumed to have zero mean and unit variance. The use of sgn Yuτ instead of Yuτ leads to a simply implemented selection procedure, and computer simulations have demonstrated its practical utility. For example, in one study of three-bit dpcm coding, autocorrelation-based burst-error detection proved to be more useful than a procedure where dpcm samples were error-protected on a bit-by-bit basis, rather than in blocks."
"In this paper, the performance limits, as given by the signal-to-noise ratio (s/n), are described for different speech-encoding schemes including adaptive quantization and (linear) adaptive prediction schemes. The comparison is made on the basis of computer simulations using 8-kHz-sampled speech signals of one speaker. Different bit rates (two bits per sample–five bits per sample) have been used. A three-bit-per-sample pcm scheme with a nonadaptive μ100 quantizer leads to an s/n value of approximately 9 dB. A maximum s/n value of approximately 25 dB has been reached using an encoding scheme including both adaptive quantization and adaptive prediction. Entropy coding of the quantizer output symbols leads to an additional gain in s/n of nearly 3 dB."
"The signal-to-noise ratios of different speech-encoding schemes have been measured in the case where the channel contains errors. Those types and probabilities of errors have been considered that are of interest for mobile telephone applications. Most encoding schemes use an adaptive three-bit quantizer with an explicit transmission of the step-size information. A scheme with an adaptive prediction algorithm has also been studied. It has been assumed in all cases that the side information about the quantizer step size and the predictor coefficients is transmitted in an error-protected format. Measurements were made by simulating the coding schemes and the noisy channel on a digital computer. The results include upper bounds of the improvements that can be reached with error protection of the most significant bits."
"For the single-server queue with renewal input, we obtain heavy traffic approximations for the time-dependent distributions of queue length and virtual delay by constructing approximating diffusion processes. These approximations are shown to agree with known limiting cases, and a comparison is made with results from a computer simulation."
"Many important properties of switching networks can be effectively studied in the more general context of graph theory. In particular, the various rearrangeability properties of a network fall into this category. If G is a graph with vertex set V = I ∪ Ω, we say G is rearrangeable if, for all choices of distinct vertices, i1, i2, …, i1 in I and j1, j2, …, j1 in Ω, there exist vertex disjoint paths between ik and jk for all k. In this paper, we determine the minimum number of edges any rearrangeable graph may have for all choices of I and Ω. We also discuss generalizations in which V is strictly greater than I ∪ Ω and/or t is bounded by a predetermined value. The minimal rearrangeable graphs we construct can be used to form efficient rearrangeable (and nearly rearrangeable) switching networks of arbitrary size."
 "We study the numerical solution of a nonlinear, partial-differential equation that describes charge transport in a model of a charge-coupled device (ccd). This model differs from previous models in that field-aiding of the transfer is taken into account. Although a derivation of the transport equation is given, the main emphasis in the paper is on the numerical techniques involved, and no actual numbers are presented. Actual numerical results based on the techniques developed here can be found in several recent design studies. The equation, which is parabolic, has one space dimension and one time dimension. Galerkin's method, with standard chapeau functions, is used to discretize in space. This results in a very stiff system of nonlinear, ordinary, differential equations. To solve these equations, we use a first-order backward Euler scheme coupled with extrapolation. A number of alternative schemes were tried and found to be inadequate."
"A double-insulator structure consisting of 500 Å of vapor-deposited Al2O2 and 1000 Å of thermally grown SiO2 is used as the gate dielectric in a beam-lead-compatible, p-channel, MOSFET, silicon-integrated-circuit technology. The Al2O3 layer, in addition to serving as a sodium barrier and thereby providing a self-passivated technology, results in a positive flatband voltage shift when compared to an SiO2 structure. The mechanism for this flatband voltage shift is the subject of this paper. The major experimental results obtained are (i) a negative charge exists near the Al2O2/SiO2 interface, its magnitude being independent of the Al2O3 thickness but inversely proportional to the SiO2 thickness, (ii) the magnitude of the SiO2/Si interface charge is inversely proportional to the SiO2 thickness, and (iii) a potential jump of about 1.25 volts in flatband voltage is associated with the addition of the Al2O3 layer. A physical model is proposed which assumes the existence of a constant voltage drop across the SiO2 layer during the Al2O3 deposition and a corresponding charge buildup at the SiO2/Al2O3 interface."
"A 1-watt impatt diode amplifier has been developed for short-haul FM radio relay applications in the 6-GHz common-carrier band. The amplifier is used in the new tm-2 system and as part of a retrofit package to upgrade the performance of the existing tm-1 system. Amplification is provided by a single silicon impatt diode which is used in an injection-locked mode. A finned heat sink provides impatt diode cooling by natural air convection within the radio bay. The diode is expected to have a mean life greater than 10 years, and it can be replaced in the field without the use of special tools or equipment. This microwave-integrated amplifier contains the rf samplers and detectors necessary to monitor both input and output rf power levels. The input power monitor also provides an input to a power-supply squelch circuit that removes dc power from the impatt diode if the rf input signal level becomes too low for adequate performance. The influence of the system requirements upon the amplifier design is described, and data on system performance are presented."
"Line-of-sight paths are important as VHF radio channels. In a mobile radio system, for example, the landscape determines the communication possibilities in a complicated way. This paper analyzes a simple model of rough terrain to relate statistical terrain properties to line-of-sight paths. The model is constructed from conical hills, all the same height, distributed at random over the surface of a spherical earth. The parameters of the model are the earth's radius a, the density σ of hills, and the grade g of the hills. Although a simpler planar model is obtained by letting a → ∞, a finite spherical earth is needed for most questions. Assuming that a base station is located at the peak of a hill, the most interesting line-of-sight paths are those from a typical hilltop. A large number of statistics of these paths are then derived, usually as simple functions of a, σ, and g. These include properties of paths to other peaks, to the horizon, and to random points on the ground."
"Two computer-aided algorithms for the design of all-pass digital filters are presented. The first technique is based on a linear programming approach to solving the approximation problem posed by the minimax design of an all-pass digital filter. A new iterative algorithm with stability constraints is offered for direct form design. The second technique implements a gradient search for those quadratic factors of an all-pass transfer function that lead to a locally optimal approximation (in the least-squares sense) of a desired phase function. New initial guess procedures and the parameterization of linear-phase offset enhance the least-squares design procedure. Examples illustrating the result of both procedures are included."
"The effect of small, periodic phase errors upon transmission between two coaxial, circularly symmetric apertures is considered when the aperture phase distributions are confocal and the amplitude distributions are gaussian. The results are applicable to loss calculations in beam waveguide systems with imperfect lenses. When the periods of the phase errors are less than one-half the aperture radii, the total loss is approximately 1/2(β21 + β22), where β1, β2 are the peak phase errors (in radians) on the apertures. Phase errors with periods greater than the aperture diameters are found to cause comparatively little transmission loss."
"Methods from group theory and combinatorics are used to prove the (Slepian-Duguid) rearrangeability theorem for Clos' three-stage network. The nr-permutations realizable in such a network can be represented as a product Gϕ −1H ϕG, where G, H are subgroups realized by stages and ϕ is the special cross–connect field used in making frames. Thus, rearrange-ability can be cast as Gϕ−1H ϕG = Snr = symmetric group of degree nr. Since it is an elementary theorem that a permutation group containing all transpositions is symmetric, it is enough to show that the product Gϕ−1H ϕG is closed under multiplication and contains all transpositions. We prove that closure of the product is equivalent to a property of suitable partitions: existence of systems of common representatives. This property, formulated by J. B. Kruskal, is a consequence of Hall's theorem on distinct representatives. It is easily seen that Gϕ−1H ϕG contains all transpositions, so the Slepian-Duguid theorem follows."
 "This paper presents an overview of the Digital Data System. The services to be provided are described and the premises for establishing both service and system objectives are discussed. The network concept, planning for its growth and administration, and a description of the network elements are presented as an introduction to the detailed papers which follow."
"The utilitarian aspect of the Digital Data System is discussed with emphasis on performance objectives that will be important when data communications is inserted into a system of data processing. Objectives for the dependability and quality of data communications are quantified and evaluated in terms of their impact on data processing. Characteristics of the several types of channels available are described in detail along with operational features of particular importance at the interface between data communication and data processing."
"Reliability and maintainability are important aspects of the service objectives for the Digital Data System. Consequently, maintenance planning was an essential element in the DDS development. Maintenance features provided by the system include in-service performance monitoring, protection switching, comprehensive alarms, and the means for rapid fault isolation and repair."
"Network design methods are described which determine the multiplexing and digital transmission facilities required to serve a given data-circuit demand. The long-haul network design is based on the definition of a three-level network routing hierarchy, the derivation of intercity bit-stream requirements, and a technique for selecting digital transmission facilities to carry the bit streams. The distribution network design within metropolitan areas makes use of different multiplexing combinations best suited to anticipated demands and techniques for using short-haul digital facilities in an efficient manner."
"The Digital Data System is synchronized by means of a network in the form of a master-slave tree. Functioning data links are used for distribution of synchronization signals and timing is recovered from the data stream. The master timing supply sets the frequency for the entire network. Each major node contains a nodal timing supply with an extremely long time constant, which phase-locks to the incoming data signal. The nodal timing supply contains frequency memory and sufficient accuracy to free run satisfactorily for several days if its inputs fail. A local or secondary timing supply is designed for operation in distant nodes of the tree. Each timing supply provides common clock signals to all DDS equipment in the office in which it is installed. All timing supply designs include a high degree of redundancy for reliability purposes."
"The two-stage multiplexing hierarchy developed for the Digital Data System is described. Included in this hierarchy are three synchronous time-division multiplexers and a new 64-kb/s cross-connect arrangement that offer both flexibility and simplified administrative procedures. Maintenance for the multiplexers is provided on an in-service monitoring basis and includes automatic switching of a “hot” spare in the event a fault is detected."
"The local distribution portion of the Digital Data System is discussed in this paper. Baseband, bipolar transmission over telephone cable pairs is used to extend the digital channel from the serving central office to the customer's location. The performance and requirements of these local channels are presented. The design and performance of the local distribution hardware are examined. Design features include (i) automatic equalization by means of an automatic line-build-out network and (ii) control mode indication by means of bipolar format violations."
"The mechanical design of equipment required to build the Digital Data System is described. Economic and technical constraints influencing partitioning, electrical interconnection, and styling are related. An overview is given of the hardware used for terminating loops, multiplexing data streams, and testing for system performance."
 "Since its formation in January 1925, Bell Laboratories has taken over the central role or scientific research and technical development from its predecessors in the Bell System. The pages of The Bell System Technical Journal have reflected a steady flow of Bell Laboratories technological contributions over the intervening years (see “Fifty Years of B.S.T.J.” in the July-August 1972 issue). It is, therefore, particularly fitting that we give some recognition to this half-century anniversary of Bell Laboratories."
"The variations in the geometry of a step-index optical fiber are determined as functions of position along the axis of the fiber by an analysis of the backscattered light produced when a beam from a cw laser is incident perpendicular to the fiber axis. The power spectrum computed from this distortion function is then utilized with coupled-mode theory to predict the mode coupling, the reduction in pulse dispersion, and the accompanying increased radiation loss of the fiber. The theoretical calculations support experimental observations and account for a partial reduction in the multimode pulse dispersion."
"A model based on frustrated total reflection of waves in a multilayered medium has been developed to analyze the crosstalk between multimode optical fibers. Kappa (κ), the parameter indicating the power distribution among the modes of the fiber, and fiber cladding thickness play very important roles in determining the crosstalk isolation between fibers. Significant but less dominant effects on crosstalk are due to variations in fiber numerical aperture, length, and transmitting wavelength."
"In this paper, the time-dependent coupled-power equations originally derived by Marcuse from intuitive arguments are rederived two ways, one using the coupled-line equations with perturbation theory and the other using the Kronecker product approach of Rowe and Young."
"The space-charge capacitance of the forward-biased junction has been found to play a major role in (i) the apparent rise time of the emission from small-area, high-radiance led's and (ii) the apparent turn-on delay of stripe-geometry dh-structure laser diodes. For a zero-bias capacitance of 200 pF, a typical value for such devices made by oxide-masking techniques, the measured rise time of an led that is fully turned on and the turn-on delay time of injection lasers may be as much as twice the limitation imposed by the spontaneous carrier recombination time. A proposed method to reduce these delays by preshaping the driving pulse is analyzed, and a reduction of the delay by a factor of 2 or better is predicted. These results are in agreement with experiments."
"A high-performance, depletion-load, bipolar-igfet technology is described. The optimization of device and circuit parameters, the ion-implanted depletion-load fabrication process, and the high-speed input and output circuits, which allow direct interface with the ttl circuit family, are discussed."
"This paper describes an implementation of a speaker-independent digit-recognition system. The digit classification scheme is based on segmenting the unknown word into three regions and then making categorical judgments as to which of six broad acoustic classes each segment falls into. The measurements made on the speech waveform include energy, zero crossings, two-pole linear predictive coding analysis, and normalized error of the linear predictive coding analysis. A formal evaluation of the systems showed an error rate of 2.7 percent for a carefully controlled recording environment and a 5.6 percent error rate for on-line recordings in a noisy computer room."
"Vertically separated antennas are recommended to increase the transmission availability of line-of-sight microwave links by reducing the duration and frequency of multipath fading events. The emphasis is on application to the 4- and 6-GHz bands on links with negligible ground reflections. Necessary signal processing, links utilizing passive repeaters (reflectors), and overwater links are also treated. Some new experimental data are presented."
"A new, generalized mean-square algorithm is presented to adjust the tape of a transversal adaptive equalizer. Any knowledge of the channel or the signaling format can be taken into account and will speed up the convergence process. The main applications are seen in partial-response signaling, where the new algorithm eliminates the interaction between the individual tap increments. This is achieved by decorrelating the components of the gradient in a fixed weighting matrix prior to the adjustments. Convergence is then extremely fast. If the channel has only phase distortion, a single iteration is sufficient to obtain the optimum tap vector (for any timing and carrier phase). This is verified by computer simulations. Finally, the new equalizer is compared with another structure recently proposed, and some advantages of the new system with regard to implementation and flexibility are pointed out."
"The numerical evaluation of slowly convergent integrals with infinite limits and regularly oscillating analytic integrands is discussed. Functions are presented that can be subtracted from the integrands to increase the rate of convergence. One of the integrals used as an example is an often-studied Fourier integral related to the power spectrum of a phase-modulated wave. It is pointed out that, when Fourier integrals whose values are known to be positive, e.g., probability densities, are evaluated by the trapezoidal rule, the values given by the trapezoidal rule are never less than the true values."
"An experiment was designed to determine the effect of rainfall upon the attenuation and polarization of millimeter waves. Vertically polarized waves at 60 GHz were transmitted over a 1-km path, and the energy received in both the vertical and horizontal polarizations, as affected by rain, was detected and recorded at the receiving site; similarly, a horizontally polarized wave was transmitted and the same components measured. Data were collected over a period of one year (1970) using an all-solid-state measuring set. It was found that attenuation due to rain exceeded 42 dB for 5 minutes, and that a system employing orthogonally polarized signals would have had to tolerate signal-to-crosstalk ratios as poor as 22 dB for that same period of time."
"The potential interference caused by scattering from raindrops is viewed as foreground reflections that “spoil” the off-beam antenna pattern. This approach greatly simplifies interference calculations and is sufficiently accurate for most engineering purposes. The principal uncertainty that limits not only this simplified approach but also the “exact” solution is the inability to characterize the variable rainfall distribution along any given radio path by a single parameter, such as the rainfall rate, either at a point or as an average along the path."
"A digital equalizer for data transmission linearly combines a sequence of samples [b(r + kt), k = 0, ± 1, ···] of the received data wave to mitigate the effects of intersymbol interference and noise. A natural question is, How will the performance of such a system depend on the timing phase τ, 0 ≦ τ ≦ T? We examine this problem in considerable detail for an infinite equalizer using a mean-square measure of performance. Excess bandwidth results in a significant difference in performance between the best and worst timing phase. Under practical noise conditions, it is estimated that the excess bandwidth must be down to 1 or 2 percent before the timing effect becomes insignificant. With a 10-percent roll-off, a 3-dB penalty can be incurred by choosing a bad timing epoch. Our main result is that under conditions likely to be encountered on channels similar to voiceband telephone channels, the optimum sampling instants will be accurately approximated by the consecutive maxima and minima of the sine wave that result when an alternating sequence of positive and negative pulses (dotting sequence) is transmitted. There are no additional local minima of the minimum mean-square error as the timing phase is varied."
  "We consider the situation in which digital data is to be reliably transmitted over a discrete, memoryless channel (dmc) that is subjected to a wire-tap at the receiver. We assume that the wire-tapper views the channel output via a second dmc). Encoding by the transmitter and decoding by the receiver are permitted. However, the code books used in these operations are assumed to be known by the wire-tapper. The designer attempts to build the encoder-decoder in such a way as to maximize the transmission rate R, and the equivocation d of the data as seen by the wire-tapper. In this paper, we find the trade-off curve between R and d, assuming essentially perfect (“error-free”) transmission. In particular, if d is equal to Hs, the entropy of the data source, then we consider that the transmission is accomplished in perfect secrecy. Our results imply that there exists a Cs > 0, such that reliable transmission at rates up to Cs is possible in approximately perfect secrecy."
"We report on optimum direct detection of digital data signals that are transmitted over optical fibers. Direct detection is provided by a photodetector whose output current is modeled as a noisy filtered Poisson stream of pulses. In this model, the time-varying pulse arrival rate is proportional to a linearly distorted version of the modulating signal. We show how the photodetector output is processed to derive the minimum probability-of-error receiver. Special attention is given to certain practical limiting cases. When the average energy in the response of the photodetector to an individual photon is small compared to the additive thermal noise, the optimum detector is shown to be linear except for the use of precomputed bias terms. At the other extreme are the photomultiplier and the avalanche photodiode where the average energy in the response of the photodetector to a single photon is large compared with the additive noise. In this situation, we show that the optimum detector estimates the photon arrival times and then uses these estimates in a weighted counter. In both limiting cases, the detectors are specialized to one-shot M-ary and synchronous multilevel pulse-amplitude modulated (pam) signals with intersymbol interference. For pam signaling, we demonstrate that finite system memory allows application of dynamic programming to provide a detector implementation whose computational complexity does not increase with time."
"We evaluate the crosstalk between adjacent cores in an optical fiber that results from electromagnetic coupling. Means of reducing it are discussed. We find that a 0.5-μm-thick layer of silver can, in principle, reduce the crosstalk from −20 to −130 dB without significant increase of the loss. These theoretical results are obtained for two identical single-mode dielectric slabs. In reality, the slabs are not rigorously identical. Longitudinal fluctuations of slab thickness reduce the crosstalk by at least 40 dB. The slab spacing can accordingly be reduced from, typically, 11 to 6 μm for a constant crosstalk. If the slabs are made dissimilar with a relative difference in thickness of 10 percent, the spacing can be reduced further, to approximately 1.5 times the slab thickness. For example, a 15-μm spacing is required between single-mode dissimilar slabs if the nominal slab thickness is 10 μm, provided scattering can be neglected."
"The degradation suffered when pulses satisfying the Nyguist criterion are used to transmit binary data in noise at supraconventional rates is studied. Optimum processing of the received waveforms is assumed, and attention is focused on the minimum distance between signal points as a performance criterion. An upper bound on this distance is given as a function of signaling speed. In particular, the pulse energy seems to be the minimum distance up to rates of transmission 25 percent faster than the Nyguist rate, but not beyond. Some mathematical aspects related to the above problem are also considered. In particular, the minimum distance is rigorously shown to be nonzero for all transmission rates. This is tantamount to showing that, in the singular case of linear prediction, perfect prediction cannot be approached with bounded prediction coefficients."
"An estimate of optimum performance is derived for a single-integration, adaptive delta modulator. Several simulations of adaptive delta modulators with single integrators have all produced signal-to-noise ratios near or below the estimate. The derivations presented here indicate that the performance of a single-integration delta modulator is dependent on the correlation between adjacent samples of the input signal and on the probability density function of its derivative. The relationship between the probability density of the derivative of the input signal and optimum performance, in turn, explains why signal-to-noise ratios taken on sine waves are greater than those recorded while processing speech signals."
"It has been suggested that customers for videotelephone service may be more interested in graphical information and in views of stationary objects than in head-and-shoulder views of people engaged in conversation. For this reason, an interframe coder simulation was constructed of a system that transmits graphics with full seven-bit pcm resolution, but displays scenes containing much movement with visible smearing in the moving areas. With the coder operating at 200 kb/s (0.1 bit per pel for a 1-MHz signal), a very usable (somewhat reduced-resolution) graphics picture can be transmitted in about one-half second, which is about as fast as the human eye can assimilate the information. A full-resolution picture is built up after 3 to 5 seconds but, except for high-detail scenes, it is very difficult to tell the difference between the half-second picture and the 5-second picture. Head-and-shoulder views of people engaged in low-key conversations are transmitted with quite adequate picture quality. Moving lips appear somewhat smeared, but it may not be enough to be objectionable if the audio is suitably delayed. However, large area movement is very visibly smeared–even to the point of being unrecognizable at moderate speeds. Whether or not this feature makes the coder unusable depends upon the value the user places on high-quality animated face-to-face conversation. Briefly, the coder works as follows: First, the signal is temporally prefiltered. Then moving-area peals are sent as line-to-line differences of frame-to-frame differences. As the buffer fills, field-to-field, pel-to-pel, and frame-to-frame subsampling as well as adaptive quantization are brought in as needed to reduce the data rate."
"A novel technique is presented for implementing a variable digital phase shifter which is capable of realizing noninteger delays. The theory behind the technique is based on the idea of first interpolating the signal to a high sampling rate, then using an integer delay, and finally decimating the signal back to the original sampling rate. Efficient methods for performing these processes are discussed in this paper. In particular, it is shown that the digital phase shifter can be implemented by means of a simple convolution at the sampling rate of the original signal."
 "Closed-form expressions are obtained for the impulse response of graded-index fibers whose relative permittivity is a homogeneous function of the two transverse coordinates x, y, and for the impulse width in graded-index fibers whose profile departs slightly, but otherwise arbitrarily, from a square law. The inhomogeneous dispersion of the material is taken into account. Pulse broadening can be reduced by a factor of 12 from the value obtained for square-law fibers. Simple expressions are found for the acceptance of highly oversized fibers."
"A comparison of the available data on environmental radiation and on the radiation damage in fibers and glasses under controlled laboratory conditions leads us to the conclusion that long-term exposure to gamma rays and neutrons in the environment does not pose a serious problem for the optical fibers."
"A technique for splicing optical fibers has been developed that uses a self-aligning square cross-section tube, with inner dimensions slightly larger than the optical fiber. A total loss of 0.58 dB was obtained for eight splices connected in series using a graded-index fiber with a 68-µm core diameter. The splices were made one at a time without the use of microscopes or micromanipulators; however, the fabrication process could be mechanized and extended to groups of fibers. A holding fixture could be added to adapt this technique to a connect-disconnect type splice. The size of the splice is presently 0.012 in. square, making it suitable for use within cables. Measurement set refinements that were needed to measure individual splice losses as low as 0.05 dB include an improved detector and means for better control of launching conditions."
"Multipair cables are carefully constructed to control the coupling between wire pairs to prevent excessive crosstalk. Several types of coupling modes exist between pairs, but the principal effort is devoted to controlling the “metallic-to-metallic” coupling mode because the coupling loss in this path is the most important in ordinary telephonic use of the cable. Over a half-century ago, Campbell showed that crosstalk behavior of this mode could be characterized by measuring a simple function called capacitance unbalance. This paper shows that at voice frequencies the crosstalk characteristics of the “longitudinal-to-metallic” mode can be predicted by measuring a second similar function of the same parameters that are contained in the capacitance unbalance. With the aid of these two functions, it is shown how the longitudinal balance of terminal equipment connected to a cable pair affects crosstalk. It is further shown that a longitudinal balance of approximately 40 dB or more is necessary for any station or terminal equipment used in the telephone network so that it will not significantly increase the small amounts of crosstalk inherent in the careful cable design. Also, a limitation is established for the maximum longitudinal voltages at voice frequency that can be applied without noticeably increasing crosstalk and noise in other cable pairs. This limitation is approximately 40 dB more restrictive than the tariff limitations for metallic voltages."
"Multiloop feedback has heretofore been ignored as a means of obtaining shaped gain amplifiers. In this paper, a theoretical basis is developed for using dual major loop feedback amplifiers to obtain shaped power gain with input and output reflection coefficient constraints. From the theoretical results, practical design procedures can easily be developed and one such procedure is discussed. The aim of this study was an alternative to the “brute force” termination technique of realizing input and output impedance matches. The development is otherwise unique in that it uses no hybrid transformers for beta circuit coupling or for realization of the reflection coefficient constraints."
"The load carried by a queuing system under equilibrium conditions is the average amount of server usage per unit of time. In telephony, this parameter is often evaluated by recording the number of busy servers at regular time intervals; these readings are then cumulated and their sum, after division by the number of observations, is an unbiased estimate of the carried load. The purpose of this paper is to derive exact formulas for the computation of the variance of this measurement in systems with arbitrary input and departure rates. The results obtained here thus apply to a wide class of teletraffic models which includes, in particular, the delay-and-loss systems with finite- or infinite-source inputs, exponential service times, and arbitrary defection rates from the queue. Problems related to computations are also considered, special attention being paid to the reduction of both computer time and storage when the number of states is large."
"A carbon transmitter model is presented, the purpose of which is to serve as a tool for computer-aided analysis of telephone set transmission characteristics. The derivation of the model is based upon the physical theory of the device. The parameters in the model are evaluated by comparing the analytically derived expressions for the device characteristics to the measured characteristics of a typical device. Because these parameters are related to the physical theory, the model not only serves its desired practical end, but also serves as a vehicle whereby an understanding is obtained of the relationship between device characteristics and physical theory."
"An offset paraboloidal reflector illuminated by a balanced feed horn constitutes an efficient launcher for coupling microwaves into quasioptical beams. Measurements on a launcher with low blockage show low cross polarization. The amplitude, phase, and polarization characteristics are predicted by two gaussian beam modes, and the resulting formulas are found to agree well with measurements at 19 and 28 GHz. For example, with increasing offset angles, the ratio of the maximum cross-polarized signal in the radiation pattern to the on-axis co-polarized signal is observed to vary from −44 to −37 dB, within 1 dB of the predicted variation."
"Forney's asymptotic upper bound for per-bit error probability in the detection of pulse-amplitude-modulated digital data in the presence of additive white gaussian noise was obtained for the case where the duration of the intersymbol interference is bounded. In this paper, we show the validity of Forney's bound under much weaker assumptions that allow unbounded intersymbol interference."
 "We describe a reliable method of preparing planar fiber tape ends by fiber fracture. Using this technique, with suitable precautions to preserve cleanliness during splice preparation, we have measured a splice loss of less than 0.25 dB in 99 percent of all attempts."
"We propose and demonstrate a new approach to the problem of splicing optical fibers in a fiber cable. The optical fiber cable subgroups (tapes) are made in such a way that the relative positions of the optical fibers are accurately maintained. By using glass as a rigid matrix material in which the optical fibers are held, we demonstrate that a simple scoring and stressing technique can be used to simultaneously prepare all the fiber ends for splicing."
"We describe a computer model of the human vocal cords and vocal tract that is amenable to dynamic control by parameters directly identified in the human physiology. The control format consequently provides an efficient, parsimonious description of speech information. The control parameters represent subglottal lung pressure, vocal-cord tension and rest opening, vocal-tract shape, and nasal coupling. Using these inputs, we synthesize vowel-consonant-vowel syllables to demonstrate the dynamic behavior of the cord/tract model. We show that inherent properties of the model duplicate phenomena observed in human speech; in particular, cord/tract acoustic interaction, cord vibration, and tract-wall radiation during occlusion, and voicing onset-offset behavior. Finally, we describe an approach to deriving the physiological controls automatically from printed text, and we present sentence-length synthesis obtained from a preliminary system."
"The development of the voice-frequency active filters for the D3 channel bank is described. These filters are the first single-substrate RC active filters using thin-film tantalum RC and silicon integrated-circuit technology to be produced on a large scale by Western Electric. To create complete confidence in both the design and the new technology, an extensive model building and testing program was undertaken. In addition, continuous interaction with manufacturing engineers resulted in a design that facilitated the introduction of this new technology in a large-scale manufacturing environment. Significant advances were made in reducing the complexity of tuning active filters. In fact, the tuning and testing procedure has been adapted for use with a totally automated computer-controlled test set. Furthermore, a Monte Carlo statistical simulation of the manufacturing process of the filters was developed. This model includes tolerances of the manufactured components, test set errors in measuring gain and component values, resistor adjustment accuracies, and temperature and aging behavior of the components. This computer program has been an invaluable tool in determining the requirements for tuning, testing, and optimizing the final design for minimum manufacturing cost."
"In using filter banks for processing speech signals, it is often important that the sum of the individual frequency responses of the bandpass filters (composite response) be flat with linear phase. This paper presents a technique for achieving flat composite response using linear-phase fir digital filters. The design method is based on some special properties of fir filters designed by the windowing method. Excellent response characteristics can be achieved with complete flexibility in choosing the center frequencies and bandwidths of the individual filters."
"Two techniques for designing a class of low-sensitivity, follow-the-leader, feedback-type active filters have been introduced by Hurtig and Laker-Ghausi. The FLF configuration consists of a cascade of second-and/or first-order sections, with feedback from each section back to the first. This paper presents an approach for designing FLF-type realization for all classes of filter functions. The technique is based on a shifted-companion form of the associated-state equations. Some salient features of Hurtig's primary resonator block, Laker-Ghausi's follow-the-leader feedback, and the shifted-companion-form techniques are presented below. (i) Hurtig's PRB realizes any all-pole (no finite transmission zeros) filter function. This includes the low-pass, high-pass, and symmetrical bandpass filters without finite zeros. Explicit design equations are available, and the individual sections in the array are identical. (ii) Laker-Ghausi's FLF realizes any symmetrical (including finite transmission zeros) bandpass filter function. The sections are not constrained to be identical, which allows optimization using this degree of freedom. Finite zeros are realized by a summation technique. (iii) The SCF realizes all types of filter functions, i.e., low-pass, high-pass, bandpass, all-pass, or band-reject filters. Explicit design equations are available. The first section can differ from the rest, thus allowing some optimization with standardization. Feed-forward as well as summation techniques can be used to realise the finite zeros. Two bandpass design examples using SCF, PRB, and/or Laker-Ghausi FLF techniques are given and compared with the low-sensitivity coupled (leapfrog) biquad, the conventional cascade biquad, and the passive ladder filter designs. The comparison shows that the passive filter gives"
"This paper considers several problems associated with envelope-derived timing recovery, equalization, and scrambling in synchronous data transmission. Particular attention is focused on the time intervals in which periodic data sequences are transmitted, such as during start-up or when an idle code is being transmitted. It is shown that the standard envelope-derived timing-recovery system may be significantly improved by zonal filtering of the received passband signal prior to forming the envelope. For phase-modulated systems, we discuss the limitations of the “precession” technique employed for the purpose of providing a periodic timing wave when there is an input of short period. The advantages of using a phase-locked loop to filter the envelope instead of a narrow-band filter are also described. A study of scrambler operation has provided an extension of previous results concerning the relationship between the input and output period. It is shown that the output period of several scramblers connected in tandem does not necessarily double with the addition of a stage, and that if a particular stage does not lock up then no succeeding stage can lock up."
"An analysis of a particular type of multiserver, multiqueue system is presented in which each queue has a finite number of waiting positions and the waiting positions are not vacated until service is completed. Thus, several customers in one queue can be served simultaneously. The steady-state distribution of states is derived and is used to obtain the probability of loss for each queue and the average delay of the system. This analysis is then used in the development of a design procedure to determine the minimum-cost configuration of waiting positions and servers to meet specified single-hour grade-of-service constraints. The results are applicable to the design of systems that utilize automatic call distributors. While this model does not include such effects as day-to-day variation and noncoincidence of peak loads among trunk groups, nevertheless the results properly reflect for the first time the interactions among the trunk groups terminated on the automatic call distributor and the attendants at the automatic call distributor."
"Blocking is considered for an N-trunk group of exponential servers with Poisson-offered load whose rate parameter varies with time. The infinite trunk case is solved by means of a rapidly convergent series of Poisson-Charlier polynomials. This solution is used to obtain practical approximations of blocking probability, transition probabilities, and recovery function for general time-variable offered load in the finite trunk-group case. An integral equation is derived satisfied by the blocking probability in the general case. In the situation of constant offered load, two additional methods are derived for providing easily computable approximations; one based on the integral equation, the other based on an approximate inversion of the Laplace transform. To aid in the latter approximation, bounds on the roots of Poisson-Charlier polynomials are obtained; in particular, an approximation is obtained for the dominant root. The inversion of the integral equation is studied with the purpose of providing the basis for future investigations of errors of approximation. Curves are provided for a number of examples permitting comparison of exact and approximate solutions."
 "Large stationary lead storage batteries play an ever increasing role in substation and generating station control systems and in providing the backup energy for emergencies. A definite need exists within the industry for an application guide and testing procedure to provide a common or standard method for selecting, applying, and installing batteries to meet station requirements. However,to provide a guide that can be used for determining the available capacity of the battery (especially for nuclear stations), this document will limit its scope to recommended practice for lead storage battery maintenance, testing. and replacement."
"A field survey to characterize echo performance of toll telephone connections was conducted in 1972. Information on echo path loss and echo path delay for talker echoes was obtained from a sample of nearly 1700 connections in the continental United States. This paper discusses the survey data acquisition techniques, the sample design, and the statistical results. A major result of the survey was the determination that echo path delay is significantly less than previously estimated. For the longest connections (2700 miles or 4345 km), the median round-trip echo delay is 45 ms, 11 ms less than previously calculated from the sum of connection segments."
"Glass fibers are in general not thick enough to withstand external forces on their own without suffering axial distortion, mode coupling, and loss. Thus, plastic jackets must be carefully designed to provide effective protection. We evaluate jacket designs ranging from the mere use of soft materials to the application of multiple plastic coatings and graphite reinforcement. We compute the distortion loss as a function of dimensional variations and of lateral forces considered typical for cable packaging. The protective quality of a jacket is found to depend on a combination of stiffness and compressibility and on the fiber characteristics."
"Experimental results are reported concerning the transmission, reflection, and depolarization of metal grids that reflect an upper band, centered at 30 GHz, and transmit a lower band, centered at 20 GHz. With a single grid, the transmission loss is less than 0.1 dB, and the rejection exceeds 44 dB. Depolarization is measured under realistic conditions with direct dual-mode feed excitation. In a 10-percent band, depolarization is below 34 dB at all scanning angles for both the transmitted and reflected waves. Experiments with two parallel resonant grids are also reported."
"This paper describes an optical-frequency pulse-position-modulation experiment using a GaAs luminescent diode as the source and either a pin or an avalanche photodiode as the detector. The experimental system transmits an audio band from 300 Hz to 3.4 kHz at an 8-kb/s repetition rate. Timing synchronization between the transmitter and receiver has been accomplished by two methods: by transmitting a separate clock signal and by recovering the timing from the ppm signal itself. Data show, with each scheme, peak-signal-to-rms-noise ratios of 70 dB can be achieved with the required average optical power at the receiver being − 73 dBm with a pin detector and − 88 dBm with an avalanche detector."
"An important problem in speech processing is to detect the presence of speech in a background of noise. This problem is often referred to as the endpoint location problem. By accurately detecting the beginning and end of an utterance, the amount of processing of speech data can be kept to a minimum. The algorithm proposed for locating the endpoints of an utterance is based on two measures of the signal, zero crossing rate and energy. The algorithm is inherently capable of performing correctly in any reasonable acoustic environment in which the signal-to-noise ratio is on the order of 30 dB or better. The algorithm has been tested over a variety of recording conditions and for a large number of speakers and has been found to perform well across all tested conditions."
"Specially doped (N = N0/√x) varactors offer a cubic relation between voltage and charge. Frequency tripling is thus possible without an idler frequency excitation at twice the input frequency. Here we have investigated a frequency tripler from 2.115 to 6.345 GHz without an idler frequency at 4.23 GHz, thus hopefully reducing the cost and complexity of the tripler. The results from such varactors indicate that, although frequency tripling is possible over a wide band, the efficiency and power-handling capacity are considerably lower than conventional frequency tripling with abrupt junction varactors excited at 4.23 GHz. The impedance matching is harder for these specially doped varactors, even though the mechanical construction is greatly simplified."
"We consider a general class of multibit adaptive quantizers in which the quantizer function is modified at every sampling instant according to a recursive law with the transitions depending on the value of the quantizer output. We obtain a rather comprehensive set of basic properties of the device which explain the interrelationship of different aspects of the device behavior and their dependence on the parameters of the adaptation algorithm. For the quantitative analysis of the device, we give formulas and bounds for the mean time required for the quantizer function to adapt from an arbitrary initial state to the optimal. A feature new with this work is a unified treatment and a common body of results for quantizers with both bounded and unbounded range. This paper extends all the analytical results reported in an earlier paper, which dealt with a restricted class of quantizers having only four levels. We also present new results from a computational investigation on quantizers up to four bits (sixteen levels). These results indicate, for well-designed examples of the respective classes, the kinds of improvement in performance that can be expected in going from three-bit (eight-level) to four-bit quantizers and from uniform to nonuniform quantizers."
"A new technique for very fast start-up of adaptive transversal-filter equalizers used in high-speed synchronous data communications is presented. A special training sequence whose period in symbols is equal to the number of equalizer taps is used initially to achieve an open eye pattern. Rapid convergence, even over highly distorted channels, is obtained because an ideal reference sequence is available at the receiver, but it is not necessary to synchronize the ideal reference with the received sequence. The special choice of the training sequence automatically provides the synchronized ideal reference needed for fast convergence, but the resulting equalizer coefficients may be cyclically displaced from their proper positions. After the eye is opened by this process, the equalizer coefficients are rotated to their proper positions, and decision-directed equalization is used with either a longer training sequence or random data to achieve final tap settings. Adjustments during the training period can be made with a gradient-type algorithm or with stochastic adjustment techniques; an exact analysis is possible for both of these schemes. Cyclic equalization is shown to provide perfect equalization at evenly spaced points in the frequency domain."
"Group theory impinges on the combinatorial study of connecting networks in a natural way: the stages, frames, and cross-connect fields from which many existing networks are built provide simple permutations out of which desired, complex assignments are built by composition. Some of the consequences of this interpretation are explored in this paper. In the group-theoretic setting, the action and role of the stages and fields become transparent, and many questions and results regarding networks can be regarded as problems about cosets, subgroups, factorizations, etc. This approach is particularly useful for the study of rearrangeable networks made of stages of square switches; such a network is rearrangeable if and only if the symmetric group of appropriate degree can be factored into products of certain subgroups associated with the network. Or again, the original Slepian-Duguid rearrangeability theorem corresponds to factoring a symmetric group into a product of double cosets of subgroups generated by stages."
"Concepts and calculations from group theory have led to a new way of demonstrating rearrangeability of networks made of stages of square switches and to new factorizations of symmetric groups of composite degree."
"Measurements of rain-produced depolarization for linearly polarized 20- and 30-GHz satellite signals oriented vertically (V) and horizontally (H) and a few degrees either side of V and H are required to determine both the proper polarization orientation for future systems and the depolarization at that orientation. The polarization received from area-coverage satellite beacons will vary considerably for different measuring sites within the coverage area. Calculation of rain-produced depolarization of one pair of orthogonally polarized signals from measurements of depolarization, differential attenuation, and differential phase of a different pair of orthogonally polarized signals will be required. Some effects of measurement errors on these calculations are shown. Accuracies on the order of ± 0.5 dB in differential attenuation and ± 2 degrees in differential phase are required in the measurements. Cross-polarization isolation of 25 dB in the measuring system is inadequate."
"A method for obtaining low-loss splices of multimode optical fibers has been devised that uses no adhesives, mechanical clamps, or adjustable alignment tools. Simultaneous splices were made of three-fiber as well as single-fiber pairs. The coupling efficiency was over 95 percent for single-fiber pairs and 93 percent for three-fiber pairs. The strength of the joint was two-thirds the breaking strength of the fibers."
"The loss induced in optical fibers by random bends in the fiber axis is studied by winding fibers under constant tension onto a drum surface that is not perfectly smooth. The tension forces the fibers to conform to slight surface irregularities, which can result in an increase in the optical loss on the order of 100 dB/km. This microbending loss may be a significant design consideration in system applications of low-loss optical fibers. Data are presented on the reduction of the effect by means of coatings and increased numerical aperture."
 "The feasibility of a microwave quasi-optical polarization diplexer has been demonstrated using photo-etched copper strips with thin mylar backing as a practical example. The insertion losses of the principal polarization and the cross polarization have been calculated and measured. The conducting strips must be aligned in a preferred direction, namely, perpendicular to the plane of incidence, to minimize cross-polarized radiation, whereas orientation of the plane of the grid with respect to the beam direction is not restricted. The measured cross-polarized radiation agrees with predictions from simple theoretical models of a magnetic current sheet for the transmission mode and an electric current sheet for the reflection mode. This type of diplexer has been successfully employed in studying the polarization properties of the 20-GHz signal from the ATS-6 satellite."
"The structural characteristics of preforms and optical fibers fabricated by modified chemical vapor deposition were studied by optical, interference, and scanning electron microscopy. It was observed that the structural features resulting from the deposition process are preserved through subsequent processing and appear in the fiber with the exception of a region at the center of the fiber. Here, selective evaporation of dopant material from the inner surface of the deposit results in a refractive index depression on the axis of the optical waveguide."
"A primary interest in any method for producing synthetic speech is to minimize the number of bits per second required to generate acceptable quality speech. An efficient method for transmitting the linear-prediction parameters has been found by using the techniques of differential PCM. Using this technique, speech transmission is achieved employing fewer than 1500 bits/s. Further reductions in the linear-prediction storage requirements can be realized at a cost of higher system complexity by transmission of the most significant eigenvectors of the parameters. This technique in combination with differential PCM can lower the storage to 1000 bits/s."
"An approximate theory is developed to predict the frequency response of a self-resonant grid. The grid is comprised of capacitive and inductive elements and exhibits a band-stop resonance. The analysis is based upon the derivation, from physical considerations, of an equivalent circuit representation of the grid structure. Predicted results compare well with measured data."
"A study of the marker-register dial-tone delay problem in No. 5 crossbar switching machines led to a special type of cyclic queuing model. In this paper, we present a method for calculating approximately the steady-state delays of an arriving customer. When applied to the marker-register problem, the model emphasizes the order in which markers are assigned to waiting calls and the fact that part of the markers' time is unproductive when an “all registers busy” condition occurs. Some numerical results are presented, which agree with the observed phenomenon that, for a constant marker load, the delays of Touch-Tone® calls are influenced by the load on the dial-pulse originating registers, and vice versa. The results are compared to those of a simulation of the same problem. The numerical results compare favorably in the range of loads that produce a dial-tone speed of between 0.05 and 0.15."
"Recently obtained field data and theoretical studies show that, for a fixed subscriber calling rate, dial-tone delay in No. 5 crossbar can be appreciably increased by high average line-link frame loads and also by poor load balance. The increased delay is caused by waste dial-tone-marker usage generated by a small number of calls that encounter horizontal group blocking in obtaining a dialing connection. This paper discusses an analytical model to predict the time from receiver off-hook to receipt of dial tone under various service conditions in No. 5 crossbar."
 "The paper in this special supplement to The Bell Syetem Technical Journal differ markedly from the more quantitative typical B.S.T.J. papers, which are characterized by their analytical and experimental approach, usually with a definitive telecommunications tie-in. The reason for this contrast is that these papers, taken together, are intended to serve a quite special purpose."
"The U.S. government needs and obtains a wide range of services from the nation's busubesses. From the Bell System, these services range from the large amounts of ordinary telephone service required to carry on its day-to-day operations to the development of complex systems designed to enaure the nation's defense. With respect to the latter, Bell System policy is summarized in a remark by H. I. Romnes at a stockholders' meeting on April 15, 1970:"

It provides a brief history of SAFEGUARD, discusses the hardware and the software involved, and then focuses on the technical and managerial approaches to producing the software"
"The Data-Processing System Performance Requirements (DPSPRs) specify the required performance to be provided by the SAFEGUARD system software. They were developed primarily by one systems engineering department at Bell Laboratories. Their objective was to specify the required functional performance in sufficient detail to permit software development. The DPSPRs evolved from similar documentation that was developed for systems prior to SAFEGUARD. Their history, development, use, and document control system are described. Suggested improvements are also discussed."

"The Safeguard Maintenance and Diagnostic Subsystem (M & DSS) is a unique, independent, hardware group within the data-processing system through which the nonreal-time functions of fault detection and isolation are performed. In this paper, the M & DSS hardware and fault detection software are described and system performance is reviewed."
"This paper provides an overview of one aspect of the SAFEGUARD approach to digital maintenance–the Maintenance and Diagnostic (M & D) program-fault dictionary. The M & D program detects the presence of faults. The associated fault dictionary provides fault lists for automatic fault isolation; it is generated by executing the maintenance program in an environment simulating the action of hardware in the presence of faults. The paper also provides some detailed discussion of simulator-performance improvements."
"The Central Logic and Control (CLC) is the digital computer that controls SAFEGUARD. This paper describes the novel features of the CLC operating system, presents its design rationale, and points out its limitations. Emphasis is on the characteristics that make the operating system suitable for applications other than SAFEGUARD. These include its ability to control as many as ten processors, its ability to initiate the execution of a program within milliseconds of an event, and its ability to detect and isolate faulty hardware racks without manual intervention."
"Process design, structuring the real-time program for the CLC, was one of the difficult aspects of SAFEGUARD software development. Initially, there were no significant guidelines or criteria. In the course of the project, basic process-design rules were developed and significant experience was acquired. Some techniques that emerged are the use of short-running, asynchronous tasks; overlays to minimize storage requirements; and multiple storing of programs to minimize processor queuing."
"This paper considers two problems: how to build the SAFEGUARD software so that it is testable and how to test it as realistically as possible. The first is solved by an iterative process of adding software capabilities, testing them, then adding more. The second problem is solved by driving SAFEGUARD with computer-generated radar echoes."
"Errors occur even in well-designed, well-tested systems. This paper describes how errors are detected and controlled in the Safeguard system and makes recommendations pertaining to the design of error control in large-scale, real-time control systems."
"The debugging of Safeguard software was performed in phases, each with a unique environment, problems, and debugging tools. The unique aspects of each phase are described here with special emphasis on the debugging tools used. Although the multiprocessor configuration introduced new kinds of software “bugs” and complicated the debugging problem, the real-time character of the system had a greater overall impact."
"This paper gives a critical overview of the development of a selected set of support software programs. These programs comprise part of the support environment required to make the Safeguard system application software and hardware operational."
"The history of the design and implementation of CENTRAN, an extendible language, is presented as an example to language designers. The history is viewed in the context of four groups of factors: environmental issues, general design issues, specific design issues, and implementation issues. The paper concludes with an evaluation of the design decisions that were made."
"This paper deals with the development of a large systems program in a high-level language. The reasons for selecting a high-level language, the most extensively used features, the benefits derived, and the significant problems encountered are described."
"In evaluating and certifying the Safeguard abm system, it was necessary to interrogate and analyze the massive volume of data generated during tests. The number of different reports, listings, and plots was so large and the variety so great that a flexible data reduction system had to be placed at the disposal of the user community. At the same time, the system had to be highly efficient and quickly available to be used at all. The Safeguard Data Reduction System was designed to accomplish these objectives."
"“Bird-dogging” is the process of tracking down computer center users who are either having problems and therefore are not getting their job done or who are using a disproportionate share of the computer's resources. Analysis of utilization data for the Safeguard support computer centers has shown that the problems caused by these users can be of alarming magnitude, leading some observers to believe that bird-dogging is the single most effective system performance tuning activity that can be performed. Bird-dogging is an integral component in reliable project scheduling and effective cost control. This paper discusses the methods now used to identify problem users and some experiences gained from the effort."
"This paper describes a type of flowchart review used as a program-development technique in which each programmer is required to give a box-by-box explanation of a detailed flowchart of his program to a small group of critical colleagues. Such reviews appear to have caught all the major software design errors before the code was written. It also cut the software-development time by at least 25 percent, representing a return of at least 10:1 in terms of software-development time saved as a result of the week of the group's time spent in the flowchart review sessions."
"This paper discusses the phased implementation of structured programming techniques over a period of two years. It was observed that, by standardizing programming techniques, the resulting program becomes more maintainable and programmer productivity increases. By confining the clerical work of programming to the program librarian, productivity again increases."
"This paper describes the management approach developed to support the Safeguard software design effort. Project organization and some techniques used for planning and control are discussed."
"Large software projects require control procedures to ensure that changes to code can be made systematically. Programmers, however, wish to be able to make changes to their programs without being bothered by administrative considerations. This paper explores the attitudes of people toward change control and the problems associated with establishing a workable system."
"This paper describes the Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) contract that has been used to control a major software development effort, amounting to approximately $30 million annually. The amount of the award fee is determined periodically, based on a unilateral judgment of supplier performance. The lessons learned in handling a contract of this type and magnitude are summarized. The cpaf contract has proven to be a good means of ensuring the continued attention of supplier management that is necessary for obtaining high performance on time."
"A broad-based study of software project management for the Safeguard project is presented. Safeguard posed unprecedented project management challenges because of its size and complexity, yet the project was successful in attaining its objectives. This account of what some of the challenges were and which approaches were most effective in meeting them will hopefully suggest guidelines for the management of other software projects. Subjects include planning, methods for gathering status information, control actions, requirements, and programming methodology; also, differences between managing a software and a hardware project are explored. This study is based on intensive semistructured interviews with 26 Safeguard software managers at all levels concerning their experiences on the project and opinions derived from them. The views expressed are limited to those of the individual managers interviewed and do not represent a consensus of Safeguard management."

"This paper presents an analytical and experimental study of a capacitor-diode voltage multiplier without a transformer which offers the possibility of high efficiency with light weight. D.c.-d.c. conversion efficiencies of about 94 percent were achieved at output powers of 150 watts at 1000 volts using 8× multiplication. A detailed identification of losses was made, including forward drop losses in component, switching losses, reverse junction capacitance charging losses, and charging losses in the main ladder capacitors."

"In the Reliability and Quality Engineering Test Laboratory at the NASA Lewis Research Center a nondestructive, corona-vacuum test facility for testing power system components was developed using commercially available hardware. The test facility was developed to simulate operating temperature and vacuum while monitoring corona discharges with residual gases. This facility is being used to test various high voltage power system components."
"One would be hard pressed to describe the current status of power electronics analysis and design with a single word, but it may very well be “dynamic.” Analysts have responded to the unique challenges in Dower electronics by developing a somewhat bewildering array of analytical tools and techniques. Yet this same diversity of approach serves diverse purposes in a variety of applications."
"A continuous, low-frequency, small-signal averaged model for the tapped-inductor boost converter with input filter is developed and experimentally verified, from which the dc transfer function and the small-signal line input and duty ratio input describing functions can easily be derived. A new effect due to storage-time modulation in the transistor switch is shown to explain observed excess filter damping resistance without associated loss in conversion efficiency. The presence of an input filter can cause a severe disturbance, even a null, in the control duty ratio describing function, with consequent potential performance difficulties in a converter regulator."
"Using state variable representation a nonlinear, discrete-time system is derived that models the converter exactly. This system is linearized about its steady state solution, and converter stability, transient response and audio susceptibility are studied. The steady state solution of the converter is stable if and only if all the roots of the linearized system are absolutely less than unity. Excellent agreement with laboratory test data has been observed."
"Stability analysis and transient response predictions of PWM controlled DC/DC regulators are now feasible in both continuous and discontinuous mode A linear equivalent continuous model of the power stage is firstly established for the boost and the buck converter by means of state variable representation for each of the elementary structure occuring within one sampling period. This equivalent model turns out to be of first order for the discontinuous mode and of 2nd order for the continuous mode. A general computer program has been implemented for the derivation of such a model and for the stability analysis and transient response of multiloop regulators. Special emphasis has been given to the boost converter in light conduction mode operation whether an AC feedback loop is included or not. The existence of the non-minimum phase effect associated with such a regulator for a heavy operation mode is shown to be dependent of the sampling frequency."
"Three modes of operations are identified for a class of self-oscillating Dc-to-Dc converters. Results for the maximum feedback gain of the converter are presented and compared for the three operating modes. Conclusions are drawn as to the possible application of these results to converter design. The large signal stability of the converter is discussed and possible ways of insuring its absolute stability are suggested."
"A new procedure for the selection of magnetic cores for use in energy-storage dc-to-dc power converters which eliminates the need for an automated computer search algorithm and stored data file is presented. The converter configurations included in the procedure are the three commonly encountered single-winding converters for voltage step-up, for current step-up and for voltage step-up/current step-up, and for the two-winding converter for voltage step-up/current step-up. For each converter configuration, three types of controllers are considered—constant-frequency, constant on-time and constant off-time. Using concepts developed from analyses of these converters by considering the transfer of energy by means of an energy-storage inductor or transformer, a special table of parameters calculated from magnetic core data is constructed and leads to a considerably simplified design procedure."
"Some fundamental mathematical relationships governing operation of buck-type switched-mode power supplies using non-ideal devices are explored. Limitations of non-ideal devices are noted. Methods of reducing stresses on the switching element and reducing reverse recovery current in the freewheeling diode are considered. Design of practical buck-type supplies employing these methods is discussed. The trade off possibilities that exist between five key parameters involved in a practical design are given particular attention."
"Because of the many complex subsystem interactions which occur within modern electronic power-processing systems, it is often quite difficult to accurately predict total system performance. A digital computer simulation technique, which can be used to study such composite power-conditioning systems, is applied to a spacecraft direct-energy-transfer power-processing system. The results obtained duplicate actual system performance with considerable accuracy. The validity of the approach and its usefulness in studying various aspects of system performance such as steady-state characteristics and transient responses to severely varying operating conditions are demonstrated experimentally."
"The papersa presented in this session covered a very broad range of applications. The first paper covered the application of solid state DC circuit breakers. The second paper covers the problems of paralleling DC power supplies. The third paper covered an approach to generate the low DC voltages and high currents required for large computers. The fourth and fifth papers covered an area that a great deal of work is being done in today. That area is single-ended DC-to-DC converters. I personally prefer to call the basic single ended converters “Uni-polar Inverters.”"
"Three types of solid state Remote Power Controller (RPC) circuits for 120 VDC spacecraft distribution systems have been developed and evaluated. Both current limiting and non-current limiting modes of overload protection were developed and were demonstrated to be feasible. A second generation of circuits was developed which offers comparable performance with substantially less cost and complexity. Electrical efficiency for both generations is 98.5 to 99%. This paper describes various aspects of the circuit design, trade-off studies, and experimental test results. Comparisons of design parameters, component requirements, and engineering model evaluations will emphasize the high efficiency and reliability of the designs."
"A modular dc-to-dc converter system operating from a 140-volt source and supplying a 5- to 75-kW load is presented. The control concepts and unique output characteristics of the individual converters, developed to permit efficient and reliable parallel operation of bulk converters, are described."
"This paper presents a detailed description on the system configuration and power supply circuit of the power supply equipment for large scale computor. The large scale computor developed recentl3r employs a large number of LSIs to realize high speed performance and miniaturization. A highly-accurate voltage stability under low voltage and high current conditions is required for the power supply equipment used for such a computor. For example, the output current exceeds 1500A at an output voltage of 5V, while the necessary voltage accuracy is ± 1.5% or less. The off-line switching regulator (the operating frequency is 20kHz) has been adopted as the power supplying technique. The stabilization technique of output voltage is based on SR control using a saturable reactor in the constrained mode."
"Three basic single-ended converter configurations are compared analytically and experimentally. The ringing-coil converter is recommended for low-power, high voltage, single output applications where low cost is essential. The single-ended half-wave transformer-coupled converter is recommended where the maximum output power is being squeezed for a given switching transistor power handling capability. The single-ended full-wave converter is recommended for applications with tight regulation, size, ripple and trouble voltage requirements."
"A method for resonant switching applicable to dc to dc power conversion is presented. Zero current switching together with resonant control of current waveforms avoids solid state power device second breakdown stresses encountered with high voltage switching in conventional circuitry. General theory of circuit operation and design is described. Circuitry and performance are outlined for an operational 1500 watt dc to dc converter designed for nominal input voltage of 270 Vdc, with regulated output voltage in the 90 Vdc range. Operational performance and projected power densities (watts per pound) are found to be attractively competitive with the existing state-of-the-art. Further development work is being done at Martin Marietta Aerospace using resonant switching frequencies in the 200 KHz range for space flight hardware. Projected power density in this application is 140 watts per pound, under high performance and reliability requirements."
"Presented is a converter philosophy for controlled transfer and transformation of electric energy through internal series resonant circuits at high internal power frequencies in excess of 10 kHz. Control of the continuously oscillating high Q series resonant circuit is attained by adjustment of the phase angle ψr between the exciting voltage and the resonant current. Only a very small fraction of the energy transferred to the load is absorbed by the resonant circuits to replace the power dissipated therein. Moderate and unconditionally predictable voltage and current stresses on components result from definite control of static and dynamic behavior of the system. This system is suited for construction of failsafe and highly efficient, low cost, submegawatt, single module converters with use of currently available components."
"A type of industrial size dc converters for submegawatt applications is described and illustrated with the characteristics of a small scale 10 kW model. High conversion efficiency near 97 percent is maintained at full power and with an internal frequency of operation near 10 kHz. The system is characterized by the behavior of a true current source with inherent short circuit capability of its output terminals. All power is processed via a firmly controlled high Q series resonant circuits. Feasibility of power densities in excess of 1 kW/kg component weight is demonstrated. This high power density reflects itself in low quantities of material needed for construction of these systems. Operation of the dc converter as part of a rectifier-filter-converter system, powered from a three phase supply line is described. Test data demonstrate a high power factor p.f. ≃ 0.95 for all conditions of converter loading. Data obtained from a thyristor bridge-filter system are presented and subjected to comparative analysis."
"Taken as a whole this session was of interest to people working in power electronics at all power levels since there were papers covering aspects of transistors, thyristors and power rectifier diodes. In addition, one paper, on transient thermal analysis of semiconductor devices, was applicable to all devices."
"Recent advances in the understanding of bipolar device physics permit the derivation of a number of quantitative relationships which are useful for improving existing designs and also for assessing the feasibility of proposed devices. This paper describes three important tradeoffs which apply to the design and performance of high-voltage transistors in inverter circuits."
"The intent of this paper is to serve as a designer's guide to enable him to custom design-in the semiconductor reliability required by his power electronic circuit. Normal and special testing procedures to eliminate defective product are considered, along with guide lines to extend the useful life of the product. Successful applications are shown."
"In spite of its importance in the rating and reliable application of power diodes and thyristors, the computation of instantaneous junction temperature has been a poorly understood and generally dreaded process among equipment designers. Under many practical circumstances, it has only been feasible by means of lengthy computer programs."
"A method for measuring the thermal resistance, Rθ, of integrated power Darlington transistors is described that is based upon the emitter-only switching technique. It is shown that for specified measurement conditions this method can be used to measure the average thermal resistance, Rθ(l+2), of the input and output transistors of the Darlington pair and is therefore applicable to production-line monitoring of the thermal characteristics of the Darlington. It is shown that although a direct measurement of the thermal resistance, Rθ (2), of the output transistor cannot be made for most Darlingtons, an indirect determination of Rθ(2) can be made using the emitter-only switching technique and a simple equation. Comparisons of the differences between the infrared-determined thermal resistance and the electrically-measured thermal resistance of Darlingtons and of discrete power transistors illustrate that the accuracy of the Darlington measurements is comparable with that achievable for discrete devices. It is also shown that measurements which attempt to use the collector-base voltage of the output transistor of the Darlington as a temperature-sensitive-parameter, either alone or in conjunction with an output commutating diode (when present), are too sensitive to the magnitude of the measuring current to be reliable. Also, the use of the base-current screen for hot spots, as used for discrete transistors, is marginally applicable to integrated Darlingtons, but it is shown that the emitter-base voltage sensed during emitter-only switching is quite effective for detecting hot-spot formation."
"Standard dynamic transistor parameters have proven to be inadequate in defining the response of NPN−N transistors in high frequency power circuits. Two new parameters, related to the process of conductivity modulation of the N−N collector, are proposed to describe the switching characteristics associated with the quasi-saturation region."
"A 2 MeV electron irradiation production technique for tailoring the switching speed of high power semiconductor diodes is discussed. This technique is compared with gold doping and its inherent advantages are presented. Among the latter are precise control of fast switching characteristics, excellent reproducibility and no increases in leakage at low switching speeds."
"Power semiconductor switches serve as key elements in the vast majority of power electronic systems. The papers in this session illustrate the fact that it is possible to fabricate a wide variety of power semiconductor switches with present silicon device technology."
"Toshiba has developed two types of high power npvn transistors which have collector current ratings of 400A and collector-emitter voltage ratings of 300V. The first is a conventional one and the second is a monolithic Darlington-connected one. Both have the same 40mmφ pellet size. They are produced by triple diffusion techniques. The structures, features and electrical characteristics of these transistors are described."
"A model has been proposed and solved in which all Darlington circuits may be represented to a first order approximation by five constants, one of which may be normalized. Experimental verification has been provided offering excellent agreement with theory. Several orders of magnitude improvement in current handling ability have been shown to exist for multistage Darlington circuits over conventional discrete transistors."
"A thyristor is discussed in which high gate turn-off capability has been achieved with a very simple gate-cathode geometry through the use of a highly conductive layer in the gated base, a high gate-cathode breakdown voltage, and an integral non-regenerative section in which final turnoff occurs."
"In this paper a simple means for accurately predicting the breakdown voltage of planar devices with a single field limiting ring is presented. A large mass of theoretical data was generated and then reduced to a single plot which shows the fraction of the ideal breakdown voltage that can be attained with the use of a field limiting ring. This curve can be applied to devices with virtually any substrate doping, junction curvature, and surface concentration. The key to reducing this large amount of data to a single plot is the fact that the data is plotted as a function of a normalized radius of junction curvature which is a precise measure of the curvature effect for virtually any device. Experimental data on the breakdown voltage for 640 devices with single field rings encompassing 16 different separations between the main junction and the field ring are shown. The theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with this data."
"A computer model of light-fired thyristors has been developed which calculates device voltage and the spatial distributions of current and temperature as functions of time throughout multiple pulse chains."
"Solid state switch stack assemblies capable of switching 5,000 V and 5,000 A were demonstrated using new high current Reverse Switching Rectifier (RSR) switch elements. Device characteristics, circuit applications, and test results describe this breakthrough in high power switch technology."
"The sixth and final session of the Sixth Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference consisted of four papers which illustrated well the breadth of concerns which engage engineers charged with the design of electronic power processing equipment. The first paper by L. L. Ogborn presents a new SCR inverter configuration which permits the injection of power from an auxiliary energy source, such as solar cells, into a standard 60 Hz utility system. The motivation for such a system is to avail one's self of locally-available but less-dependable energy sources, thereby effecting economies and reducing the consumption of fossil fuels. The second paper by J. M. Hudak presents some ideas and electronic circuits that are useful in protecting electrical power systems from undesirable overload and under-load conditions. The third paper by T. J. Hart is concerned with the level of acoustic noise generated by molybdenum permalloy powder cores used in dc-to-dc converters applications. A model is presented for the magnetostrictive effects which are the principal contributor to the acoustic output. The fourth paper was in the form of a late-news oral presentation by D. F. Partridge on the evaluation of a series of new concepts and improved SCR commutation circuits. The latter paper is not included in the published proceedings."
"This paper describes a single-phase, series-resonant inverter which injects a sinusoidal current into a load while a standard AC utility source is connected to the load and which can be used in photovoltaic applications. At moderate power levels the inverter requires DC input in the kilovolt range but will operate over a wide input voltage range. Control of the inverter is relatively simple and parallel operation with multiple DC sources with different DC input levels is easily accomplished. The circuit has no stand-alone capability at the present stage of development."
"A three-phase current sensing fault detection network has been developed employing an all solid state design. Systems equipped with such a network will be deprived of three-phase power in the event that either excessive or insufficient current is monitored in any or all of the three-phase power lines. The system design can be expanded to include a system shutdown capability for any number of sensing inputs from various critical portions of the circuit being monitored."
"Acoustic noise in a molybdenum permalloy powder (MPP) core transformer is analyzed and modeled as vibration induced by magnetostriction. The model indicates the relationship between physical parameters, primary and secondary waveforms, and the magnetostriction coefficient and their effects on acoustic output."
"In IEEE and PESC papers given in 1973 and 1974 the subject of Power Electronic reliability was explored. Past and potential problem areas were explored, and a survey of international users and manufacturers pointed out areas for further study."
"One easily overlooked aspect of electronic design is partial discharges and voltage breakdown at low gas pressures. On many occasions in the space program equipment losses from partial discharges and voltage breakdown have resulted in only partial mission successes. This rap session on high voltage electronics is intended to give design engineers an opportunity to exchange information on causes of high voltage problems in space flight and how to avoid the costly experiences of the past."
"The rap session provided an informal forum for dissemination of information on the state of the art in modeling and simulation of power processing systems. Merits of time domain and frequency domain approaches were debated and the use of these techniques for the prediction of performance and the optimization of a design were discussed. Although it appears that the present state of the art is somethat primative, interest is high and continued progress and improvement should be forthcoming."
"Presents an index of the authors whose articles are published in the conference proceedings record."
"Presents the back cover of this proceedings volume."
"The two standards, IEEE Std 279-1971 (ANSI N42.7-1972), Criteria for Protection Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations, and IEEE Std 308-1974, Standard Criteria for Class IE Power Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations, establish minimum requirements for the Class IE power and protection systems for nuclear reactors producing steam for electric power generation. These requirements include, but are not limited to, the capability for testing the Class IE power and protection systems. To develop tests and establish test procedures, an expansion and interpretation of the test capabilities specified in IEEE Std 279-1971 and IEEE Std 308-1974 are necessary."
   "A program has been developed to permit a minicomputer and a computer terminal to be used to generate timing tapes for additive color motion-picture film printers. Unlike conventional “hard-wired” tape generators, the computer system has a degree of flexibility that permits error correction during the timing process, permits previously cut timing tapes to be decoded rapidly, and permits the computer to be used for general calculations when not being employed as a timing device."
"The previous network operation in Toronto is briefly outlined and the reasons are given for the program of remodeling and augmenting the facilities. The Network Control Centre (NCC), two new transmitter booths and the Machine Room have been put on the fourth floor of the Toronto TV Building in what had been a kinerecording and office area, and the network and transmitter switchers housed in Master Control on the second floor. The Machine Room has a telecine machine for each of the booths and also has eight VTRs and space allowed for adding two more VTRs and up to three VTR cassette machines. The computer control system permits assigning any of the VTRs to the transmitter booths, to NCC and three utility rooms on the second floor, any one of which may be associated with the presentation of the initial network program stream."
"Certain features of a switching system used to assign videotape machines to recording and playback functions lend themselves to automation control. A suitable system was built and installed at the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., Toronto, to control operations of eight Presentation Area VTRs. Some features of the design are discussed, including modifications introduced after some operational use in order to give greater reliability and better operational features. Although based on a particular VTR assignment system, the comments are applicable to systems using any type of machinery requiring unattended automatic switching."
"The principles of signal digitization as they relate to digital television are presented in such a way as to lay groundwork for future digital television papers. To clarify the steps that are involved, a hypothetical “manual” conversion of an analog signal to its digital equivalent is examined. For sampling color television signals, the best sampling rate is considered to be exactly three times the color subcarrier frequency. Various methods of digitization are mentioned, and those suitable for wideband signals are defined. Quantization error and the problems of noise and noise measurement are discussed. The great advantage of handling television signals digitally is that digital quantities are capable of being sent, received, switched, stored, recorded and delayed virtually without distortion. Whatever bad effects accrue from conversion to and from the digital mode need accrue only once. Whatever ills can befall a digital signal, short of total loss, they can be made invisible and they do not accumulate."
"Television image enhancement has long been accomplished by using analog circuits to operate on the analog television signal and thereby emphasize both horizontal and vertical transitions. Now it is feasible to perform comparable image enhancement by digital techniques operating in real time on a pulse-code-modulated NTSC television signal. Several algorithms have been developed to generate vertical and horizontal video details from PCM NTSC television signals encoded at a 10.7-MHz rate (three times the color subcarrier frequency) and at a 14.3-MHz rate (four time the subcarrier frequency). Practical design concepts are presented to implement digital image enhancers. In addition to ensuring the stability, accuracy and reliability that are the usual advantages of digital systems, digital image enhancement will enable video processing techniques to be used that can actually be performed best by digital means. In particular, more nearly optimum coring or “crispening” circuits will be possible and the detail signals will be easily programmable, which may permit automatic adaptive enhancement."
"Videotape recorders have existed since 1956 and over the years have been perfected to the point where they provide a virtually “transparent” storage medium; the average viewer cannot distinguish a taped production from a live one. Nevertheless, the supremacy of these conventional analog VTRs is about to be challenged by rapidly developing digital technology. Digital VTRs, which may be commercially available in the next 5 to 10 years, are expected to provide the advantages of automatic operation and potentially lower operating costs. Multiple generations of programs (copies of copies) may be possible with little or no degradation with digital VTRs. Two major problem areas in the development of digital VTRs are how to reduce the very high bit rate required (presently on the order of 100 megabits/second) and at the same time reduce the error rate to about 1 part in 107. Intense efforts are being made to meet these requirements with very efficient encoding and with error correction and detection circuits. It is thought that exotic storage techniques such as laser-beam holography on thermoplastic film will become practical too late to influence the near-term market for digital magnetic VTRs."
"Television in Japan operates under a dual system, one being NHK (Nippon Hoso Kyokai; Japan Broadcasting Corporation) that brings coverage to the entire country and the other being commercial broadcasters whose respective service areas are limited, as a rule, to a single district. NHK is financed with the receiver's fee while the commercial broadcasters are financed with income from advertisements. NHK's nationwide broadcasting networks include the General Television Service (GTV) and the Educational Television Service (ETV). The existing state of each service as of 31 December 1974 was as follows:"
              "Some four years ago, a small study group was set up in Toronto to investigate the potential of super 8 in television and to advise on suitable equipment. Since then the group has tested many super-8 systems, prepared demonstration materials, advised producers, promoted standardization and recently proposed a super-8 system for use in small broadcast centers. The following report outlines the work done by the group and notes some of its findings. The merits and availability of super-8 equipment, such as cameras, sound recording and reproducing machinery, editing tables, telecine and rear-screen projection facilities and processing means are discussed on the basis of the study group's findings. The conclusion is reached that super-8 systems may eventually become an additional television production tool. The presentation of the report was accompanied by a demonstration of the picture quality obtained from various super-8 films on television monitors set up for the purpose. This progress report on experimentation with super-8 film in television applications is being published as information which, it is hoped, will be of help to others in the field."
"Audio engineers who design magnetic record and playback equipment for magnetic prestriped super-8 motion-picture films require a knowledge of the magnetic and electroacoustic properties of the film for optimum system design. Although all of our prestripes have similar inherent magnetic properties, the resultant audio data depend upon whether an 8mm or 16mm format is tested. The different film velocities, record track widths, and equalization standards involved with these formats have a significant effect on the audio performance. The scope of this paper is therefore limited to the super-8 films. In an attempt to help guide the equipment designers and customers, we have chosen to present the properties of our prestripes in an absolute manner whenever possible, as well as to report the conventional measurements relative to a specific reference. Shortcircuit flux values are given to permit calculation of the actual head output voltages to be expected. Furthermore, the intermodulation and harmonic distortion measurements, and the saturation output levels relative to an absolute shortcircuit flux level, provide additional data to predict the recording quality obtainable from the magnetic prestripe. For convenience in a qualitative appraisal, the prestripes are also compared on a relative basis with a full-width coated magnetic film. The Eastman Kodak Co. prestriped super-8 film audio output, frequency response, and surface characteristics are shown to be similar to those of good-quality audiotape."
"Since the Bell & Howell Model C printer was put in operation more than a dozen years ago, technological advances have provided a potential for greater production and more effective controls. A kit has been designed for remodeling the Model C printer not only to run at high speeds but also to print forward as well as in reverse, with a reliable braking system for sudden stops. The printer can be set to any one of five different speeds, up to 600 ft/min (183 m/min). Three take-up torque motors have been added for the reverse printing operation. Other improvements are: a light valve checking device, a frame count cuing system and a new photoelectric tape reader. The kit components can be added to an existing printer without making any internal changes and without using a soldering iron."
"As an aid for many technicians involved in film and television production, the Samcine Mk II Calculator has been designed particularly to help film and television cameramen calculate depth of field, equivalent exposures, metric equivalent distances, film running times, picture width and height, lens angles and color-temperature compensation. A complementary paper by W. B. Pollard immediately following in this Journal describes the design and construction of the calculator and the mathematical relations involved."
"In recent years cameramen have complained that, in practice, the true depth of field is often less than that indicated on the sliding scale types of depth-of-field calculators. The reasons for this are examined and a new calculator, more accurate and versatile than its predecessors, is described."
"The fundamentals of colorimetry are examined as they apply to color television. Human color responses are subjective and highly variable. Nevertheless an approach is presented which should permit pleasing results to be obtained with a high probability. Of concern is the design of the spectral transmission of the color-splitting optics used with the television camera. This is coupled with the use of electronic matrixing and considerations of signal-to-noise ratio, luminous sensitivity and camera tube lag."
          "The entertainment potential of the videodisc is by now obvious to those who have followed the technological developments. Videodisc systems, however, are not limited to the ordinary linear playback mode (start at the beginning, go through to the end of the program), and the possibility of using electronic addressing of program segments and the random access capability now has educators excited about the videodisc as an interactive instructional tool. With automatic switching of a 30-min program disc from motion to the freeze-frame mode, it will be possible to intersperse motion sequences with still frames and greatly extend instruction times. Concepts can be taught with motion sequences, comprehension can be tested with still-frame questions, and the program can be continued by branching according to whether correct or incorrect answers are inputted through a keyboard. Preliminary estimates indicate that the cost of instruction due to the hardware will be about 30 to 60 cents per hour. If more than 20% of the disc contains still frames and the market uses 10,000 discs (or 100 discs 100 times each), then the cost for an hour of interactive instruction would be about 75 cents. The full potential for individualized interactive instruction must await the development of single-frame editing and encoding systems and the interactive keyboards."
"Based on a paper presented at the 1ERE Conference on Video and Data Recording held at Loughborough on 10th to 12th July 1973"
"It has been slightly more than one year since all of the film newsgathering equipment at Station KMOX-TV in St. Louis was removed and replaced with electronic newsgathering equipment. The conversion has permitted news crews to provide both live and recorded coverage of news events with an immediacy that was not possible before. Live coverage can be achieved by relaying the video signal from the cameras to a support vehicle either by cable or by 13-GHz microwave; from there it goes by 2-GHz microwave to an unmanned relay station which beams it to the News Center as a 7-GHz signal. Both field and studio facilities are described in detail, and specific numerical comparisons are given to show how well the new system has achieved its design objectives: improved immediacy, improved productivity (more stories in the important period late in the day), and substantial reduction of overall operating costs."
"A TV “break” control room has been designed to handle both video and audio source switching and transitions. While audio usually follows the video switcher, there are frequent occasions when these functions must be temporarily separated. Program material must be underfaded during announcements. Cueing, crossfading, and outfading of tape cartridges is required. These and other special functions are either accomplished automatically or are preset in advance of the event, after which normal functions are then self-restored. Since these more complex audio operations are required during periods of high activity with video switching, it is essential that operationally simple and reliable means be provided to enable a single operator to perform these functions."
"The overall concept of this unique method of final audio mixing for network television programs is described. This “double-system” approach, using coincidental SMPTE time code on an eight-channel audio recorder with “workprint” picture information from a 1-inch (25-mm) videotape unit, allows greatly improved freedom for the production staff. Equipment, personnel, and step-by-step procedures are discussed in detail."
"Chemical-process engineers working with film-processing technicians in a major effort have developed new film-processing facilities for high-speed processing of the new Eastman Color SP Print II film. The new facilities have major advantages compared with facilities that have just evolved. The from-the-ground-up approach was taken in the interests of reducing ecological impact, improving worker safety and convenience, and turning out high-quality product at lower cost. Subsystems of the facilities are discussed in detail, including flowrators, tanks, temperature control, recirculation control, washwaters, replenishment, filtering, silver recovery, and chemical control. Very careful monitoring and control are needed throughout, but economies in materials, lessened environmental impact, improved safety, and a sense of accomplishment by technicians who are also achieving a high-quality product are cited as major gains. Additional experience is expected to lead to further advances."

             "The Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles was the setting for the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers' 117th Technical Conference. By every measure, it was the most successful conference the Society has ever had. There were 1200 registered and many more attended the equipment exhibit as exhibitors' guests where they enjoyed 166 exhibit booths."
"The Awards Presentation, an annual event traditionally taking place following the Get Together Luncheon on Monday of Conference Week, was observed on 29 September with President Kenneth M. Mason presenting the awards listed below to the recipients or their representatives. An especially impressive moment in the Awards Presentation ceremony was the posthumous recognition of the work of Lloyd Thompson, a pioneer in the 16mm and 8mm field by the presentation of the John Grierson International Technical Award, accepted by Mrs. Thompson. — Fourteen newly elected Fellows of the Society received certificates from President Mason. The Award citations and brief biographies of the recipients appear below."
"The 1975 SMPTE Equipment Exhibit was the largest our Society has ever held, with some 160 booths housing 110 exhibitors. Noteworthy was the increase in the amount of video equipment shown (as compared to even two years ago). Among the types of equipment shown were compact cameras and recorders intended for Electronic Newsgathering (IVC, RCA, Sony, Toshiba); editing control systems for helical scan ENG tapes in the U-Matic cartridge format (Convergence Corp., National Video Corp., Sony, Television Research International); compact time-code generator using the SMPTE-sponsored time code (TRI); high-quality production video recording equipment and accessories (Ampex, IVC); an exceptionally compact frame-storage video signal synchronizer (Quantel); and high-quality telecine equipment, including a new 35mm high-speed film projector, a 16mm cartridge film projector, and a state-of-the-art telecine chain with automatic color-balance control (RCA). — An outstanding application of electronic technology to motion-picture technique was seen in the Cinema Product Cinevid system. Here, an extremely small TV camera is used to provide what could be called an electronic viewfinder for a film camera. — The variety of film-editing equipment at the show indicated a high degree of mechanical and optical sophistication and a tendency toward multi-plate and multi-screen operation. — Of the motion-picture equipment on exhibit, there was a significant amount of super-8 hardware in evidence. Although much of this was not new equipment, it had not appeared previously at SMPTE shows. For this reason, we have collected the super-8 equipment in a special category below. — The information for this report was gathered from a variety of sources. Many of the exhibitors were helpful in supplying technical data and summaries about their products. And a number of members attending the Conference took the time to give us their opinions on the show. We are grateful for their help and will look for it again next year."
"THE ACVL experienced its first annual meeting when the ACVL members gathered, along with members of the SMPTE, at the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles on Saturday, September 27."
"For its 10th Annual Winter Television Conference, SMPTE returns to the place where the first one was held, Detroit. The meeting is set for January 23–24 at the Sheraton-Southfield Hotel."
"A Round Table Conference in the form of a dialogue between users and manufacturers of television broadcast equipment was held during the International Television Symposium at Montreux. This report summarizes the proceedings."
"The meeting was called to order by the Chairman at 2:30 p.m. The Executive Director having in his possession 828 signed proxies, a quorum was declared to be present in person and by proxy."
"The brief reports published are intended to reflect the large volume of work being carried on through the SMPTE Engineering Dept. and its committees. For more detailed information on the activities or the individual projects, one should contact Alex E. Alden, Staff Engineer of the SMPTE at headquarters. The Society welcomes participation by specialists from industry in the work of its Engineering Committees and all those who may be interested in exploring the possibility of active membership on any of the committees should contact A. E. Alden or the Engineering Vice-President of the Society. While the Society is in a position to provide the mechanics for the development of National Standards, it relies heavily on the input made available through its Engineering Committee members by industry."
  "For many years these two committees have been responsible respectively for the policy recommendations pertaining to Society publications activity and for the evaluation of prospective manuscripts for publication in the Journal. It was recommended by the Editorial Vice-President that the decisions, plans and activities of these two groups should be publicized in order to elicit an active participation by a greater number of members in the publications effort of the SMPTE."
           "Integrated circuits which can controllably delay an analog signal have been developed and are finding a wide range of applications within the television and recording industry. Where the commonly used charge-transfer devices transfer a sample of the information through a series of storage cells and lose fidelity with each transfer, the devices described here store a sample of information on a given cell and transfer it only once during readout. The two devices treated are a 64-element serial analog memory (SAM-64) and a 100-element serial analog delay (SAD-100). The delay may be thought of as a special case of the memory where independent I/O is not utilized. Both devices are capable of sampling at rates in excess of 10 MHz with SNR better than 55 dB. Applications discussed include time-base correction, drop-out compensation and remotely controllable simulation of cable length."
"Significant improvements in the important performance parameters of a quadruplex recorder, such as video SNR and moire figure, are now attainable through appropriate modification of the video and FM operating parameters of the system. It is now practical by going to “super high band” to achieve at an economical tape speed of 7.5 in/s (19 cm/s) a video performance level equal to that at the normal 15-in/s (38-cm/s) operation and do this without resorting to the use of a high-energy tape. Substantial reduction of residual time base and velocity error and chroma amplitude error can also be achieved by a video pilot correction technique. Use of the video pilot technique enables the quadruplex system to operate with more latitude in the machine setup accuracy and the head-wheel physical tolerances."
"The quality of 35mm optical soundtracks using existing recording and playback techniques is examined. An analysis is made of the capability of the optical medium; it is shown that a flat recording and playback characteristic, together with the use of the Dolby noise reduction system, frees the track from many of the limitations imposed by traditional recording techniques. The new recording and reproduction method offers improved noise figures, better frequency response and lower distortion, yet the optical print is compatible in an unconverted theater. The practical implications of using the new technique throughout the recording chain are discussed."
"The density dependence of the relative output of optical soundtracks, first described by J. A. Maurer, is reviewed. A graph shows the levels of constant relative output vs track densities. A nomograph also relates relative output to track densities. Both the graph and the nomograph are particularly heuristic and useful in understanding the effect the track densities have on relative output. The basic relationship between the densities and the relative output holds for both variable-area and variable-density tracks and for any modulating medium. The method is general and the particular film stock used is not a factor in the way the graph and nomograph are applied. By comparing the relative outputs corresponding to two different density conditions, the resulting change in output can be noted; this is especially useful for soundtrack quality control. Finally, three application examples are given."
"Motion-picture theaters in the USSR continue to enjoy a high degree of popularity. The yearly attendance reached 4.6 billion in 1974, which means that, on the average, each person in the USSR visited a motion-picture theater 18.3 times during the year and 235 new full-length feature films were produced. At present, 690 wide-screen motion-picture theaters and movie halls are equipped for showing films printed on 70mm stock. Some of the films, released in 1974, were photographed on 70mm negative stock and a number of films were enlarged to 70mm positives from 35mm masters."
"The first standard issued in several years by the IEEE Broadcasting Group is IEEE Trial-Use Standard 511-1974 on the Measurement of Linear Waveform Distortion in Video Signal Transmission. This standard formalizes the use of waveform test signals such as the “window signal” and “sine-squared signals” to measure linear distortion in television systems. This paper discusses the scope of the standard and each of the various measurements described in it. Because full agreement on some aspects of the standard were not reached, it was decided to issue the document as a trial-use standard, with the expectation that its use in actual operating situations would allow the disagreements to be resolved. All broadcasters are encouraged to obtain copies of this standard and submit comments on its use to the IEEE."
         "The operation of a TV News department raises a number of unique requirements for the equipment used by film crews. The requirements which this places on lighting equipment includes high performance, efficiency, light weight, compact size, and ruggedness. The HMI [Hydrargyrum (Mercury), M — Medium arc length, I — iodide] lamp was developed to meet the needs of TV news applications. Their application, however, has been limited by problems encountered due to “dark frames” when ac arc fluctuation and film speed are not synchronized. With the introduction of the 200 W HMI lamp and ballasts which eliminate flicker problems, the HMI lamp is gaining wide acceptance for TV news applications."
"Lighting for BBC Outside Broadcasts has developed over the last twenty five years to the extent that well over 50% of all productions transmitted live or recorded by mobile camera units are lit by artificial sources. The problems associated with the high incident light levels for color cameras are reviewed and the increasing use of metal halide luminaires with their high efficacy as means to solving this problem is described. This advancement in technology is particularly relevant today, heightened by escalating costs and the world energy crisis."
"A method of testing the color separation characteristics of television film cameras as well as other types of television pickup equipment is proposed. A special test target printed on standard color positive film is scanned by the television camera under test. The signals at the outputs of the usual red, green and blue amplifier channels of the camera, resulting from scanning three separate color wedges are compared with the signals obtained at the same outputs from scanning a neutral-density step wedge. Experiments demonstrating the validity of this method are described, and the results of the tests together with an evaluation of the accuracy obtained in this manner are presented."
"A new Gevacolor print film has been introduced which, by virtue of its improved graininess relative to Gevacolor print film Type 985, is considered to be especially suitable for reduction printing to small formats. The new film, known as Type 986, retains the excellent sharpness and color rendition of Type 985 print film. The universally known processing sequence based on color developer CD2 with 2-amino-5-diethylaminotoluene monohydrochloride as the developing agent is suitable for Type 986. Processing can also be accomplished with a bleach-fix bath at up to 80°F (26.7°C), and when this is done with super-8 film — with either optical or magnetic soundtracks — total processing time is about 12 min. Sensitometric and modulation transfer curves are given."
"Motion-picture film bases can be rapidly and simply identified by attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy in the region of 4000-650 cm−1. Equipment is described and typical spectra are shown."
"This paper is adapted from a brief oral presentation submitted as a contribution to the papers and discussions on picosecond photography during the 11th International Congress on High-Speed Photography held in London in September 1974. It was presented by J. S. Courtney-Pratt, Head of the Applied Physics and Graphics Systems Dept., Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, NJ 07733; co-author P. M. Rentzepis is Head of the Physical Chemistry Research and Development Dept., Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ 07974."
"For the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft whose missions were to fly by the planet Jupiter and send back scientific information, an on-board instrument called an Imaging Photopolarimeter (IPP) was designed to collect the imaging data. The IPP was produced by a University of Arizona – Santa Barbara Research Center Team. A Pioneer Image Converter System (PICS) was conceived, designed and fabricated at the Optical Sciences Center of the University of Arizona to use part of the digital data transmitted to earth for conversion to NTSC color TV images. The IPP has sensitivity in the spectral bands of red and blue, chosen for scientific reasons; therefore, to make color images in NTSC format, PICS was designed to produce a green signal by processing the red and blue signals separately, in a nonlinear fashion, then mixing them to form the green signal. The three signals are connected to an NTSC color encoder. A color time-base corrector performs the final time-base and color correction to ±3 ns. and to provide a real-time display of imaging data so that the IPP operation could be monitored during the entire Jupiter encounter sequence."
"Of course, with modern technology there is no printing type that gets worn out. But we cannot say “Get thee behind me, Technology.” Technology has long been alongside us. It was there when this Editor's education and erosion began on the rolling farm hills near Lake Ontario. Thus, to reminisce, to bring back what was in the mind long ago:"
               "A new sound negative film, type 258, called ST 8, has been designed to improve the quality of optical soundtracks, especially in the super-8 format. Using an orthochromatic sensitization, a higher sensitivity is obtained with better optical characteristics such as sharpness and graininess, after processing in a conventional phenidone-hydroquinone developer. The higher sensitivity is useful for large film formats. Its increased optical quality results in a remarkable sound quality, especially in super 8. The photographic characteristics, such as darkroom sensitivity, latent image and influence of developing time have been optimized so that the new ST 8 film is readily adapted to any laboratory practice. The results obtained on cross modulation and frequency tests after printing on Gevacolor print film type 985 are discussed."
"Many motion-picture productions now use multiple cameras running simultaneously to obtain different viewpoints of the same events. In other productions, the synchronization of picture and sound is guaranteed by time-code techniques rather than the conventional slating. Both approaches commonly cause problems at the editing table, but practical solutions have now been worked out. The problem of editing multiple-camera films is overcome by cutting together scenes from two of the cameras by using a two-picture, two-soundtrack editing table; scenes from the third and subsequent cameras can then be cut in in the same way. The problem of picture/sound synchronization may be dealt with by an IRT-Munich technique of optically marking - on both picture area and soundtrack — coded information (using an 8-4-2-1 binary-coded-decimal code) giving at one-second intervals the exact time (second, minute, hour, day, month and year) and camera identification. Increased ease and speed of editing are assured."
"A computerized system has been developed for determining the chemical cost and efficiency of operation of a motion-picture processing laboratory's chemical departments. A monthly cost analysis report is produced that shows also the BOD5 contribution of each solution, based on actual use, and compared to the laboratory's internal standards. The reports show the actual and aim use of each chemical. The actual cost of the chemical is compared to the so-called standard cost and the actual BOD5 is compared to the standard value. The BOD5 load of all chemicals is totaled and divided by the monthly water consumption thus giving a realistic value of the laboratory's BOD5 discharge. This technique has been in use for over two years, and the accuracy has been validated by independent laboratory analysis."
"The cloud physics camera and optical system described here was originally developed for use in 1975 on the joint American-Soviet Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) to investigate salt particle breakup, particle acceleration, and cloud formation in a zero-gravity environment. Lack of room and priority resulted in its exclusion from the ASTP mission along with many other worthy experiments. However, in view of the current broad interest in cloud-physics experimentation in zero-gravity (with a long-range view toward atmospheric pollution abatement and weather control), it seems that the progress made in developing these relatively simple, low-cost solutions to photographic and data-reading problems inherent in such experimentation should be published to aid others working in similar or related projects. For the four basic problem areas there are relatively simple, low-cost solutions; these as well as secondary problem areas of potentially broad interest and their solutions are described."
"A very compact and lightweight portable color video recorder/camera system, known as the Akai VTS-150, has been getting increased attention in the North American market over the last 1½ years. The VTS-150 includes the VT-150 ¼-in portable color VTR and color processor, the VC-150 camera and the VA-150 combined ac adaptor and battery charger. Two rechargeable lead-acid 6-V batteries provide power for up to 40 min of operation, and a 5-in (12.7-cm) reel of videotape provides a 26-min taping capability. One important feature that is unique among portable systems is the VTS-150's assemble-edit capability. Important specifications include: camera horizontal resolution of more than 300 lines; SNR of better than 40 dB; and not counting the ac adaptor, a weight of 22¼ 1b (10.1 kg). Although it is not reasonable to compare the VTS-150 with much larger and vastly more expensive systems, it is nevertheless considered a remarkable achievement and a valuable tool in electronic journalism."
"The increasing use in Europe of floodlighting and spotlighting equipment employing metal halide discharge lamps on exteriors for shooting either color film or color television has resulted in a corresponding decrease in the use of conventional incandescent lighting equipment and carbon arcs. ORTF (French Television) has by now acquired considerable experience in using lighting units with metal halide lamps of 575, 1200, 2500 and 4000 watts. The advantages of metal halide lamps include high luminous efficacy, high correlated color temperature (approximating to daylight) and small physical dimensions. The disadvantages are the delay in re-striking, unless the lamp is still moderately hot, and the fact that conventional dimming cannot be used, at any rate for the present. Up to recent times, the flicker or “beat” obtained in the course of filming was a problem, but recent developments give every hope that this has now been resolved. Several kinds of available lighting units are described."
"In 1967 Bartleson and Breneman applied experimental results of scaled brightness perceptions in complex fields to the analysis of image tone reproduction (Jour. Opt. Soc. Am., 57: 953, 1967). Other workers have suggested the use of brightness perception data obtained with simple-field viewing conditions for tone reproduction analysis. There are, however, significant differences between the perceptual functions for simple- and complex-field viewing. This paper describes the effects of one such difference on the estimation of optimum tone reproduction gradients. It is shown that the complex-field data relate more realistically to tone reproduction requirements in that they accord better with independent, empirical results found in the study of optimum tone reproduction. A simplified expression for predicting relative brightnesses in complex images is proposed for use in studies of tone reproduction."
"From 17 March to 22 March 1975, IEC Technical Committee (TC) 60 – Recording, and its subcommittees, held meetings in Paris, France. The preceding meeting of TC 60 was in 1973 in Munich, F. R. Germany. The three subcommittees of TC 60 are SC 60A – Sound Recording, SC 60B – Video Recording, and SC 60C – Educational Equipment Using Recording. This report deals with the meetings of SC 60B – Video Recording."
"The third meeting of SC6OC was held in Paris during the meeting of IEC/TC60 under the able leadership of Chairman Raymond Wyman of the University of Massachusetts and Secretary Wim Koeter of the Netherlands. Twenty-six delegates from 10 countries took part in the work of this subcommittee."
              "The first permanent installation of a television frame synchronizer in the U.S. and the successful processing of various types of signals for broadcast are discussed. The frame synchronizer is well suited to overcoming problems in video switching due to: videotape servo instabilities, Doppler effects in satellite video distribution and instantaneous event integration without genlock in electronic journalism. It has become a powerful and valuable tool for the broadcaster."
"A new television frame synchronizer has been developed by employing the latest digital techniques to eliminate the problems associated with maintaining synchronization by the use of extremely stable rubidium timing standards, or with genlocking two or more sync generators. The synchronizer solves technical problems resulting from the handling of a nonsynchronous video signal from multiple remote sources and various studios, and it permits expanding program production techniques, as well as introducing savings in operating expenses. Eight-bit A/D and D/A converters are used with sufficient digital memory (approximately 3 megabits) and associated circuits. The resultant output signal is completely synchronized with the local reference sources in frequency and phase."
 "An experimental communications satellite will be launched later this year to flight-test various subsystems and to investigate the applications throughout society. By agreement in 1971 between Canadian and U.S.A. agencies, Canada is responsible for designing and building the spacecraft and the U.S.A. for supplying the high-power traveling-wave tube, launch vehicle and environmental test and operational support. The investigation will (1) flight-test and evaluate a traveling-wave tube with an efficiency greater than 50% and a saturated power output of 200 W at a frequency of 12 GHz; (2) flight-test a lightweight extendible solar array with an initial power output greater than 1 kW; (3) flight-test a 3-axis stabilization system; and (4) experiment with the use of the 12- and 14-GHz bands. Almost a score of agencies, universities and hospitals will participate in this experiment."
"An experimental broadcasting satellite system for community reception in Japan is described mainly from the broadcaster's point of view. A national study was initiated with the long-range view of (a) solving reception difficulties, a problem which NHK has to work out in such areas as mountains, remote islands and building-shadowed places; and (b) providing for more educational channels. A national-level study was initiated by taking a first step consisting of an experimental satellite to examine the technical feasibility and determine the most suitable system. For transmission of two color television channels, a 350-kg satellite will cover this island nation with a shaped-beam antenna with 58 dBW/ch maximum EIRP. This would allow the use of a 500 K-receiver input circuit, a 1.6-m antenna for the central service area and a 4.5-m antenna for the outer service area."
"Typical parameters for individual and community earth stations capable of receiving TV transmission from a Communications Technology Satellite (CTS) (which is to use a 200-W traveling-wave tube) are considered in order to determine what is now feasible and what may become so over the coming decade. The state of the art in broadcasting-satellite ground receivers is reviewed in regard to antennas, microwave integrated circuits, surface-acoustic-wave devices, field-effect transistors and parametric amplifiers. Receiver models considered are of a type suitable for Canadian application, i.e. one or two television channels selectable by tuning, plus one of two audio channels (switched) in the case of individual receivers, and up to six simultaneous television channels, each with two audio, in the case of community receivers. It is concluded that, for economic reasons, direct-to-home broadcasting from satellites will not be a commercial proposition by the early 1980s although some forms of satellite-to-community broadcasting could be operating."
"Due to international regulations and agreements, the broadcasting satellite service will develop as a limited-area service. Thus, narrow-beam transmissions will be the rule in that service. There are, in addition, technical reasons making narrow beams preferable. On both regulatory and technical grounds, it is important that such beams be as small as possible. A method is presented for finding a minimum ellipse touching at least three points on the perimeter of a given region on earth. Minimization of spillover radiation into neighboring territories is also discussed as the choice of the aforementioned three perimetric points affects it."
             "The problems and pitfalls of exposure determination for reversal color films using ASA or DIN exposure index values are briefly discussed. A new system is described which permits the cameraman to establish by means of simple tests, which he can carry out by himself, the exposure latitude of a given film and the minimum and maximum photometric values which can be reproduced appropriately by the film. A light box and stepwedge in conjunction with a spot light meter are used for this purpose. Examples for practical production procedures are given. The test-exposure equipment is described in detail. The influence of making reversal duplicates from the camera original on the exposure necessary for the camera original is considered and the effects of “flashing” and “pushing” the original are illustrated. The use of color temperature correction filters within the K-rating system is described. The conclusion is reached that a reliable and simple exposure determination system can be established using purely photometric values and without recourse to standardized exposure indexes, such as ASA or DIN values."
 "The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (CBC) utilizes the Canadian Domestic Satellite System to distribute three television channels throughout Canada via ANIK-1, the world's first synchronous-orbit domestic satellite, and a network of 33 earth stations. A Network Control System has been developed to provide the CBC with centralized remote control over the routing of channels to specific areas of the country or the accessing of satellite channels by different transmitting stations. With dual identical control centers — in Toronto (English Network) and Montreal (French Network) — either control center is able to control any earth station in the network to feed regions or specific locations with the desired channel, to control the audio/video output feeds to given regions or communities at the beginning and end of the broadcast day (or to blank out commercial messages), and to control the origination point of the program for any given satellite channel by turning transmitters on and off."
"The conventional way of transmitting television sound information on subcarriers leads to a number of difficulties in satellite communications systems using frequency modulation, because of the limited power available. In particular, when high-quality sound is required, modulation products can only be avoided by going to large bandwidths and high power compared with the actual picture transmission — and this is expensive. A method has been found for transmitting two high-quality (15-kHz bandwidth and better than 60-dB SNR) sound signals with no mutual interference between sound and video signals. No additional RF bandwidth and little additional power is required. The technique involves using a part of the line-blanking interval after shortening the synchronizing pulse. The sound signals are sampled and companded to a given number of bits in a non-return-to-zero code. At the receiving end the pulses are stored, decoded and read out with the original sampling frequency. After passing through a low-pass filter, the signals are available in the original position. Tests have been promising, and a practical application seems possible soon."
"The development of high-pressure discharge lamps over the years has been aimed at improving color rendering, efficiency and life. The compact-source iodide (CSI) lamp was initially developed in 400-W and 1,000-W ratings for projector applications, but it was the new demands of outside broadcast color television in 1969 that led to the introduction of this lamp housed in a PAR-64 sealed-beam globe for floodlighting sports stadia from high corner towers. Sports areas with sidelighting were not so well suited to the use of the symmetrical beam CSI floodlights, so another metal halide lamp was introduced — this one with an unjacketed linear arc tube — in 750-W and 1,600-W ratings. For filming, the 1-kW lamp performs exceptionally well as a fill-in source with daylight. At 90 lm/W, it is five to six times more efficient than tungsten-halogen lamps used with blue filters to correct the daylight; four lamps are approximately equivalent to a 225-A brute arc. Control gear is being made simpler and more versatile, and the problem of “beat,” which is already controllable in filming situations, is expected to be overcome completely with techniques now being developed."
"Photographing the smoke plume from an industrial source is the simplest technique for determining its height. Photography is economical and provides a permanent record of the momentary shape of the plume. Such information is valuable in planning control of an area's air quality. In this technique a single camera is used, then the data obtained are analyzed. Several interesting features of the smoke plumes can be observed and recorded photographically. The procedures are set forth and the merits of the use of the technique in studying environmental problems and the errors to be expected in the measurements are examined."
              "The charge to this working group is to develop colorimetric measurement methods and specifications for television studio/field camera systems. The colorimetric characteristics of color television systems are based on the assumption of a specific set of reproducing primaries. Thus, the colorimetric characteristics of the display devices, that is, color monitors and receivers, must be defined before we can develop camera specifications."
"The final soundtrack master of a motion picture, when heard in the studios dubbing room, ideally represents the quality of sound that should be reproduced in the theater. Unfortunately there has been no standard of theater performance that could be objectively implemented. The methods that have been employed are subjective. Within the last few years an acoustic response technique has been developed employing a pink noise input and a measurement of the resultant sound pressure levels in the auditorium. This objective method permits the adjustment of a theater's reproducing system to match that of the dubbing room to within an acceptable tolerance. Measurements of Hollywood dubbing rooms and review rooms and of the Academy Award theater have established an acoustic response curve for dubbing rooms and for theaters. These curves have been submitted to the SMPTE for consideration as American standards. In view of similar work going on in other countries, the acoustic response of dubbing rooms and theaters is being considered by the International Standards Organization (ISO) for international standardization."
"The mass production of super-8 copies with an optical soundtrack started in Europe about 1970. Since then, a much better quality of the sound as well as of the image has been achieved through the improvement of the characteristics of the raw stock, improvement of the processing methods and improved quality control. A report on the state of the art at that time was given at the 1973 Audio Engineering Society Conference in Rotterdam. Since then further successful research has resulted in reducing the background noise of super-8 optical soundtracks by means of the Dolby-B method. A report on the subject was presented by the author at the 1974 AES Conference in Copenhagen."
"A new kind of vidicon-type camera tube, called the Chalnicon,*™ has been successfully developed, using CdSe photoconductor as a target material. It has these features: Its photosensitivity is as high as 10 to 20 times that of ordinary Sb2S3 vidicons; its spectral response covers the entire visible spectrum, making it most useful as a color TV camera tube; and its low dark current, high resolution and lack of after-image are indispensable characteristics. Presented are the characteristics of several tubes in a variety of tube diameters (18-mm and 25-mm) and electrode configurations (magnetic-focus/magnetic-deflection and electrostatic-focus/magnetic-deflection). Newly developed low-lag tubes are also discussed."
"Many difficulties in planning and installing remote control and automation equipment — especially concerning larger broadcasting centers — arise out of the nonuniformity and variety of control signals and devices. Usually the installed extensive cable-networks show very poor efficiency. These disadvantages can be avoided by using a serial data bus system, in which coaxial bus lines transmitting control, back indication and distribution informations are looped through all control panels and all equipment of the studio."
"High-speed photographic techniques have been used to record the aerodynamics of natural hailstones falling near the ground. Two photographic systems were employed: a high-speed 16mm camera with two 1,200-W light sources and a pair of motor-driven 35mm cameras with stroboscopic illumination. Exposure time had to be on the order of 100 μs or less with Tri-X film. Both systems were powered by a portable 3-kW gasoline-powered generator. One or the other of these systems was deployed in several hailstorms during the summers of 1973 and 1974. The photographed stones were allowed to impact in a sawdust-filled box and were stored in a portable freezer for subsequent analysis. A hailpad consisting of a styrofoam square covered with aluminum foil was also set out during the photography to record size distributions and collision energies. Some preliminary results obtained for the films, the advantages and disadvantages of the two systems, and the techniques used to facilitate high-speed photography under the adverse conditions typical of severe hailstorms are examined."
"“Motion-Picture Film Widths” by Kemp R. Niver in the Journal for August 1968, pp. 814–818, gave us the interesting history with illustrations of all the different dimensions used in cinematography since the beginning in 1891 to about 1930."
"From the days of silent films, to disc, then optical sound, to Cinema-Scope, stereo, 3-D, and Cinerama, the technology employed in screen entertainment has always reached out to achieve total involvement of the audience."
         "Among the many efforts now being made to improve the picture quality in color television using film as a source, one of the most promising approaches is scanning directly the color negative and broadcasting an edited videotape from the negative, instead of the usual positive print on film. This approach results in improved gradation, color fidelity, steadiness and resolution. In addition to these advantages, this method makes unnecessary the time-consuming task of negative matching or conformation. A sophisticated system has been developed which simplifies the editing process and can reduce to at least 25% the time and manpower customarily required for production of a finished program. The work is automated by using self-threading random-access film-to-tape transfer equipment, a remote-controlled quadruplex VTR and a minicomputer. Other features of the system include a unique electronic color-timing system and a newly developed scanning-projector which can be loaded with ten 1,200-ft (366-m) reels of 16mm film in simultaneous storage."
"A high-quality, yet inexpensive system for recording, playing back and analyzing video images of moving objects at selectable slow rates is described. The system records monochrome images on a thin circular polyester sheet with a magnetic coating and can display real-time, slow-motion and stop-action views of motions lasting from a small fraction of a second up to 10 s. As the sheet rotates, an air cushion is created with such dynamics that the sheet stretches to generate the necessary head-to-sheet contact pressure, the video is recorded on the sheet in a continuous spiral track by a record/reproduce head that moves radially across the rotating sheet at a synchronous speed during the record mode. In playback, the head moves either synchronously or incrementally at preselected rates. Two independent stationary heads, located at the periphery of the sheet and at opposite sides, are used to record and reproduce a single field of the video signal from the main head during stop- and slow-motion operation. The mechanical and electronic subsystems of the recorder are described along with a special strobe light and a rotating-shutter video camera designed to complement the system. Two applications among the many possible are discussed: a pulsed x-ray system for medical diagnosis and the Sports Clinic System as it is used for analyzing and perfecting a golf swing."
"A narrow-band television system for space observation utilizing an image-memory tube has been developed and used as a finder system for a balloon-borne solar telescope. Slow-scan video signal from the camera or FM receiver is supplied to a slow-scan monitor. The pictures on the screen are recorded by a motor-driven 35mm film camera. The slow-scan pictures are converted to the standard scanning rate by a scan converter with two memory tubes. This system has been used with 15,000 m3 balloons since 1971 as a finder system for a balloon-borne solar telescope jointly with a group of the Tokyo Astronomical Observatory, University of Tokyo. The image of the telescope is divided by a half mirror. One optical path is for an on-board motor- driven film camera. The other is for the television camera. The usefulness of the television system as a real-time finder was proved by the test flight in 1971 using a 48-mm-diam solar telescope. In 1972 and 1973, 100-mm-diam and 17-m composite-focal-length solar telescope was used to make photographs of the solar surface."
"Over the years many inquiries have come from motion-picture laboratories about slitting processed motion-picture film. There are four common inquiries that involve the areas of width control, rough edges, dirt, and a relatively new one, products on polyester support as opposed to products on the more traditional triacetate support. Slitting processed film on either triacetate or polyester support to obtain good width control, relative freedom from dirt, and smooth edges should not be too difficult. Commercial equipment is available which can do a satisfactory job for the motion-picture laboratory. However, these slitters require periodic maintenance, particularly in the cutting area itself."
"This report on Film '75 is the work of one author who attended both as a participant and an observer. Because of the number of concurrent activities at the meeting, this report should not be construed as presenting a comprehensive view of Film '75 in its entirety. The author was asked to prepare this report after the close of the conference and so had little opportunity to gather material for a complete in-depth report. The report reflects the general ambience of Film '75 as well as the author's evaluation of the sessions and events which he attended. We are indebted to him for his efforts."
                     "IEEE Std 167-1966. Test Procedure for Facsimile was based on previous issues of the IEEE Test Chart."
 "These recommendations apply to loudspeakers and loudspeaker systems. The recommendations define terms associated with loudspeakers and their testing, recommend methods of testing on which there is general agreement, and indicate preferred methods of presenting information regarding their characteristics. They involve physical, steady-state measurements only. Methods of measurement are stated in such a manner as to constitute recommendations to competent technical personnel acquainted with current practices in electroacoustical measurements."
"This standard pertains to small low-power pulse transformers for use in electronic equipment, transmitting peak power of 300 W or less and average power of 5 W or less with a peak working voltage of 1000 V or less. These transformers are required to transform unipolar or bipolar pulses of voltage or current within specified tolerances of amplitude and time when operated between specified impedances. This standard is not intended to include low-power \"switching\" type pulse transformers which are covered in IEEE Std 272-1970, Standard for Computer-Type (SquareLoop) Pulse Transformers. These transformers depend upon the use of \"square-loop\" core material for operation, have \"memory\" capability, and normally transmit only bipolar pulses unless provision is made for core flux reset. This standard is not intended to include transformers for power conversion applications. Those transformers will be covered in a related standard. Whenever numerical values are indicated they may be considered as recommended values. Section 2 contains definitions of terms pertaining primarily to functional testing of low-power pulse transformers, and Section 5 contains equivalent circuits and definitions of associated terms. Section 6 describes preferred transformer test methods and the appendix contains alternate test methods."
"All of the terms and definitions in this document have been taken from current IEEE standards on nuclear power generating stations. The source of each definition is indicated by a number in brackets immediately following the definition in Section 1, and full listings of each standard follow in Section 2. As defined herein, the terms are restricted to the manner in which they have been employed in mentioned standards, and the definitions may not, in all cases, be applicable for broader usage. However, because the IEEE standards on nuclear power generating stations have had wide acceptance within both government and industry, the terms, as used in these documents, have come into broad usage by many persons who neither need the standards nor have ready access to them. Since these terms are not included in American National Standard Glossary of Terms in Nuclear Science and Technology, Nl.1-1967, the present document has been published as a convenient method of supplementing that standard."
"Proper installation design and installation procedures are prerequisite to long and reliable serviceof large stationary lead storage batteries. A definite need exists within the industry for recommendations that provide a uniform method for the design of the installation and the installation procedures of all batteries to meet station requirements. However, to provide practices that can be used immediately (especially for nuclear power generating stations), this document will limit its scope to the installation design and installation procedures of large stationary lead storage batteries. Included will be the seismic considerations for new battery installations."
"This standard sets forth the requirements for a calibration program to control and verify the accuracy of M&TE (measuring and test equipment) which is used to assure that important parts of nuclear power generating stations are in conformance with prescribed technical requirements, and that data provided by testing, inspection, or maintenance are valid. These important parts include those structures, systems, and components whose satisfactory performance is required; for the plant to operate safely, to prevent accidents that could cause undue risk to the health and safety of the public, or to mitigate the consequences of such accidents if they were to occur. This standard is intended to be used in conjunction with American National Standard Quality Assurance Program Requirements for Nuclear Power Plants, ANSI N45.2-1971."
"This standard is intended to serve as a basis for a range of modular instrumentation capable of interfacing transducers and other devices to digital controllers for data and control. It consists of mechanical standards and signal standards that are sufficient to ensure physical and operational compatibility between units regardless of source."
"When machine parameters are expressed in a properly selected per-unit system, the parameters of a wide range of machine sizes fall into relatively narrow ranges even though the actual values of these same parameters may vary over extremely wide ranges. The per-unit system thereby makes possible an easy comparison between different machines, essentially independent of size, without the use of conversion factors, and facilitates the identification of gross calculation errors. The proper selection of base values is fundamental to the usefulness of a per-unit system. Although per-unit quantities have been used for many years by designers of rotating machinery, the base quantities were not standardized, and it was necessary to define them in each publication. A working group of the Rotating Machinery Committee was created to propose a set of standard definitions. In 1961, a proposed standard (AIEE No. 86) was published for trial use. A critical review of that proposed standard has resulted in this present standard."

"The findings and conclusions of the study described in this paper can be summarized as follows: 1. The conductor cracking of the initial design of the flex circuit is inherent in this design. 2. The redesign for increased stiffness of the flex circuit is an improvement by about a factor of two over the problematic initial design, but falls short of providing an adequate minimum flex life of 20 cycles. 3. The redesign for increased flexibility of the flex circuit has a flex life improvement by about a factor of 20 over the initial design and exceeds the minimum flex life requirement by at least a factor of four. 4. The above conclusions are supported by both analytical and experimental results, which are in excellent agreement with each other."
"Addition cure polyimide materials made from Kerimid 601 resin are easily fabricated into multilayer boards using processes and equipment normally intended for epoxy boards."
"As is the case with conventionally cured coatings, there is no ideal UV curable material. In fact, because of its relative infancy, the selection of these resins is limited. Nevertheless, using commercially available systems and curing equipment, a wide enough spectrum of properties can be obtained, either with individual resins or blends, to meet requirements for selected applications. A judicious tradeoff of properties, in conjunction with a realistic set of acceptability criteria, will allow advantage to be taken of the unique processing features of UV curable resins."
"The new photopolymer solder mask described here combines the properties of photographic selectivity, mechanical strength, and ease of reproducible application. It provides improved circuit protection during soldering operations and subsequent handling. The new solder mask offers substantial cost and performance advantages over screened masks to designers, printed wiring board fabricators, component assemblers, and end users."
"The objective in developing and producing this cable-connector system has been to satisfy the needs of digital high speed systems in an economical fashion. The ribbon coaxial cable with its mass stripping and mass terminating techniques has eliminated a great deal of labor content over previous available methods. The cable and its attendant connectors provide excellent electrical capability to meet the design requirements of the equipment."
"Stable electrical and mechanical interconnections can be made within the extreme tolerance limits of ±0.003″ of a specified hole diameter. Specifically, resistance value changes of less than 1 mΩ were obtained after all environmental tests and retention forces were maintained above 12 Ibs. Properly repaired pins had similar maximum resistance changes and minimum retention forces. For all but one resilient cross-section pin, maximum removal forces of over 50 Ibs. were obtained, so repair procedures must be carefully planned. These tests indicate that these limits are viable provided that (a) the drilled hole dimension is specified and controlled to within ± 0.001, (b) the diagonal of the contact is controlled to ±0.001, (c) copper plating shall be minimum 0.001″, (d) the hole size after copper plating shall insure a minimum 0.002″ interference fit, (e) solder plating should not be used to close the gap of tolerance limits unless all previous requirements have been met. Any proposed deviation from these recommendations would have to be justified on the basis of other tests."
"Despite its wide use and long history as a metal joining technique, soldering until today remains as much an art as a science. Although there are some general characteristics that can be used to describe a good solder joint or fillet, no precise definition of a good solder fillet exists. With the increasing application of mass soldering methods for manufacturing large numbers of identical parts, it becomes desirable to have a precise definition of a good solder fillet. Such information would be useful in quality control and component design and it would also contribute to the basic understanding of soldering. An analytical model based on the balance of surface tension and pressure forces in solder at the molten state is formulated to predict fillet shapes. The paper deals mainly with the fillet formed by a pin and the land area of a plated-through-hole. The model can also be adopted to other geometries."
"A model for axisymmetric solder fillets is presented in Part I (1). Another general class of configuration is the two dimensional fillet such as the fillets formed by a terminal pin laying on a flat land area or a “Tee” joint. The model is also extended to calculate the fillets formed between a square wire wrap terminal and the land areas of a plated-through-hole (PTH). The application of these results to the design of a wire wrap terminal and the choices of preform sizes is also discussed."
"This paper primarily comprises excerpts of the work done under our regular undergraduate teaching program. The material is organized into subject groupings with the intention of presenting in convenient form sufficient information for making high quality thick film portable devices. The work emphasizes problems and methods of solving the construction of a thick film digital wrist-watch prototype, using a new PtAg. ink and a novel procedure to fabricate thick film multilayer structures with unusually high line densities associated with increased yield as compared with previously known methods."
"Test data and field experience have shown that the Multiwire technology as compared to multilayer technology provides a means of achieving high connectivity with equally high reliability."
"Those having responsibility for packaging electrical/electronic circuits for products can utilize batch or parallel treatment of components to obtain vast increases in productivity. But to do so compromises in overall structural design must be made to aIlow-arrangement of components in orderly patterns and access for installation of such components en masse into products on the production line."
"It has been seen that the requirements of various automotive electronic systems can dictate distinct packaging approaches. The Theft Deterrent and Lamp Monitor systems required low cost and ease of assembly into the vehicle. In addition, because they are optional systems, the fewer deviations from the standard build sequence the better. Thus electronic modules integrated into wiring assemblies were employed. In the Seat Belt/Starter Interlock system, the logistics of part supply and concern for ruggedness were of prime importance. Thus a separate package relatively impervious to assembly plant handling was employed."
"The piezoelectric voltages measured under the described conditions are relatively low and would not cause a problem in most applications. It is possible, however, that these voltages could affect the performance of microcircuits that operate at very low power levels. Test equipment that would measure current or power outputs as well as voltage would yield more information. Also a test setup capable of producing much higher shock levels would yield data more representative of the environments to which many potted devices are subjected. The following general conclusions can be drawn from the data: • In all test configurations, higher shock levels produced higher voltage outputs. • The distance between conductive paths in the potted test specimens had no significant effect on the voltage generated. • A silicone conformal coating applied to an embedded assembly will reduce the voltage generated at a given shock level. • Filled systems produced lower peak voltages than the same resin/hardener systems without filler."
"Gas pressure inside a spacecraft decreases rapidly when continuum flow exists. During molecular flow the internal pressure decreases slowly due to the outgassing of the spacecraft structural, electrical and other materials. Non-pressurized, conformally coated high voltage circuits must be de-energized until the gas pressure is less than that which can support partial discharges and probable arc-over corona, as shown in Fig. 7."
"Display technology has recently developed at a rapid rate-largely due to the phenominal growth of the calculator market. Planar gas discharge displays offer an excellent combination of low cost, large character size, high reliability, multiplexing capability, aesthetics, etc. but have been held back by the lack of an available inexpensive interface. The gas discharge display is a long way from obscurity, and the availability of the Series UDN-6100 digit drivers and the Series UDN-7100 segment drivers should open up new areas while satisfying the needs of existing applications as well."
"A significant fraction of semiconductor devices utilize organic materials for passivation and/or encapsulation. However, we are far from understanding the effect of chemical composition and structure of these materials on device reliability during high temperature electrical stress testing. The selection of junction coating resins has remained an empirical art."
"Extensive reliability evaluation of plastic encapsulated transistors and microcircuits at Fort Monmouth and by vendors and commercial users of these devices, has revealed at least three major problem areas: 1. Bond Integrity 2. Moisture Resistance 3. Salt Atmosphere Sensitivity"
"The term “integrated optics” was coined, in analogy with integrated electronic circuits, to describe a network of optical devices (such as sources, modulators, switches and detectors) on a single substrate joined by optical waveguides. Although much interesting and exciting research is in progress, we are far from realizing this concept today, even in the most rudimentary fonn. We are perhaps at the stage that integrated circuits were 15 or 20 years ago. Work is being done on suitable thin-film and diffused waveguide materials and on individual-unintegrated-devices in a planar waveguide geometry. Much of this work is summarized in a Special Issue of IEEE Trans., MTT 23, January 1975."
"Two resistor compatible multilayer dielectrics have been formulated, #4901, for high temperature firing, and #4903 for firing temperatures as low as 780°C. Both give small changes in resistivity and temperature coefficient of resistance, compared to the same resistors on bare alumina, for at least two ruthenium based resistor systems."
"Untrimmed Ni-Cr resistors on glazed alumina substrates, hermetically sealed in a dry nitrogen atmosphere, survive and remain stable when subjected to power densities greater 2000 W/in2. Large (>7 × 10−4in2) resistors with standard top-hat trimming fail at less than 1000 W/in2 due to hot spots, however, a change in trim line configuration results in stable resistors at greater than 1200 W/in2. Resistance-time characteristics depend on mean resistor temperature, which increases (at a given power density) as the square root of resistor area. Results predict, e.g., that all resistors in a 3/8 × 3/8 × 0.080 inch (0.5W) package can be powered at 2000 W/in2 for several years before a 1 percent resistance change is experienced. The resistor area for such a configuration, 2.5 × 10−4in2, is 50 times less than that required with the present power density design value of 40 W/in2. Resistors deposited on unglazed alumina are even more stable than those deposited on glazed alumina because of their lower operating temperature."
"The selection of a solder glass must be empirically determined from the application constraints, due to the rate dependency of certain physical parameters. A glass which gives excellent fabrication of television picture tubes (one of the first applications of solder glasses), where slow heating rates are employed, might have little application to package technology."
"Storage life of epoxy adhesives is a valuable tool to determine its stability in air; however, 1000 hours storage at 150°C is insufficient for complete evaluation of materials. It is suggested that 2000 hours minimum temperature storage should be adopted for evaluation of epoxies for hybrid microelectronic use."
"A new process utilizing a specially developed high-temperature Insulating Tape System was described. The physical characteristics of the insulating layer were listed and the preparation of a highly flexible system suitable for wire winding was described. Several application possibilities were mentioned; in these the new system showed excellent results as compared to previous techniques."
"Figures I through 6 illustrate typical thermal characteristics of some wire and cable components. Each material used in the many wire constructions has a normal pattern for a thermogram. Some materials, like polyethylene, show very marked thermal changes when internal transitions such as melting occur. Other materials, including a few types of rubber, require careful technique and high instrument sensitivity to detect transition during a thermal scan. When a transition pattern for a given material is not as expected, it may give very useful information about a cure or compounding problem. Other test or analytical tools may be needed to resolve a problem, but thermal analysis provides an excellent source of evaluation data for many materials."
"The combination of production shortages, and scarcity of some feedstocks and other raw materials, means that some of the more traditional resins could continue to be in short supply. Even the most optimistic projections forecast a continuing imbalance between growing demand and diminishing supply. This paper has attempted to show that alternative materials are available that will compensate in some way. The present situation, although unfortunate, could create some new and exciting developments in this fast growing electronic market."
"Although silicone dielectric gels have been employed in microcircuit packaging applications for more than a decade, there has been a lack of information in the literature to aid a potential user. This report provides an overview of how silicone dielectric gels are used, with special emphasis on quality control test procedures and cure system limitations."
"It has been established that the arc plasma process can be used to fabricate ferrite phasors. The resultant ferrite-dielectric composite, except for the coercive force, has excellent microwave device characteristics. With the advent of a dielectric possessing optimum temperature coefficient of expansion, a phasor can be arc plasma sprayed which will be economical and exhibit the required device performance for phased arrays. The greatest economic impact of the arc plasma is expected to be in phasors requiring thin ferrite walls, since these are more difficult to fabricate by current processes and can be arc plasma fabricated at rapid rates. It should be noted that to achieve low cost phasors with the arc plasma technique, massive production numbers of phasors (in excess of 100,000 units) (6), are not required. That is, one can arc plasma fabricate a relatively small number of phasors and still maintain the economics of this technique."
"The electrical performance of these films is quite satisfactory for all applications of metallizations. The adherence of these films matches or exceeds the intrinsic strengths of the commercial substrates presently available. It is likely that both metallizations can pass the −30 to +85°C mil specs. Both will respond well to hermetic encapsulation in helium."
"The control of microwave signals. by electrical devices that employ ferrimagnets as the source of the device action, remains a highly specialized discipline. Together, the electrical engineer and material scientist process these metal oxide insulators as ceramic bodies or single crystals and translate their intrinsic magnetic and dielectric properties into useful device phenomena. Because the interaction between the microwave signal and the ferrimagnetic medium takes place over the entire ferrite volume, the geometry of the ferrite plays as important a role as does its intrinsic magnetic and dielectric properties. These concepts will be discussed in terms of the range of technical characteristics of the major types of ceramic ferrimagnets that are available today for microwave device applications."
"Screening and qualification testing per MIL-M-38510 and MILSTD-883 are not cost effective for MIC procurements due to the custom nature, high cost and low volume production of these devices. A cost effective program is proposed to insure the quality and reliability of MIC devices."
"An hermetically sealed launcher (Figure 1) is intended to join planar circuit structures (microstripline) inside a microwave enclosure to standard coaxial connectors/cable outside the enclosure. Many microwave integrated circuit (MIC) components are deposited on the planar circuit structures without individual protection. Therefore, the entire planar circuit structure must be sealed from the ambient environments since these environments could degrade the performance of the MIC components. An hermetically scaled package is used to protect the circuit structure, necessitating hermetically sealed coaxial connectors (launchers) to permit connection of external microwave transmission lines."
"A thin, resistance-welded cover provides a cost effective (microwave-box) seal with the following attributes: 1. Covers are lower priced because dimensions are not tightly toleranced. 2. Cover alignment is not critical. 3. Box edges may be irregular or damaged without affecting the seal quality. 4. Rework is fast and simple. S. Seals are hermetic. 6. Internal isolation can be made by welding the cover to baffles. 7. Commercial equipment is available for weld sealing. An electrode change is the only modification required. 8. Operator training is minimal."
"The versatility of the use of powdered resins has been demonstrated in a variety of commercially accepted applications. The major areas of use can be categorized into three market areas (1) metal finishing or decorative (2) corrosion protection and (3) electrical insulation. In all three market areas, the types of powdered resin used, thermoplastics or thermosetting, are dependent upon the end use requirements."
"The CIV of 18 AWG heavy build film insulated magnet wire is approximately 200 volts/mil at room temperature. Elevated temperature and aging time may reduce the CIV by over 50% depending on material, temperature, and specimen configuration."
"We have developed life tests which seem to be sensitive to the effect of blistering, and have found that effect to be minor for polyesterimide wire treated with acrylic varnish. This is confirmed by the continued success of this combination in actual service."
"The history of the hermetic motor industry is one of conservatism. Due to the high reliability required of the hermetic system and the tremendous replacement costs of an inadequate system, manufacturers tend to stick with an established system rather than initiate change. When a change is finally initiated, it is only after thorough study and testing have shown that said change will not be detrimental to the hermetic system. General Electric Hermetic Motor Product Department, although a leader in initiating improvements in the hermetic motor industry, is no exception to this rule and the tests we use to evaluate a varnish for hermetic use are described in this paper. The paper will not attempt an industry wide survey of varnish evaluation techniques, but will deal only with those tests used by the General Electric Hermetic Motor Products Department."
"Since the invention of the hermetic system by placing the motor inside the compressor case, motor reliability has been even more important for at least three reasons. First, the motor and its insulation system must resist the chemical effects of the refrigerant and the compressor lubrication oils. Second, the motor became considerably less accessible and therefore, very costly to replace and service. Third, if a failure does occur, the destruction of motor construction materials such as copper, steel, and insulation components can cause large quantities of foreign materials to be deposited within the system. These reasons don't even consider the inconvenience caused to the customer through loss of the system or delays in repair."
"While the electrical insulation industry has been fortunate in the number and quality of new material developments over the past several decades, (epoxies, silicones and polyimides to name a few) most material and product improvements have been a series of minor changes. One of the more recent steps in this evolution has been the development and commercial adoption of “GEMAT,”* a composite of a bonded and relatively thin glass mat with reinforcement of glass yarns, cloth or organic film. The glass mat alone is of limited value, but can be readily incorporated into a wide variety of composite structures used in the electrical industry."
"The development of the dry wound-post impregnation system (VPI) represented a significant advance in insulation technology. This system matches or exceeds competitive insulation systems in all qualities considered essential for an insulation system for rotating machinery. The versatility of epoxy resins made such a development possible and gave the insulating materials supplier formulation latitude not available in other polymers. Today, however, electrical equipment manufacturers are demanding further improvements in epoxy formulations and the search continues for the “ideal” insulation system."
"While it must be well recognized that the use of film faced flexible resin tapes can not compete with: 1. The long term voltage life under very high voltage stress offered by Resin Rich Tapes when press cured. 2. The physical strength required in very large high speed machines such as steam turbine generators and offered by Resin Rich Tapes when press cured."
"(i) The use of B stage resin rich materials based on synthetic resins, mica paper and glass are in wide use as the insulation for Class F high voltage stator coils up to and including 23kV."
"1. The breakdown voltage obtained of a new system with SiC double layers is 40% higher than that for single layer of commonly used system."
"It has been shown experimentally that the combined effects of electrical and thermal aging can be evaluated properly only with simultaneous application of both kinds of stresses. A logical simultaneous aging test can be based on the conventional voltage and thermal endurance curves. This method can be expanded to other pairs of aging factors."
"During the past 20 years, there has been a great change in the designs of electrical rotating equipment. The trend has been to get more power out of a given frame size. This has been accomplished by using the active steel more efficiently and because of the temperature improvements of insulating materials, the equipment operates at higher temperatures. The end result is more power for a given frame size."
"Why impregnate? What are the primary functions of an impregnant for random wound motors? From an insulation or dielectric viewpoint the turn to turn and ground insulation is provided by the enamel on the magnet wire and the cell liner."
"Trial production of a submersible motor for use in a deep sea research vessel with a submersible depth of 6,000 m has been completed and functionally satisfactory data have been obtained by experiments. Severe characteristics are required for the insulation to be used in this motor. The main difficulty for the insulation is resistance to the high pressures of sea water."
"By incorporating esterimide groupings in a reaction component of polyurethane wire, we have succeeded in producing a wire with temperature index ISS, which is produced at the same speeds as conventional PUR wires but exhibits a higher thermoplasticity limit and overload capability while retaining the same soldering properties. Thus it is possible to use the wire for traditional applications for PUR wires, but with high loadings, as well as for windings exposed to more severe mechanical stressing, such as contactor coils and rotors."
"For many years the wire industry has worked to upgrade the high temperature performance of low-cost insulating materials. One technique that has been developed is cross-linking by irradiation. Introduced 21 years ago, the irradiation process is a simple one. After the thermoplastic compound is extruded onto wire, it is exposed to high energy electrons from an electron accelerator. The energy from the fast moving electrons is intense enough to change the chemical structure of many materials. In a properly formulated polymer system this change can cause extensive cross-linking and even change a thermoplastic to an insoluble, infusible thermosetting plastic."
"1. The stress generated by the cure shrinkage of resin was measured by strain gauges attached on the inner surface of steel or glass cylinder coaxially casted with epoxy resin, and found to start at the glass transition temperature of the resin and to increase linearly by cooling."
"Various commercial epoxy resin powders were investigated and the most desirable coating materials were specified. The coated bars with epoxy coating materials B provided the desirable dielectric strength, flame retardance, and resistance to tracking."
"This paper reports on the semi-automated epoxy casting facility located at the Power Circuit Breaker Division of Westinghouse Electric Corporation in Trafford, Pennsylvania. At the present time the facility is being used to cast both large and small insulators for SF 6 gas and oil type power circuit breakers. The paper discusses the overall facility and the specifications of the various pieces of equipment in the facility. To facilitate the discussion, photographs (slides) of the equipment are included. Also reported are the different epoxy formulations that can be processed with the equipment."
"A 150 kV BIL bushing construction combining reflux cooling and epoxy insulation provides 6 kA continuous-current capability and mechanical durability within the confines of dimensions common to lower ratings."
"The operation of electrical insulation at cryogenic temperatures is becoming increasingly frequent. It is important, to design a reliable insulation system, to know the behaviour of dielectrics under voltage stress at low temperatures."
"Transformer insulation systems can generally be categorized as liquid-solid, solid-gas or solid-solid. Dependent on the type of insulation, amount and how it is used in conjunction with the other parts of the transformer, are transformer voltage insulation classes, basic impulse insulation levels, average winding temperature rise at rated KVA, and operating environment. A number of characteristics and performance requirements necessary for proper electrical, mechanical and thermal performance are reviewed. Insulation materials are identified and described briefly relating to use in transformer application. This paper also includes recent improvements in the liquid-solid insulation system by using additives to improve mineral oil life and insulation thermal performance. A transformer having the proper insulation system will generally dictate its selection and application for indoor and outdoor service, voltage, fire or explosion hazard elimination, and environmental conditions such as clean and dry or highly corrosive or wet and dusty locations."
"By application of the physical laws of dielectrics we have shown that critical voltage stress areas of a transformer coil can be treated in such a manner as to minimize these stresses without the necessity of special winding configurations or overdesigning which result in more costly coils. They do however, require a thorough engineering analysis of the stresses and the dielectric constants of the insulating materials. It should be noted that both stress reduction techniques have been successfully applied to transformer designs for more than two years and are covered by the following United States Patents-3713061 and 3748616."
"The test results show that silicone resin impregnated glass-cloth and Aramid tapes have a higher Oxygen Index rating, less tendency to spread fire and develop less smoke than polyester or epoxy resins with silicone resin impregnants, the full fire resistant characteristics of the glass-cloth and Aramid paper can be utilized."
"Developments in the Electrical Insulating Varnish field are being made for a variety of reasons. Upgrading the quality of the electrical unit is, of course, the paramount reason. Producing materials that will process more rapidly and consume less energy or that will conform to EPA and OSHA requirements with a minimum of addition costs are important secondary objectives."
"A new semiconductive glaze insulator with superior glaze and greatly improved contamination performance has been developed for use in vertical and V-string positions. This insulator makes it possible to convert many existing lines to operation at higher voltages and to design new lines with greatly reduced tower head dimensions."
"It has been shown that there is a very pronounced correlation between shed design and resin formulation for epoxy cast bushings. Consistent with the standard NEMA requirements for a given voltage class, the following should be observed: 1. Design of an epoxy cast bushing should be considered on its own merit and not unduly prejudiced by standard porcelain design practices. 2. Shed designs such as those shown in Figures 3 and 4 with uniform taper and without deep undercuts have given good performance in long time dust and fog tests. Such sheds exhibited surface arcing and had the least deleterious effect on the resin substrate. 3. Assuming (1) and (2) above, alumina trihydrate filled mixtures even with benzene rings in the chemical structures can perform satisfactorily."
"1. Casting compositions of new cycloaliphatic epoxy resins derived from butadiene oligomer have very good processability, electrical, and mechanical properties in electrical applications."
"Since very early times, man has tried to find ways of simply bonding readily available materials (e.g., straw, pebbles, etc.) together to attain some structural integrity. The bond obtainable through the process of hydration was certainly one of the earliest solutions. Today, with our modern technologies, we have boron fibers in a metal matrix, glass fibers or glass-bonded crystallites in epoxy, or even sand bonded with an epoxy. This paper concerns the application of modern technology to the ancient air of utilizing the hydraulic bond for making composites. Specifically we shall discuss some of our developments pertaining to the potential utilization of a specially processed concrete for outdoor insulation."
"Information has been presented which demonstrates the predominant physical and electrical properties of a new three mil thick crepe. Comparison is made with a flat sheet of the same thickness and the results are listed as follows."
"Creped kraft paper covered magnet wire, when used in oil-filled transformers should give high impulse ratio, high impulse breakdown stress, and excellent AC breakdown stress."
"The first large transformer using silicone oil has been completed. Due to the excellent characteristics of silicone oil, the transformer will be designed with considerable reduction in size and weight."
"As shown in Figure 3, the 60 Hz permittivity of the blend of naphthenic base oils used in this investigation decreased almost linearly with increasing temperature. Using available density /temperature data for a comparable oil as the basis for analysis, good correlation is obtained in relating the change in permittivity to change in density of the oil."
"(1) We have developed some excellent insulating oils made from highly refined paraffinic crudes. We confirmed our experimental results above by processing at our commercial plant. The refining method consisted of solvent extraction, hydrogenation, solvent dewaxing, and clay treatment."
"SP 309 is a new cycloaliphatic epoxy resin system reinforced with continuous non-woven glass fibers, with the following product advantages: • Very high strength • Good dimensional stability • Superior arc-track resistance and other electrical properties • Good high temperature performance up to 300°F. (150°C.), giving G-11 grade properties • Excellent shelf life in prepreg form • High fatigue strength."
"1. Glass fiber reinforced epoxy resins are suitable for the construction of insulating, anti-magnetic, load-bearing parts, not only for higher temperatures in class F, but also for immersion in cryogenic liquids."
"Most of the modern insulating materials are based on polymers and the greater percentage lies in the thermoplastic group. The greatest volume is PVC in the cable industry followed by film materials for such applications as capacitors. In general, the thermoplastic polymers are used where the application is almost entirely one of electrical insulation and the mechanical requirements are a secondary consideration."
"We have developed high performance composite insulations for e1ectrodeposition magnet wire by introducing a dual coating technique."
"The substitution of water for the conventional cresylic/hydrocarbon system into polyester type enamels has presented no problems in its use. Tower profiles, speeds and application equipment have remained unchanged, thus providing for a smooth transition to water based systems."
"A comparison of the thermal ratings, chemical resistance, physical characteristics, wire enamel compatibility and application techniques between water soluble and organic solvent type insulating varnishes and coatings is presented. The benefits to be realized from the use of these non-dispersion or non-emulsion type varnishes and coatings in the areas of reduced air pollution and fire hazard are also discussed."
"1. Out of various bondable resins tested, only a new developed thermosetting resin has almost the same properties as conventionally used epoxy varnish for hermetic motor use."
"This new dimensional proposal for magnet wire is intended for use at the time conversion to the SI (metric) system will, by industry consent, take place. It contains elements of present NEMA and IEC standards and makes extensive use of the simplifying features of the preferred number series and power law relationships between the conductor diameter and derived dimensions (builds) and properties (dielectric breakdown strength)."
"Although there have been no major changes or innovations in production methods for enameling magnet wire in recent years, many organic solvents change almost with the cycle of the moon, and has generated many difficulties not only in deliveries but also budget forecasts. Solvent removal from conventional wire enamel solutions along with incineration are important factors in manufacturing and pollution control costs."
"During the last five years possible methods of application of insulation coating on winding wire without organic solvents were widely discussed. A few of the different methods are compared. The problems involved are related to two different groups of procedures, one of which is characterized by using no solvents at all and the other by using mainly water as the transport system."
"Liquid epoxy resins, cured with acid anhydrides, comprise, in terms of total usage volumes, the most important class of castable insulation compounds. They are used for encapsulation and impregnation of transformers, lifting magnets, motor stators, solenoids and other coils, for casting stand off bushings and for potting multipliers and other electrical components."
"1. A new family of the cycloaliphatic epoxy resins were derived and developed from derivatives of butadiene. These resins offer lower toxicity due to lower vapor pressures of the liquid resin components."
"1. S494 is a silicone based mica product capable of hot pressing on conventional equipment."
"1. By modifying the resin (or varnish) a class of BS2Rs can be made to fit specific needs."
"Today, safety is an extremely important factor in the selection of materials. For this reason alone, it appears that silicone rubber will often be the material of choice because it generates very little smoke or toxic vapor during exposure to flame. Furthermore, because it maintains electrical integrity even after being exposed to flame, and because of its excellent thermal and aging characteristics, improved mechanical properties, and absence to cold flow it appears that silicone rubber has the well balanced profile of properties needed in today's applications."
"Product Safety is obtained by addressing our talents to two areas, one where product design and reliability can provide safety, and the other where the controlling of hazards can be obtained by supplying proper information to avoid misuse."
"The early failure of a pair of contacts in a small number of multiple switches operating an inductive load was experienced. Upon opening the switch bodies it was found that these contacts were physically closed, but yet they would not carry enough current to perform the intended function."
"Injection molding of thermosets has been widely publicized. Recently much of this publicity has been aimed at injection molding of glass reinforced thermoset polyester, primarily in the area of equipment developments which have made this process practical. However, the process itself is still new and mysterious enough that it is not being fully utilized. The objective here is to acquaint potential users of this process with the present “state of the art” of this relatively new technology, and its capabilities in terms of product properties and economics. Injection molding of thermoset glass polyester is no longer just a dream, but is very much a practical and proven method of manufacture today with materials and equipment that are commercia1ly available."
"1. The melting point of a plastic is a variable quantity. It is determined primarily by the conditions under which it crystallises or is annealed."
"Presents the title page of the proceedings record."
"Presents the copyright information for the conference. May include reprint permission information."
"Conference proceedings front matter may contain various advertisements, welcome messages, committee or program information, and other miscellaneous conference information. This may in some cases also include the cover art, table of contents, copyright statements, title-page or half title-pages, blank pages, venue maps or other general information relating to the conference that was part of the original conference proceedings."
"The following topics are dealt with: electronic warfare; EMC; electromagnetic pulse; antennas; and data acquisition systems."
"TFA sprang from the strongly felt need to plan, within the framework of the IEEE, something constructive about the disturbing instability of the EE job market with which we all are now quite familiar. The IEEE, TAB, hired Dr. William Morsch on a full-time basis and provides a modest budget for TFA. Groups and Societies assigned TFA representatives, many of them putting in quite some work. The economic downturn slowed the TFA project somehow. But by concentrating on five main thrust areas (power, communications, instrumentation, computers, components), excellent progress was made as evidenced by the recent Spectrum articles. To start the project in sufficient scope, all G/S's were asked to submit a \"tree\" delineating their specific activities, products and services, preferably commensurably organized such that a later syndication of all G/S activities is facilitated. A tree for TFA, then, is not necessarily the same tree which a G/S would design, if it were designing the tree for internal use. The TFA - EMC tree is still in the formative stage and looks at present like this (see Fig. 1, pg 12). We still have some time to finalize our tree (and suggestions to a forum member will be welcome). The reason is that EMC, like reliability, is essentially an interdisciplinary services affair, meaning that the forecasting and assessment of its growing impact is much dependent on the product development in the main thrust areas."
"The stated objective of TFA is threefold: * \"It will provide IEEE members with information for career planning, opportunities for using their skills which they should anticipate, and the training needs which are implied. * It will develop a conceptual framework for reviewing activities of IEEE entities and for indicating appropriate areas for new IEEE programs. * It will establish for the IEEE a role in the development and evaluation of public policies which may affect, or be affected by, trends in electrotechnology.\""
 "It can be stated in the article that the pulse-to-pulse amplitude variations of the chaff cloud depends upon the turbulence in and around the cloud. For self-protection chaff dispensed from jet aircraft, these amplitude variations generate changes in RCS of 30 dB Qr more that are common with 20 d$ or more occurring approximately 8% of the time, and 10 dB or more occurring about 30% of the time. These variations in RCS generates a spectrum that is very, wide compared to that conventionally reported in the literat're. Further work is required tQ clearly define the limits of the RCS. variations an to define the phase variations that occur on a pulse-to-pulse basis."
 "A tactical environment data simulator has been developed which provides realistic tactical simulated electronic data derived from multiple airborne collectors. Large volumes of pulse measurement data (millions of pulses per collector) as seen by an intelligence processing system, or simulated system intercept data (estimated radar location and signal parameter observations derived from processing of pulse measurement data) can be generated. The simulated pulse measurement data and/or the system intercepts can be utilized to test and evaluate a variety of tactical intelligence processing systems. These include automatic systems which perform the following functions: 1) Order of battle determination 2) Threat assessment and evaluation 3) Detection of new or improved weapons systems 4) Mobile radar system tracking 5) Detection of imminence ,of hostilities The data simulator provides a coordinated multiflight data generation capability. All physical processes modeled are continuous over the interval of time between flights over the area of interest. This includes collector dynamics, target dynamics, radar emissions, and antenna dynamics."
"Computer based systems should ease the action-reaction burden on electronic warfare (EW) R&D and allow a more orderly approach to EW development. Radar threat frequency proliferation coupled with maximum use of ECCM circuits and aided by electro-optical devices will complicate the EW response making better utilization of available resources (power management) mandatory. Independent electro-optical weapons (laser, optical, infrared) will become increasingly more sophisticated and demand a commensurate share of available resources."
"This panel session brings together a select group of professionals who have basic knowledge in electrooptics; to promote discussions between them such as to bring out technical aspects of electrooptics development, areas of agreement and disagreement on concepts, approaches, etc.; and to integrate the technical discussion with members of the audience such that they may gain knowledge for their pursuits. In meeting this objective the following areas are treated: spectrum management and allocation; electrooptical technology; systems, components, trends and awareness to compatibility and safety; EMC of electrooptic systems- optical-to-optical interference, RF-to-optical interference, optical-to-RF interference- need for new concepts of analysis and measurements; hazards-the effects of optical radiation on biological environments and materials; and standards- systems, components, safety, etc."
"MIL-STD-1541 is a composite system specification for space systems. As a composite specification it includes the requirements for equipment level EMI tests and overall system EMC tests. It also includes design requirements tailored to the space environment, as well as stringent management controls for an effective EMC program. While the standard incorporates the existing military standards and specifications on interference control, such as MIL-E-6051, MIL-STD-461 and MIL-STD-462, it contains sufficient additions and modifications to warrant its issuance as a separate standard. The standard is expected to be selectively imposed on a total space system, with heavy emphasis on the design analysis phase, with its concommitent stress on the responsibility of the integration contractor to conduct a comprehensive system EMC program."
"Satellites at synchronous altitude exhibit unexplained behavior in the operation of electronic circuits and in the performance of thermal controls. A possible explanation for this behavior is the fact that satellites can be charged to large negative voltages by energetic electrons in the space environment. A space measurements program entitled SCATHA has been formulated to determine the characteristics of the charging process, to measure the response of the satellite when charging occurs and to evaluate the utility of various corrective techniques which can minimize differential charging on the satellite. The instrumentation will measure charging levels and rates of twenty samples of satellite materials, some of which will be modified to prevent buildup of electrostatic charge. The electromagnetic interference background on the satellite will be measured for comparison with MIL STD 461, Electromagnetic Interference Characteristics Requirements for Equipment. Simultaneous measurements of electron and ion properties will be performed over an energy range of 1 to 107 electron volts to correlate with the electrical charging data. The purpose for these measurements is to specify design criteria and test procedures which can be used to assure that satellites will not be adversely affected when exposed to electrical charging by the space environment. The model by which satellites can be electrically charged will be described and the SCATHA instrumentation, which has been formulated on the basis of the charging model, will be discussed."
"The U.S. Department of Defense Electromagnetic Compatibility Analysis Center (ECAC) has developed numerous mathematical models during the past decade for performing electromagnetic compatibility analyses. Two sets of models selected from ECAC's computer program library have been adapted for use with programmable desk-top calculators. The programs are available in several different versions, each designed to be used with one of the popular makes of programmable calculators. Also, ECAC has developed a frequency management system for programmable calculators to assist frequency managers in their daily record keeping activities and for applying the above analytical models in making frequency assignments. This capability allows the frequency manager to directly update records using a relatively inexpensive automated system. This workshop session will include a description of all the capabilities, a discussion of the applications of these capabilities, and the procedures for obtaining the programs. A demonstration of the capabilities using the calculators will also be given."
"Many EMI programs have been written and are currently available. Some of these are: cable coupling, magnetic field shielding, waveform analysis for 11 wave shapes, mismatched capacitor, and pi and tee filter design. This paper will consider cable coupling problems. All of the following work on cable coupling is taken directly from R. J. Mohr's earlier work."
 "The lightning protection requirements for solid state circuits of the Mark III ILS which are connected to buried control cables are presented. Susceptible circuits consist of transistor switches, relays, and dc power supplies. Avalanche diode surge protectors with associated resistance are used to protect the circuits from the worst-case 1000-volt, 10 × 1000 μsec surge waveform expected."
       "There are many alternative ways to harden aircraft to nuclear electromagnetic pulse (EMP) effects, but conceptually these can be reduced to three basic approaches: (1) try to keep the radio-frequency energy out of the aircraft (2) harden the electronics to withstand the signals that do penetrate (3) combinations of (1) and (2) above. In a series of trade studies performed for the government, it was concluded that to harden the C-130 aircraft it would be most cost-effective to begin by closing the points-of-entry (POEs)2 into the fuselage. The trade studies indicated that this would provide the greatest benefit in improving hardness with the least impact on cost, weight, reliability, and maintainability. Based on this background, a detailed investigation was started to identify all the points-of-entry on the C-130, and to devise ways to close them. Hardware kits were subsequently designed and fabricated to support aircraft modification. Preliminary tests were performed to assess the probable benefit of closing the POEs. Results to date have been very encouraging, indicating a major improvement at very low cost. This paper presents the preliminary results of this on-going activity."
                     "EMI filtering and shielding design methods and procedures are explained as they should be applied to commercial Data Processing Equipment. Since cost is one of the prime considerations for commercial computers, the P. C. boards, backpanels, data cables, power supplies, etc. must be designed and laid-out using good EMC guidelines to avoid excessive EMI filtering and shielding. The cabinet should be designed right from the drawing board with good EMI concepts which would include: allocating space for EMI filters in a shielded AC entry junction box, providing for EMI gaskets around the periphery of doors and panels (to form a shielded cabinet) separating wires and cables for proper spacing, providing for shielding all I/O data cables, filtering all AC and DC lines which pass through the cabinet, designing the proper grounding concept, etc."
                 "Considerable research has been conducted to investigate near-field coupling between antennas, both with and without obstacles located in the near-field of the antennas, but until now, very little research has been conducted to provide information for predicting the effects of various near-field obstacle blockages on far-field antenna performance characteristics. Recently completed research investigations at Georgia Tech for the U. S. Naval Ship Engineering Center have yielded considerable design information and have provided much insight into potential problem areas such as those dealing with nearfield obstacles and their effects on far-field gain loss, beamwidths, beamshifts, and maximum sidelobe levels. The effects of several variables on these far-field antenna performance characteristics were investigated, and various trends as well as typical design curves will be discussed. The usefulness of the information is illustrated by insertion of the far-field gain-loss data into a computer program for shipboard siting of antennas. Moreover, based on theoretical and experimental investigations with a dielectric-coated solid metal circular mast, applications of dielectric coatings to portions of ship superstructures to improve the far-field antenna performance is possible. A correlation of the effects of near-field obstacles on far-field antenna characteristics and on near-field antenna-to-antenna coupling is also possible."

      "This paper addresses the use of an LSI microprocessor as the key element of a controller for an electromagnetic data acquisition system. The particular aspect of the acquisition problem discussed here is related to tuning the receiver and sampling a detected video signal. The example used demonstrates the capability of the microprocessor to adequately perform the receiver control function. An Intel 8080 microprocessor was chosen to demonstrate the concept; however, the approach can be adapted to a wide range of microprocessors."
"The low cost and flexibility of microcomputers have created .a burst of activity in intelligent data acquisition systems. Radio frequency surveillance, electronic warfare systems, and navigational control are a few of the more visible applications. The power of well-designed microcomputers, when coupled with present day electronic detection and control equipment, is creating a state-of-the-art technological breakthrough in system designs. Noise control, pollution analysis, environmental quality in general, radar tracking and control, radio frequency analysis and interference detection are all candidates for distributed data acquisitions systems. This paper describes the use of microprocessors to control a radio frequency detection system."
"In dedicated systems, the required computational tasks can often dictate the system architecture. Multiple processors can be configured such that each processor shares the computing load. Parallel, series and series-parallel configurations can be effectively used depending upon the problem structure. A signal recognition system shows how shared memory processing modules can be configured to increase processing speed."
           "A baseband impulse generator recently developed at NBS is described. It is completely solid state and features a 100 kHz maximum repetition rate, 50 ohm source impedance, an extremely narrow 100 ps duration impulse of 8 volts amplitude, and a flat spectrum greater than 60 dBμV/MHz up to 5 GHz. The generator was evaluated on the NBS Automatic Pulse Measurement System which measured the time domain waveform with a sampling oscilloscope and computed the spectrum on a minicomputer."
  "A new design technique is proposed for reducing undesirable nonlinear effects. The method utilizes the fact that certain in-band nonlinear responses, such as intermodulation, desensitization, and cross-modulation, depend upon the out-of-band linear behavior of the network. This concept is illustrated by means of a simple example."

"It is well-known that fluorocarbon polymers can be formed into very stable electrets, but admittedly all dielectrics are able to store charges. This study is aimed at evaluating the electret properties of SiO2. One advantage of this material is that its good mechanical properties would improve the dimensional stability of electret transducers."
"Static charge on insulators is easily detectable but a precise measurement of the magnitude of the charge often presents a much greater problem. The usual method is to enclose the charged insulator in a Faraday cage connected to an electrometer. However in many cases, as with moving film webs, this is impractical. Thus we resort to measuring the electric field near the charged web with a fieldmeter. Because the field varies with distance from the web and with the relation between the charged web and nearby grounded objects (the geometry), this measurement is practically never used to determine charge density. However, in certain cases, such as uniformly charged webs, the charge density can be reasonably accurately determined from fieldmeter measurements. This paper describes several cases and presents curves for converting the fieldmeter measurements to charge density."
"In the search for new materials useful in electrophotography, it has been recognized that there are photoconducting insulators whose charge transport properties are governed by a drift mobility that is not constant, but varies with electric field. The most prominent of these materials is the organic polymer poly-N-vinyl-carbazole (PVK)1 and its complexes with organic electron acceptors such as 2, 4, 7-trinitro-9-fluorenone (TNF).2 Further, there is increasing evidence that the drift mobility in materials as varied as polyethylene3 and Ge(Li)4 depends on electric field."
"The widespread application of electrets in practical devices1 has resulted in intensified interest in the charge storage processes in these materials. Significant progress has been made in the study of charge tapping levels by thermally stimulated current measurements, and the like.2 Much less is known, however, about the spatial distribution of charge within electrets."
"Since the report by Kawai1 that polyvinylidenefluoride could be made piezoelectric by the temporary application of a high electric field, there has been renewed interest in producing a piezoelectric polymer with a large piezoelectric coefficient and long lifetime. The search for the optimum chemical and physical properties and the optimum poling conditions would be greatly enhanced by a knowledge of the mechanism responsible for piezoelectric and pyroelectric response in polymer films. This paper will briefly review a theory developed for amorphous polymers which attributes piezoelectric and pyroelectric response to the effect of a volume change in the polarization resulting from frozen-in dipole alignment achieved during the poling process. In addition, the pyroelectric coefficient includes a contribution from a change in the amplitude of oscillation of dipoles about a fixed mean position. Experimental results for a semicrystalline copolymer of vinylidenefluoride and tetrafluoroethylene will then be compared with values expected from the model. Mopsik and Broadhurst2 applied an Onsager cavity approach to calculate the polarization in a system in which a polarizable dipole interacts with aligned dipoles in the surrounding dielectric. In such a case, they find the polarization P given by: P = (ε∞ + 2 / 3) Nμ0/V <cos θ> (1) in which ε∞ is the relative permittivity for immobilized dipoles, μo is the vacuum dipole moment, N is the number of dipoles in the volume V, and <cos θ> is the averaged cosine of the angle between the individual dipole moments and the total sample moment."
"Persistent electrical polarizations can be established in most polymer films by poling at elevated temperatures. A variety of contributions are now known to make major contributions to this polarization; these include preferred orientation of dipolar groups, asymmetrically displaced ionized species, asymmetrically distributed charged groups created in the polymer molecules themselves, and ions injected from external sources into the polymer solid. As long as characteristic times associated with relaxation of these electrical anisotropies are long compared with the observation period, then the material will effectively retain whatever is the net polarization. It follows, then, that heating these materials will quicken these relaxation processes, and one can stimulate the discharge of these polarizations thermally. Analysis of the temperature-dependence of the overall depolarization of such a polymer specimen will usually reveal that the various contributions to total polarization discharge more or less individually. Some discharge steps will display Arrhenius-type kinetics, corresponding to simple solid state diffusional transport or to the onset of mobility of small groups of atoms in polymer chains; other discharge steps may display WLF-type kinetics, implying that the depolarization event requires mobility of whole segments of polymer backbones."
"The study of charge storage by thermally stimulated depolarization (TSD) measurements has recently been of considerable interest.1 These studies have shown that the heterocharge arising from a uniform volume polarization is due to either the dipolar reorientation, or diffusion of charge upon their release from traps. The majority of materials studied as electrets are either polymeric, or long-chained compounds and they show, in addition to a heterocharge, a number of charge separation processes grouped under the space charge or Maxwell-Wagner effect. In many cases it is difficult to separate the dipolar orientation processes from other effects."
"Measurements of thermal stimulated current (TSC) in Teflon, and the dependence of the temperature of the maximum of the current on crystalline transition temperature were made by various authors.1,2 Studies were also made on electron-irradiated3 and corona treated4 Teflon; the temperatures of the current maxima were related with the transition temperature. In the present work on Teflon, measurements of electrical current, in the presence of a thermal gradient, are investigated and related to the transition temperature. Some of the current peaks reported in the literature, observed in measurements2 of TSC (i.e., with the application of an external electrical field), were observed in this work, without any external electrical field, but with a temperature gradient."
"Previous studies on magnetoelectrets (ME) of Perspex (polymethylmethacrylate) by Qureshi and Bhatnagar1–2 have shown that ME samples prepared below the softening temperature (120°C) of the polymer have a positive isocharge accompanied by a slight increase in dielectric constant. At forming temperatures above the softening temperature, contribution of positive idio-charge (positive charge on N-pole facing surface and negative on S-pole facing surface) increases, accompanied by a decrease in dielectric constant. As surface charge decays with time, there is a change in the dielectric constant; a decrease in dielectric constant in the former case and an increase in the later case. The increase in dielectric constant was attributed to the orientation of side chains of the polymer along the field direction. At higher temperatures, these side chains are thought to orient the main chain segments in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the field, thereby causing a decrease in dielectric constant of the ME samples. As the surface charge decays, there is a recovery in the dielectric constant due to the reorientation of the polymer chains."
"Poly (N-vinylcarbazole), PVK, is a condensed ring heteroaromatic polymeric photoconductor. It has been the subject of many recent investigations, particularly in relation to usage in electrophotography. Its photoconductive properties are fairly well known. However, only a minimum effort has been made to determine its trap structure.1"
"The purpose of this paper is to describe a technique for characterizing near steady state charge transport in thin film dielectric materials under various well controlled ambient conditions. This is important because failure to achieve perfect insulation limits the performance of several sorts of devices. For example, materials used to separate layers of hybrid circuits become lossy at high ambient humidity. The spreading of charge across a surface of thermoplastic used in holography or across paper used for electrographic reproduction adds a limitation to the achievable resolution. The breakdown of high voltage insultators is also influenced by the migration of surface charges. From a direct application point of view the variation of semiconducting properties in a dielectric film can be used to sense the presence of various substances in the environment."
"Although various types of classifications are used to describe electrets, often taking into account the way they have been prepared (thermoelectrets, radioelectrets, etc.) two classifications are particularly meaningful: a structural one and a functional one. The first takes into account the nature of the charges producing the electret while the second is related to the fact that the electret may or may not create an external field."
"All of the cured (cross-linked) polymers we studied have a pair of electret transition peaks separated by 20 to 60° C. The lower temperature current peak is clearly due to the glass-rubber transition in each case and the upper peak has always behaved as a so called “ρ-transition.” The latter is said to be associated with charge drift that is limited by space charge, diffusion of excess charges, ohmic conduction, and/or Maxwell-Wagner polarization. This paper will present and discuss data illustrating the use of electrode materials and swelling in the study of these “ρ-transitions.”."

"The formation or presence of small bubbles from various sources plays an important role in the high field conduction and breakdown phenomena in hydrocarbon insulating liquids.1,2,3 The possibility of observing electron multiplication or Townsend α-processes is diminished by the presence of such bubbles which provide a competing gas phase in which electron avalanches develop relatively easily. Energetic electron processes may also be impeded by the presence of C-H bonds whose vibrational excitations provide a favorable energy loss mechanism for electrons.4 The eventual breaking of these bonds can also result in the evolution of hydrogen5 which can serve as one of the sources of gas bubbles."
"Because of the changing supply situation for “transformer oils,” it is particularly important to understand the mechanisms by which these oils react. In particular, if the compositional dependences of these reactions can be established, oils from different crude oil sources or refining processes can be more readily assessed and used with confidence. Optimum compositions can be established, processing techniques leading to the optimum can be considered and improved techniques to continually assess the quality of the resulting oils can be developed."
"For some time a needle-to-sphere impulse breakdown test (ASTM D-3300) has been used for characterization of insulating oils used in high voltage equipment. Several observations can be made based upon a long background of use with this test."

"In this paper we shall survey measurements of dielectric properties of materials with respect to precision. We shall consider both optimum and extreme conditions, and try to indicate the source and magnitude of errors. To better acquaint conferees (and readers) with the National Bureau of Standards, we shall choose a disproportionate share of the examples from work done or in progress at NBS."
"In any cryogenic, high-voltage cable design, it is crucial that the advantage in conductor efficiency won by cooling is not offset by an intolerable refrigeration load due to dielectric and other losses. This constraint is especially felt by designers of tape-insulated, ac superconducting cables.1 In this case, the steady-state power loss from the dielectric alone is P ∝ V2 ω ε' tan δ. For a cable designed to operate at voltage V and frequency ω/2π, the only way to reduce P for a given cable geometry is by minimizing the product ε' tan δ. Here ε' is the real part of the dielectric constant ε = ε' + jε”, and tan δ = ε″/ε'."
"With the current interest in cryogenic superconducting cables, there has been a demand for low loss dielectrics so that insulator losses do not become greater than the conductor losses.1 Since not much is known about the losses of polymer films at cryogenic temperatures, selection of a suitable insulation system for a superconducting power cable being designed by Brookhaven National Laboratory has been a major problem. We are working cooperatively with Brookhaven to evaluate polymer films for dielectric loss at cryogenic temperatures to aid in the selection process. Together, we have designed and built a dielectric cell suitable for use at cryogenic temperatures. The cell is designed to be used over the entire audio frequency region and at any temperature from liquid helium temperature to room temperature so that any losses can be studied as to their origin."
"Most dielectric loss measurements are made by using a capacitance bridge. Bridge methods however require standard capacitors. These capacitors have dielectric loss tangents of about 10−5 and loss tangents smaller than this cannot easily be measured with bridge techniques. Furthermore, the measurement is a relative rather than an absolute one, and thus its precision is dependent on how precisely the loss of the standard capacitor is known.1"
"The determination of the density of cryogenic liquids, particularly those that represent mixtures of two or more components, is difficult and yet of considerable practical importance. The difficulties arising from carrying out high precision measurements at cryogenic temperatures are well known and need not be reviewed here. The practical importance of the results obtained with these measurements are perhaps less known since they are designed to meet the need of close inventory control, and equitable custody transfer. For these purposes it is necessary to know the density to at least ±0.1% at the prevailing temperature. While it is relatively easy to measure capacitances and hence dielectric constants to within this accuracy or better, the translation of these data into density with the help of the Clausius Mossotti equation (CME) is not as facile. This paper presents the results of dielectric measurements carried out in a large storage tank filled with liquid mixtures of ethane, propane, n-butane, and isobutane. It also examines the validity of linear mixing laws for these liquids and the use of the CME. Finally it interprets the observed changes in density in terms of the liquids compressibility."
"Transient or “time domain” methods have become of considerable interest in the last few years because of the availability of fast pulse generators and sampling oscilloscopes permitting measurements in the range 10−11 to 10−7 seconds, corresponding to frequencies from a few megahertz to a few gigahertz. The voltage pulse reflected from a dielectric sample in a coaxial line after arrival of an incident pulse with short rise time (ca. 40 psec) resembles the dielectric current response to a step voltage, but is distorted by effects of finite amplitude of the reflected pulse, propagation in the sample, and the sample termination, all of which must be taken into account in a proper analysis."
"Dielectric relaxation has proved itself a useful tool for studying molecular motions or very fast chemical kinetics in the liquid phase.1 For a large number of experiments it is essential to carefully investigate the frequency region 3–300 GHz where radio techniques merge with optical techniques. The aim of our paper is to show that a broad band Michelson interferometer, featuring oversized rectangular waveguide (RG49/U) is suitable for rapid but accurate complex permittivity measurements over the whole 15–300 GHz frequency range. Some complementary data can be obtained in the X-band (7–12 GHz) from a similar but standard waveguide (RG52/U) arrangement using a magic tee as beam divider. Typical interferograms as well as Cole-Cole plots of some liquids will be reproduced. Also encouraging is the coherence of our results with far ir data."
"Traditional methods of rock electrometry and dielectrometry have been summarized by Keller1 and Parkhomenko.2 Bridge, resonance (coaxial and slotted line), and heterodyne methods have been applied from the kilo-to the giga-hertz range of frequency. Each method has its maximum validity in a given frequency range, and sometimes for certain ranges of the resistive and reactive components to be measured. Conventional bridge instrumentation is usually unstable and noisy below audio frequencies."
"The dielectric loss of polyethylene (PE) at radio frequencies is of crucial interest to the designer and user of submarine telecommunication cables. In simplified form the attenuation/meter of a co-axial cable is given by: A√f·T + B·f·tan δ · √ε (1) where f is the frequency, ε the permittivity and tan δ the loss of the dielectric. A and Β are constants which depend on the cable dimensions and conductors. The resistive losses in the conductors, governed by the first term in Equation (1), far exceed the losses in the dielectric given by the second term, although the relative importance of the dielectric loss increases as the frequency rises. An impression of the importance of the dielectric loss in a submarine cable system may be gained from Matsuoka's1 figures for the number of repeaters required in a 3500 n.mile cable working at 30 MHz. A 10 μrad increase in dielectric loss at a nominal value of 50 μrad would require the insertion of four extra repeater amplifiers with a substantial increase in the total system cost."
"In recent papers,1,2 the authors have reported the low-frequency dielectric constants, ε', for crystalline α-quartz from two different sources and 24 kinds of commercially available vitreous silica. In the present work, 5 more kinds of vitreous silica have been studied. In addition, the temperature and pressure variation of the low-frequency dielectric constant has been measured for several samples."
"The dissipation factors of very low loss dielectrics can be measured with precision by resonant circuit methods. Link and Johnson1 and the writer2 have described apparatus and procedures, useful to above 30 MHz, based on the Hewlett-Packard 4342A Q-Meter and the General Radio Type 1690A Hartshorn and Ward type test capacitor, while the original Hartshorn and Ward apparatus3 and its modernized versions4,5 are stated to be useful to 100 MHz. From 100 MHz to 1 GHz reentrant cavity apparatus is preferred but has not been readily available. Having a need to measure dissipation factors of certain polymers above 100 MHz, we have constructed a miniature Hartshorn and Ward type apparatus adapted to the use of crystal controlled oscillators, which has been used routinely at 150 MHz and tentatively as high as 240 MHz. This apparatus is the subject of this paper."

"It is well known that thin organic films display different properties from thick layers. This remark pertains to both low molecular weight materials and polymers. For the purpose of discussion we define a thin film as one which has a uniform thickness of less than 3 μ. Such thin polymer films usually cannot be obtained easily by conventional methods, e.g. by evaporation of solvent from suitable solutions or by melt pressing; thus a considerable effort in recent years has been devoted to studying methods of their preparation."
"Terminal measurements across Al-SiO2-Si structures provide the average oxide field, Ē, the cathode field, Ec, and the anode field, Ea. Ē is obtained from the knowledge of the applied voltage and of all voltage drops other than those across the oxide. Ec is obtained from the steady-state current density, J, and the knowledge of the injection characteristics at the cathode, which is the Al electrode in this study. Ea is inferred from measurements of high-frequency C-V shifts. The differences ΔEC = Ec − Ē and ΔEa = Ē − Ea are related by Poisson's equation to the charge, Q, created in the oxide and to the centroid of this charge, x. Thus, knowledge of Ē, Ec, and Ea provides a complete description of Q and x as follows: Δ Ec = Q/ε (1−x/ L) and Δ Ea −Δ Vfb/L = Q/ε x/L, where L is the thickness of the oxide film, ε its permittivity, and ΔVfb the flat-band voltage shift. Measurements of J were performed during the application of rectangular high-voltage pulses to initially charge-free Al-(dry thermal) SiO2-(p,<100>,16 Ω-cm) Si capacitors with film thicknesses of 494 and 263 Å, with one pulse applied to a capacitor. Measurements of CV, for each capacitor, before and after the application of the high-voltage pulse provided the corresponding CV shifts. J was also measured for MOS capacitors with 142 Å oxide film, during application of successive pulses, however, with increasing magnitudes."
"Ceramic films (such as Al2O3, SiO2, and Si3N4 have various applications because of their hardness, high-temperature integrity, and chemical inertness. Some of these films have high electrical resistivity and, hence, are used extensively for insulation purposes. For the last decade, these films have been produced in thicknesses from a few angstroms to the micron range using chemical vapor-deposition, sputtering, and evaporation techniques. These methods are being further explored to determine the possibilities of producing thick films (≈100 μm) that will protect base metal/alloys against corrosion-erosion attack in energy-conversion processes. The present paper deals with evaporation, sputtering, and ion-plating methods for producing thin as well as thick ceramic (insulating) films."
"When studying thermally stimulated currents from charged polymer films (electrets), the experimental equipment and especially the interface between the polymer film and the electrodes can be arranged in different ways1,2. The contacts can be either blocking or non-blocking. For the same type of electret each system has a characteristic current spectrum of its own. In a system with blocking electrodes at least one of the electrodes usually is separated from the film surface either by an air gap or by an insulating thin film. In a non-blocking system, on the other hand, the film surfaces are often covered by a conducting paint or by a vacuum evaporated thin metal film. If the electrodes are simply short-circuited via an electrometer, the inner electric field of the electret will have a different distribution depending on the kind of contact at the surfaces. For a charge distribution near the surface, it can be shown that the more intimate the contact between the electret and the electrodes, the larger will be that part of the charge which tends to move towards the electret surface."

"The dielectric for a flexible superconducting power transmission cable will necessarily be in the form of multi-layered tapes, impregnated by supercritical helium, wound with butt gaps to provide flexibility.1 Major consideration for the choice of an appropriate dielectric are that the dielectric should posses suitable mechanical properties at low temperatures (5–10°K), the material should have very low dielectric loss (< 20 μ radian) and it should possess high enough dielectric strength. Economic considerations dictate that the cable should operate at very high electric stress levels. For example, the Brookhaven National Laboratory superconducting cable design2 specifies an operating stress 10 MV/m, free of any significant partial discharge up to a stress of 20 MV/m. So far no dielectric material simultaneously satisfying all the mechanical and electrical requirements cited above has been found and the search for a suitable dielectric tape is still in progress. In order to arrive at an appropriate material it is necessary to evaluate various materials in terms of their mechanical and electrical characteristics. It is in this connection that we undertook a program of measurement of dielectric strength and partial discharge inception levels of polymeric insulating tapes at cryogenic temperatures."
"High voltage dc is applied to the center conductor of submarine telecommunication coaxial cables to power evenly spaced amplifiers.1 Typical systems installed thus far have powering voltages between 3 and 6 kV, with the outer conductor in contact with sea water. Although no problems with tree growth in the polyethylene insulation have been encountered, new systems presently planned will require higher terminal voltages. In order to ensure the continued high reliability of submarine cable systems, an investigation of possible water tree growth in the polyethylene cabe core was initiated. It had been assumed that water trees do not grow with direct current.2,3 Based on our initial experiments, it appears that water trees do indeed initiate and grow with dc electrical stress, but at a much slower rate than with ac."
"This paper reviews progress in studies sponsored by the Electric Power Research Institute on the subject of electro-chemical treeing in extruded miniature cable insulations. Effects of applied voltage stress and controlled temperature on tree growth in polyethylene (PE) and cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) are discussed. In addition, the relationships between tree growth and cable dielectric strength for PE, XLPE, and mineral-free Ethylene-Propylene Rubber (EPR) are presented. Evidence is provided to demonstrate that a salt incororated into the water employed to accelerate tree growth is present in the tree region."
"When a solid dielectric is subjected to a sufficiently high electrical stress, breakdown occurs with an abrupt increase in conductance. The signature of the breakdown includes a rapid transition from nonlocalized to localized conduction at a field of about 106 V/cm, a high breakdown current density, creation of hollow channels through the dielectric, and intense light emission from the damage channels."
"Electrical defects in cross-linked polyethylene insulated cables (XLPE cable) such as voids and contaminants in XLPE or characteristics of XLPE such as crystallinity and microporosity have been investigated in relation to the electrical characteristics of XLPE cable. Very small defects which can be observed with a microscope are being investigated. The authors studied the relation between the ac breakdown strength of XLPE cables and the void size in XLPE insulation considering the discharge inception in the voids."
"Encouraged by economic considerations, great efforts have been undertaken in the last decade to improve solid-state hv cable insulations. A multitude of additives was examined with the aim of upgrading the electric strength of polyethylene commonly used for hv cables. Hundreds of laboratory tests, mainly based on a method proposed by Kitchin and Pratt,1 were carried out; but most additives which increased tree inception voltage were not successful in experiments with full size or prototype cables. This is often due to the fact that in a remote ground electrode arrangement or flat brick-shaped specimen (often preferred to ascertain tree inception by optical observation) the correlation between test voltage and field strength at the needle tip may be influenced by the surface conductivity of the polymer. Additives increasing the surface conductivity of the examined polymer over a critical value depending on the geometry of the specimen and the properties of the embedding fluid may make the electric field between needle tip and the opposite electrode more uniform. Hence the field enhancement at the needle tip is decreased and the critical field strength leading to tree initiation can only be attained at higher test voltages.2"
"Among the water tree phenomena occurring in polyethylene (PE) and crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) insulation, a bow tie tree phenomenon occuring from micro voids (less than 10 μm) in polymer was the subject of our research. Bow tie tree inception mechanism and its behavior was examined by model simulation test using a miniature cable. The results of this experiment proved that the bow tie tree inception and propagation was related to the oxidation reaction in the polymer. Based on this fact, the water tree endurance of XLPE using various curing agents and additives was measured in a “sheet” model test. The test revealed that bow tie tree occurrence would be greatly affected by the oxidation stability of the polymer and the rigidity of molecular linkage of the polymer."
"In many practical insulation systems, failure initiates at asperities or inclusions at which very high localized fields exist. It is the purpose of this work to examine a method for modifying the insulation so that field grading will occur and the buildup of excessive fields be prevented. In order to accomplish this field grading, we propose to take advantage of the field-dependence of the conductivity of weak electrolytes, the so-called second Wien effect.1 The phenomenon is well understood and documented2 and involves the increased dissociation of weak electrolytes into ions with increased electrical fields, producing a higher conductivity in the high field region and therefore a reduction in this field."
"Recently the application of high power lasers to nuclear fusion, isotope separation, etc. necessitates clarification of the mechanism of optical breakdown as a limiting factor of laser materials. Moreover, there is a hope of investigating the intrinsic breakdown free from secondary effects such as electrode, space charge voids, etc. by using lasers. The authors1–14 have investigated dielectric breakdown of various dielectrics at optical frequencies by using Q-switched ruby and Nd-glass lasers. Several examples of optical breakdown fields (rms) by ruby laser are shown in Table 1 together with dc impulse values2»4 and energies of the band gap or the absorption edge. In many dielectrics except gases the optical breakdown field coincides fairly well with the dc value and is rather insensitive to the band gap. Based on these facts, we have proposed1–3 that impact ionization due to free electron acceleration by optical field (inverse Bremsstrahlung) is the predominant factor. This conclusion has been confirmed by several other authors.5,6 From the microwave breakdown theory,7 the energy gain rate of a free electron at the optical field Eo (rms) with the angular frequency ω is given by (dε/dt)E = e2E2o/m∗(ω2 + ν2), (1) where ε, e, m∗, and ν are electron average energy, charge, effective mass, and collision frequency respectively. The rate of energy gain decreases with increasing ω in the region ω >> ν. The average ionization frequency can be given by the occurrence of the TSD peak can be attributed to a relaxation process or to a thermodynamic phase transformation."

"Structural motions have been shown to influence such important polymer use properties as impact strength1 and time-dependent fracture.2 Processing is sometimes used to intentionally modify a polymer's structure and, thus, influence the motions the structure gives rise to. An example of this is poly(ethylene terephthalate) film, which is oriented during manufacture.3 While the oriented, commercial film is one of the most useful polymers available, the unoriented film is too brittle to handle and has no known uses."
"Boule has described recently a method for characterizing the dielectric relaxation and complex formation in solutions of polar molecules in a nonpolar complexing solvent.1 This work reports complementary procedures which may be used when long live complexes are formed between two polar or one polar and one nonpolar molecules in solutions containing a large amount of noninteracting nonpolar solvent. Two experimental systems are analyzed in detail below."
"The dielectric behavior of solutions of nitrobenzene, p-nitrobiphenyl, o-nitrobiphenyl, and 2, 2'-dinitrobiphenyl has been characterized in benzene at room temperatures and in supercooled o-terphenyl at lower temperatures. Previous work by Johari et. al.,1 and by Williams et al.,2 has shown that a dielectric microbrownian (α) process and a secondary (β) process is a characteristic feature of supercooled small molecule systems. It was also suggested that the frequency dependence of the normalized permittivity for the α process is a characteristic of the solvent in supercooled solutions. This work was undertaken to compare the effect of the size, shape, and orientation of the dipole moment on the dielectric relaxation process in both the liquid and supercooled liquid states."
"A major portion of the experimental investigations concerned with the electrical properties of non-crystalline solids has dealt with inorganic systems.1 Of those, most were covalent solids, and rather few were molecular solids. In our opinion, an important extension of the existing knowledge concerning the electronic properties of disordered systems and amorphous solids can be supplied by studying non-crystalline molecular solids, such as the conductive organic polymers. This paper reports some results of such a study on two high polymers of the polyacene quinone radical (PAQR) type."
"When sufficiently high voltages are applied to electrical insulators, electrical breakdown occurs at some time after the voltage is applied. This time delay to breakdown coupled to time of flight measurements of charge carrier mobilities obtained from peaks in the current waveform, provides information on insulation and conduction characteristics of the dielectrics. In addition, the bulk electric field and space charge distributions can be measured using the Kerr electro-optic effect for those dielectrics which become birefringent when stressed by high voltages, such as water1 and nitrobenzene.2 A short circuit analysis applied during the post breakdown period."
"If a semi-insulating layer is placed in a transverse conductivity gradient, the continuity of the steady-state current density implies the existence of a distortion of the otherwise uniform electric field, and consequently the presence of a space-charge distribution in the sample. This is a classical problem, and its solution is elementary, provided that the material conductivity is a true conductivity, namely is independent of the electric field."
"Trapping in the anodic oxide of sputter deposited 3-tantalum has been studied by numerous investigators using current-voltage-temperature (I-V-T), thermally stimulated currents, and photoconductivity techniques.1–8 Poole-Frenkel and ohmic conduction data have been shown to be consistent with the existence of an ionized 1 eV trap.1 Aris et. al.,4 in their study of conduction in Ta2O5 on Ta foil, have observed space charge limited currents and find traps with 1.15 and 0.4 eV activation energies. Deep traps are also observed at 0.8 and 0.53 eV in Ta2O5 on silicon.5 Photocurrent spectroscopy data indicate the presence of deep traps at photon energies of 1.5, 2.1 and 2.8 eV.6–8"
"The Hughes Phoenix radar transmitter uses a liquid dielectric as a coolant. In order to withstand the high temperatures in the transmitter, a silicate ester (the ester of silica acid and 2-ethyl butanol) has been chosen. One of the disadvantages of this liquid is the degradation products caused by contaminants such as water, organic acids, and inorganic salts. Since the radar systems may be repaired aboard an aircraft carrier, contamination of the liquid dielectric coolant is likely and it is important to monitor the concentrations of these contaminants. This is particularly true for the high voltage radar transmitter. The amount of ionizable contaminant is measured by monitoring the volume resistivity of the coolant. The water content of the coolant is measured by an electronic water sensor."
"Conduction processes in polyethylene under high field depend upon the electrode-polymer interface and the ambient atmosphere. It was reported last year1 that the conduction of low density and high density polyethylene is sensitive to Shottky type emission from the cathode in air as well as in vacuum except in the presence of air between electrodes and polymer. This report brings further details concerning the influence of the ambient atmosphere."

"If power cables insulated with compressed SF6 gas are to have widespread application, their installed cost must be substantially reduced from the present level. The 3-phase, as opposed to the single-phase, configuration has been viewed as a means for reducing cable cost since it allows the use of materials for the outer pipe which are less onerous to purchase and install.1,2 Another item affecting the cost of such a cable is the solid dielectric spacer required at frequent intervals to support the conductors. Post-type spacers, which are inherently less voluminous and easier to manufacture than the disc-type or cone-type spacer configurations commonly used in isolated-phase bus construction, offer the possibility of realizing appreciable economies, provided they are optimally designed. This paper reports on the development of a design method intended to minimize the volume of post-type spacers for 3-phase SF6 gas-insulated cables."
"In the range of quasi uniform fields, three different electrode configurations were employed in measurments of the dielectric strength, using various SF6/N2 mixtures up to a maximum volumetric nitrogen concentration of 50%. At a pressure of 3.5 bar and a volumetric concentration of nitrogen from 30 to 40%, the dielectric strength of the mixture remained equal to that of pure SF6 gas. The results in the first instance applying only to gas gaps, were verified using production SF6-insulated metal encapsulated switchgear."
"It is generally considered that paper formation, if it is good, will have little effect on the dielectric breakdown strength of oil-impregnated Kraft paper for oF cable. However, little is known about defining good formation quantitatively."
"Recently breakdown and conduction in liquefied gases have been studied by many investigators. The earliest measurements of electric breakdown in liquefied gases were predominantly undertaken to develop understanding of the breakdown mechanism.1–4 With increasing interest in practical application of liquefied gases, for example super-conducting cable for power transmission lines, engineering research has also been done.5"
"Economic studies1 have indicated that vacuum insulated, liquid nitrogen cooled, underground transmission lines have the best prospect of becoming competitive with overhead transmission. The cost comparison shown in Figure 1 has been prepared from these data."
"The voltage at which an insulator in vacuum flashes over depends on the angle between the insulator-vacuum interface and the electric field.1,3 In the work reported here, fast high-voltage pulses (3 ns risetime) and nanosecond time resolution permit measurement of the time delay between voltage application and breakdown. Measurements indicate that much of the angular variation in breakdown voltage observed under fast-pulsed conditions is associated with a seconary electron emission avalanche1 5 at the insulator surface preceding breakdown. The voltage dependence of the time delay provides insight into the transition from electron avalanche to low-impedance discharge. Furthermore, there is evidence that a different mechanism may lead to surface flashover within a restricted range of electric field angles."
"High-voltage holdoff of solid insulators bewteen electrodes in vacuum depends strongly on insulator shape. The angle between the applied field and the insulator interface is believed to be the fundamental dependence. A detailed calculation of the electric fields about solid insulators of various shapes gives us insight as to the reason for this dependence. The breakdown field near the cathode-insulator junction appears to be constant if the enhancement of the applied field is considered. This enhancement is created not only by insulator geometry, but also by insulator surface charging effects."
"Arcover across the surface of a solid dielectric in a gaseous ambient is probably one of the oldest problems in the use of electrical insulation. Much work has been done and is being done on arcover in gases1–3. However most of this work is concerned with power generation equipment rather than with electronic devices."
"The large number of applications of epoxy resins in the electrical industry originates an increasing interest in the behavior of these materials under endurance tests. In particular, several authors have studied_the action of partial discharges on these dielectrics1–5, which, in practice, are often subjected to this kind of stress. In the present paper, the first results of a research program on the electrical aging of epoxy resins are reported. A set of tests were made on epoxy resin disks, stressed by normal partial discharges in a modified Lacoste cell in a flowing nitrogen atmosphere under ac voltage. Tests were made on aged specimens by means of ir spectrophotometry, in order to investigate the alterations in the material due to partial discharges. To obtain a better knowledge of the surface degradation for different degrees of aging, photomicrographs were taken."

"In this paper we report some of the results obtained in a study of triggered breakdown in technical grade transformer oil. The gap studied consisted of two brass hemispheres of 12 cm diameter with the gap axis mounted horizontally in an oil tank. One of these electrodes was connected to a 60 Hz high voltage transformer, the other was permanently grounded and contained within it a 1.5 mm diameter tungsten rod set in a 3.2 mm diameter hole to form a trigger gap of approximately 0.85 mm. The tip of the trigger pin was mounted flush with the hemispherical surface. Figure 1 shows a simplified diagram of the trigger circuit. Additional circuitry permitted firing the trigger circuit at any phase position of the 60 Hz voltage applied to the main."
"It is well known1,2 that small (∼1 μm diam.) conducting particles can reduce the electrical breakdown strength of mineral oil, and according to Krasucki's1 theory, breakdown is associated with the formation and growth in the liquid of a vapor bubble created by the presence of a particle. Although it is not certain, electrical discharges associated with the small particles may influence the breakdown mechanism, and consequently, the particle size and shape could be very important. Dakin and Hughes2 investigated the behavior of metal spheres of 1 to 3 mm diameter in mineral oil, but most studies reported in the literature deal with small particles which are difficult to observe, and associated microdischarges which are extremely difficult to measure. For these reasons and because of a lack of published information in regard to large irregularly shaped conducting particles in mineral oil, in the work reported here, large (>1 mm diam.) copper wire particles and 2.5 cm long (10 mg weight) slivers of different metals were used in the present study."
"With the dual objectives of providing case studies for the teaching of electromagnetic field theory and of documenting electrohydrodynamic phenomena of basic and practical interest, the film “Electric Fields and Moving Media” was produced by the Educational Development Center for the National Committee on Electrical Engineering Films. Because they give substance and motivation to field solutions that are generally regarded as being classical, the sequence of case studies presented is useful in the teaching of basic field theory1, 2 or a more advanced subject concerned with electromechanics.4 In a discussion aimed at researchers concerned with electromechanical effects in semi-insulating liquids, connections are made here between the case studies and documented research. Reviews of electrohydrodynamics concerned with coupling through charge monolayers,5 and the categorization of electrohydrodynamic phenomena as a whole6 give further insights."
"A theory is presented giving far-field radiation patterns and surface-wave behavior for vertically polarized antennas located at zero height over flat ground, with a surface impedance which can be discontinuous along a radius from the antenna. The theory is based on the radiation from the surface electric and magnetic currents as determined by the Sommerfeld attenuation function. Both sky-wave and surface-wave solutions are obtained simultaneously, with applications to ground screens, recovery phenomena, Fresnel zones, and similar engineering problems discussed with examples. In general, the results agree with those obtained using the compensation theorem."
"Digital radar reflectivity data may be used to estimate the slant path attenuation which would have been obtained on a ground-to-satellite path using a frequency higher than that of the original radar. The crucial role of the small intense cells is illustrated and the necessity of maintaining the radar data at their highest spatial resolution is discussed. A technique to simulate path diversity systems is demonstrated for a squall line case and shows that diversity pair orientation perpendicular to the elongation of the precipitation line studied yields the best diversity performance."
"The problem of microwave thermal emission from a half-space random medium is solved. We consider a laminar structure which has a nonuniform temperature distribution in the vertical direction. A radiative transfer approach is applied. For constant absorption and scattering coefficients, the brightness temperature is determined by a simple closed-form formula. Physical interpretations and numerical results are illustrated and discussed for the various cases."
"It is shown that the correlation ellipse bears no relationship to the “average” shape of irregularities in the amplitude pattern formed at the ground from the interference of radio waves reflected or scattered from the ionosphere. The concept that the correlation ellipse should be related to the average shape arose because it was considered that the cross-correlation coefficient for zero delay between two fading records (with spatial separation r) was related to the average normalized amplitude of the irregularities at a displacement r from the center of the average irregularity. As shown in this paper, the cross-correlation coefficient for zero delay depends only on the mean fading period and the mean and variance of the time delays between corresponding fades. It retains its usual significance only if ris in the direction of drift."
"Irradiance fluctuations of a plane wave propagating through a strongly refracting thin turbulent slab are treated. The parabolic wave equation of the fourth-order moment of the field is solved by an operational method and the triple integral form of the solution is obtained. Numerical results of the variance function show the saturation effect and the values of the covariance are given for the under- and over-saturation regions."
"The estimation of the power spectrum of a time series by fitting a finite autoregressive model to the data has recently found widespread application in the physical sciences. The extension of this method to the analysis of vector time series is presented here through its application to ULF waves observed in the magnetosphere by the ATS 6 synchronous satellite. Autoregressive spectral estimates of the power and cross-power spectra of these waves are computed with computer programs developed by the author and are compared with the corresponding Blackman-Tukey spectral estimates. The resulting spectral density matrices are then analyzed to determine the direction of propagation and polarization of the observed waves."
"Equations for the two-frequency two-position mutual coherence functions are derived under the usual parabolic and Markov approximations. These equations are then solved numerically. It is shown that the mutual coherence functions occur naturally in the study of pulse distortion through a random communication channel and in the investigation of signal correlations. Contour plots of correlation functions show the possibility of having equal values at two frequency separations for a given spatial separation. This behavior is explainable in terms of overlapping Fresnel zones."
"A modulated beam of charged particles is represented as an infinite line antenna carrying a current distribution traveling along it at a prescribed speed. The radiation from such an antenna is calculated theoretically, and typical patterns are presented for conditions appropriate to the ionosphere and magnetosphere."
"When cylindrical electron beams, density modulated at a prescribed repetition frequency (f ≈ 3 to 6 MHz), are injected into plasmas along a magnetic field, cylindrical electron Bernstein waves are found to be launched nearly perpendicular to the electron beams. The wave amplitude and frequency are controlled easily. The mechanism of the excitation of cylindrical electron Bernstein waves by electron beams is investigated theoretically to explain the experimental results."
"With the aid of a two-dimensional integral equation formulation, the ground wave propagation of electromagnetic waves transmitted by a vertical electric dipole over an inhomogeneous flat earth is investigated. For the configuration in which a ground wave is propagating across an “island” on a flat earth, the modulus and argument of the attenuation function have been computed. The results for the two-dimensional treatment are significantly more accurate in detail than the calculations using a one-dimensional integral equation."
"Tropospheric refraction introduces errors into radar and radio communication systems by causing radio waves to travel along a curved path and at a speed which changes with position. Common error correction techniques, such as making estimates of refractive effects from surface refractivity, rely implicitly on the assumption that the troposphere is horizontally stratified. This study demonstrates that such an assumption may be unwarranted especially at elevation angles below 10°, and that such reliance can lead to substantial errors. The end product of this research is a system which employs atmospheric emission measurements in addition to surface refractivity to estimate refractive bending and range error. This approach relies on the similar dependence of refraction and emission on atmospheric parameters to account for nonhorizontal stratification. Performance results establish that such a system need employ no more than one radiometer channel to provide potential error reduction of more than 40% over conventional approaches, along with a potentially automated, real-time operational capability."
"Microwave data acquired over the Great Salt Lake Desert area by sensors aboard Skylab and Nimbus 5 indicate that the microwave emission and backscatter were strongly influenced by contributions from subsurface layers of sediment saturated with brine. This phenomenon was observed by Skylab's S-194 radiometer operating at 1.4 GHz, S-193 RADSCAT (Radiometer-Scatterometer) operating at 13.9 GHz, and the Nimbus 5 ESMR (Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer) operating at 19.35 GHz. The availability of ESMR data over an 18-month period allowed an investigation of temporal variations."
"Whistlers observed on records of the OGO-4 satellite during the sunset/sunrise hours show evidence of both the proresonance (PR) and prolongitudinal (PL) mode of propagation. By tracing rays in a model magnetosphere suitable for these hours, the whistlers observed on these records are reproduced. The upper cutoff frequency presented in the walking trace whistlers appears naturally as a consequence of the inclusion of latitudinal gradients in the electron density model. A new whistler trace is predicted which appears as a consequence of the transition from the PR to the PL mode of propagation."
"Radio scintillation on satellite signals caused by small-scale irregularities in F-region ionospheric electron density can be an important limitation on earth-satellite communication and navigation systems. Scintillation imposes distortion in both amplitude and phase on wideband signals. In the present work, the shallow-modulated phase screen theory is developed in terms of coherence bandwidth including a model based on a turbulent-like power-law description of the irregularities. The model results usually show a greater coherence bandwidth in the signal phase than in the signal amplitude. Therefore, systems that require phase coherence over a large bandwidth should be less affected than those requiring amplitude coherence."
"Bora's method is applied to the time-dependent wave equation. Exact solutions, valid for all wavelengths, are obtained for the first-order perturbation terms for monochromatic plane and spherical waves propagating in random media with stationary temporal fluctuations. It is shown that the temporal fluctuations of the medium can be neglected if the temporal frequencies of the fluctuations are much less than the frequency of the propagating wave and if the propagation time from the transmitter to receiver is much less than the coherence time of the medium. In the atmosphere for the case where (λ30/l40)L ≪ 1, where l0 is the inner scale of turbulence, log-amplitude and phase covariance functions were calculated for the polarized and depolarized fluctuations of plane waves propagating in slightly different directions. Numerical evaluation revealed that the polarized log-amplitude fluctuations decorrelate for angular separations on the order of tan−1 [(λ0/L)1/2] while phase fluctuations decorrelate for angular separations on the order of tan−1(L0/L), where L0 is the outer scale of turbulence."
"The properties of an electric field probe that consists of two mutually perpendicular conductors attached to the end of a long coaxial line are investigated with a view to minimizing the pickup by the cable. The structure is treated as a junction-loaded crossed-wire antenna. Coupled integral equations for the currents are derived and solved approximately. It is shown that the contribution to the voltage across the load can be kept relatively small compared with the contributions by the active elements of the probe if a correct design is maintained. The analysis is carried out specifically for a normally incident plane wave with components of the electric field parallel to both the cable and the elements of the probe."
"Using a perturbation method, we consider the effect of a simple two-dimensional model on the electromagnetic fields at the surface of the Earth for a postulated downcoming plane wave. We examine the calculated change in the surface impedance and wave tilt due to lateral inhomogeneities. It is found that the magnetic wave tilt (Hz/Hx) is most seriously affected by such anomalies. This may have important consequences on electromagnetic probing of nonuniform portions of the Earth's crust."
"The results of the first in-situ measurement at VLF of the complex permittivities of deep Antarctic ice are presented as functions of depth, projected along the vertical. Measurements made with an electrically short dipole probe at five frequencies to a depth of 1500 m below the ice surface are reported. Temperature is identified as a dominant factor affecting the ice permittivity. This fact, coupled with the measurements of complex permittivity to 1500 m depth, is used to estimate ice permittivities from 1500 m to the bottom of the ice sheet at 2164 m. Comparison of the in-situ measurements with those of surface measurements is made; it is concluded that for the purpose of VLF antenna and propagation studies the Antarctic ice sheet cannot be considered to be an isotropic homogeneous material, but must be treated at least as a horizontally stratified medium whose dielectric and loss properties vary in the vertical direction with temperature."
"A quasistatic theory has been constructed for predicting low frequency sheath impedance changes produced on spacecraft sounding antennas as a result of intense RF emissions by them. The theory involves calculation of time-independent sheath profiles around an infinite cylindrical antenna in a collisionless plasma, using a numerical scheme which includes the time-averaged repelling force on electrons due to a nonlinear effect of the RF near field of the antenna. These sheath profiles then yield values of static sheath capacitance and conductance per unit antenna length. The theory includes a more accurate electron current calculation than in the earlier treatments by the authors. Results are presented for a range of parameters applicable to spacecraft sounding conditions. In most cases, the quasistatic sheath capacitance and conductance both decrease as RF amplitude increases. At large enough RF amplitudes, the capacitance becomes almost independent of antenna potential and Debye ratio."
"The multifrequency satellite radio beacon enables the measurement of the columnar electron content of the ionosphere and plasmasphere along the ray path and its spatial and temporal structure. Measurements include modulation phase, Faraday rotation, and amplitude. The characteristics of the beacon transmitter and its design are presented together with the design of the Boulder receiver and antennas and the calibration procedures. A shape factor F is defined which depends on the electron density and geomagnetic field distributions. It is found that F varies by about 30% from day to night. It is shown that the ratio of the plasmaspheric content to total content varies from about 0.08 during the day to about 0.35 at night. Other examples which are presented to illustrate the uses of the radio beacon include sunrise effects, solar flare enhancements of total content, and the ionospheric storms of early July 1974."
"The solution of the wave equation for a plane stratified medium is obtained by using a fourth-order accurate numerical integration technique. The general solution thus obtained is described in terms of four characteristic waves, two upgoing and two downgoing. A compact expression for the coupling coefficients Γij (i ≠ j), which is suitable for numerical calculation, is also derived. These techniques are then used in a quantitative study of transmission coefficients, coupling factors, and wave structures through the crossover region where the proton whistlers are generated. The negligible influence of collisions upon the transmitted energies in the two upgoing modes is discussed. The results are then compared with previous works in which the thin-slab full-wave method was used."
"During the period 1000–1030 UT on March 16, 1972, a very dynamic auroral event occurred in the latitudinal region from College to Fort Yukon, Alaska. Simultaneous observations of this auroral event were made with an all-sky camera, a geomagnetic meridian scanning photometer, an incoherent scatter radar, a three-component magnetometer, a 30-MHz riometer, and two VHF/UHF auroral radars. The basic purpose of this report is to illustrate the advantages of such coordinated measurements and the possibilities for future experiments. These preliminary results point out many relationships which, although not hitherto unknown, are important to the understanding of the auroral ionosphere. Paramount among these are (1) intense discrete auroral forms (> 25 kR in 4278 Å) are associated with enhanced E-layer electron densities near 106 electrons/cm3; (2) the riometer data and the height of maximum Ne from the incoherent scatter radar suggest that few energetic (> 40 kev) particles were precipitating during this event; (3) enhanced regions of VHF backscatter seem to be associated with eastward and westward electrojet current systems but do not spatially correspond to the regions of high Ne or bright auroral forms; and (4) the collective data yield a description which indicates that this period is associated with the Harang discontinuity region of the auroral current systems."
"The antenna problem consisting of exciting an infinitely long horizontal thin wire with an arbitrary distribution of impressed electric field along the axis of the wire is discussed. The special case of excitation by a delta function voltage source is solved. The current on the antenna is found as a sum of two residue (discrete) contributions and two branch integration (continuous) contributions. The far field and orthogonality properties of both the discrete and continuous modes are discussed. Finally, expressions are given for the current on the antenna. From this current the input conductance of the antenna can be obtained."
"In this paper, properties of stationary waves of the transverse magnetic (TM) type which have two electric field components, i.e., axial and transverse ones, in a nonlinear self-focusing medium are discussed. Waves of the TM type are categorized into a solitary wave and several types of waves oscillating in the transverse plane. Analytical expressions of oscillating waves are obtained by using an asymptotic expansion and its extension for the large nonlinearity as well as the small one of the medium. A solitary wave is also discussed numerically, and some differences between the solitary waves of TE and TM types are mentioned."
"The conventional wisdom that the incoherent portion of the forward-scattered signal off a rough surface approaches a constant asymptote as the roughness parameter (RP) grows large is reexamined and shown to be incorrect. Essential use is made of the fact that the incoherent-scattered component has been observed to come mainly from the specular direction. With this approximation, a remarkably close fit to the data is achieved when one further assumes that the surface is illuminated by a very narrow beam. Asymptotic expressions show that the rms of the incoherent portion of the signal first rises linearly with RP, and then eventually falls off as the inverse square root of the RP. This general shape is independent of the form of the surface autocorrelation function."
"Increasing accuracy in the conversion of h'(f) to N(h) profiles is obtained by increasing the order of the polynomial used to interpolate between measured points. Linear and parabolic lamination techniques correspond to first- and second-order interpolation. Fourth-order interpolation (as in the 5-term overlapping polynomial method) is about optimum. In comparing different methods, it is essential that fixed boundary conditions be employed; when this is done an adjacent polynomial technique is much less accurate than overlapping polynomials. All methods (including least-squares procedures) are equally sensitive to errors in the virtual height data. Possible procedures for reducing the errors caused by underlying and valley ionization are critically reviewed. It is concluded that, in general, only a single parameter is necessary or desirable to describe these regions. This parameter can be determined from ordinary and extraordinary ray measurements, at any latitude."
"Comparisons of the variation of atmospheric radio noise intensities for 20–24 hr to sunspot numbers have been completed. Statistical dependence between the noise intensities and sunspot numbers was found for different seasons at a number of frequencies for many locations in the global network of ARN-2 noise recorders. The noise intensities generally tended to decrease with sunspot number in the range from 50 kHz to 5 MHz, which is presumed to be due to increases in residual ionospheric absorption during nighttime. At frequencies greater than 5 MHz, noise intensities increased with sunspot number in many cases, which would be expected from our present knowledge of ionospheric behavior in the HF range. By convention, CCIR treats year-to-year variation in the noise intensities as random and includes them in the prediction uncertainty σFam (for which one value is given at a frequency for a seasonal time block for all locations) in system performance evaluation. An error analysis on a global basis shows that a large portion of the year-to-year variability is due to sunspot variation. This suggests the possibility of improved noise estimates."
"An improved matrix method of calculating the solutions of wave equations in a horizontally stratified anisotropic medium is described. An inhomogeneous medium is divided into a number of thin horizontal and homogeneous slabs. The solutions of a differential equation with constant coefficients in each slab are connected by applying the boundary conditions, and the wave fields are given as the power series expansion of wave fields. In calculating the wave fields, a matrix is divided into two matrices for two independent solutions and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalizing process is applied to prevent numerical swamping. Comparisons are made between this and other full wave methods regarding step size and computer time, and this method is found to be more efficient than the full wave method especially at high frequency wave fields. The magnetoionic modes separated from the resultant wave are shown for a model ionosphere."
"A novel formulation of the complex power radiated from planar antenna apertures is presented in terms of the cross-correlation functions of the aperture fields. The analysis makes use of the Fourier transform relationship between the cross-correlation function and the cross spectral power density. We start with the well-known Poynting vector integration which involves plane wave intrinsic impedances and which can be given in five different forms according to the choice of the field representation. Through simple mathematical manipulations we arrive at the cross-correlation form which is applicable not only to simple apertures but also to nonperiodic as well as periodic arrays either with or without dielectric sheets. This formulation is specially useful in analyzing aperture problems having a statistical nature where the conventional Poynting vector approach is not directly applicable."
"Using an idealized coaxial model, we consider the transmission, in the frequency range from 20 to 1000 kHz, down a mine hoist shaft from a symmetric source at the surface. The shaft is circular in cross section and the metal hoist cable is represented by a concentric conductor. To facilitate the analysis, the source is idealized as a voltage-excited annular slot in a circular ground plane that is located in the air-earth interface. The earth itself is taken to be a homogeneous conducting half space. Using a modal type analysis, the total power supplied to the annular slot is calculated as the sum of the power delivered to the lower half space, the power dissipated at the air-earth interface and the power radiated into the atmosphere. Using these results, the relative power transmitted down the shaft to a specified depth is estimated. The resulting transmission efficiency is found to be almost completely dependent on the attenuation characteristics of the dominant TEM mode in the shaft."
"Through application of the basic equation of geometrical optics, the eikonal equation, we have derived an expression for the refractive defocusing of a critical ray in a medium which has circular symmetry. The equation of the ray itself is simply a circle, since by definition its radius of curvature is exactly the same as its distance from the center of symmetry. This mathematical development has a practical significance in that it permits for the first time the calculation of the strength of a signal which travels in the atmosphere of a planet at a fixed critical height. Our specific interest in this matter was due to the probable existence of such a critical ray about 33 km high in the atmosphere of Venus; at this altitude the pressure and temperature are reasonably Earth-like and, as a result, some advanced space exploration studies have considered telecommunication by means of the critical ray (J. E. Blamont, personal communication, 1974). Through the application of the result given here, the strength of such a propagation mode can be determined. The result also has potential applications in geocentric studies and in other media which possess either spherical or cylindrical symmetry."
"In this paper, integral and differential equations are derived for the two-frequency mutual coherence function in a random distribution of stationary and moving particles. The differential equation is then solved for a plane wave case, and the coherent bandwidth is obtained for both the weak and strong fluctuation cases. Using the two-frequency correlation function, the output pulse shape is calculated for different particle densities. When the optical distance is small compared with unity, the pulse shape is substantially unchanged, but a long tail develops. When the optical distance is large, the coherent bandwidth is reduced and considerable pulse spread and delay occur. Numerical calculations are given for a nanosecond optical pulse propagating through cloud. It is shown that in dense cloud (density 0.5 × 109 m−3), the pulse delay and spread are 3 and 1.28 μsec respectively over a distance of 5 km. This agrees with available experimental data."
"The concept of nonmetallic, resistive, and “conductive” sheets is discussed, and for a plane electromagnetic wave incident on a half plane composed of any one of these materials, the exact solution of the boundary value problem is obtained for incidence in a plane perpendicular to the edge. In each case the edge diffraction coefficient is proportional to a product of split functions arising from the Wiener-Hopf method of solution. Since each function depends on only one angular variable, the coefficient for arbitrary directions of incidence and observation is expressible in terms of the backscattering coefficient for edge-on incidence on a half plane with an equivalent impedance. This last is rather easily computed, and data are presented to illustrate the scattering behavior."

"The life story of Marconi is too well documented to need detailed repetition, but there are certain facts about his early years which bear directly upon his quite remarkable success and indeed which relate to the early development of the subject of wireless telegraphy."
"Developments in the theory of radio propagation in the first half of the twentieth century are briefly traced from early work on diffraction around the curved surface of the Earth to the discovery of the magnetosphere with the aid of whistlers. Attention is drawn to the possibility that Marconi may have been initially inspired by the concept of the Atlantic Ocean as a giant cost-free telephone wire linking the European and American continents."
"Short wave forecasting began in the late 1930s with rather crude, more global methods. The main steps of the development until the middle of the 1950s are described. Analytical methods have now replaced the original ones."
"The application of scattered radio waves to geophysical investigations is reviewed. The occurrence of ground scatter depends on the smoothness of the reflecting layer and limits for the inhomogeneity may be given. Direct backscatter occurs from field-aligned irregularities in the auroral belt and movements may be derived from Doppler shift. The location and temporal movement of the two predominant precipitation belts are observed. Meteor scatter is strongly aspect sensitive and is used for deriving physical properties of the meteorites. The analysis of scattering in transequatorial short wave propagation points to a gravity wave induced system of eastward travelling field-aligned inhomogeneities. Incoherent scatter has proved a successful tool for investigating many important parameters of the ionosphere. Satellite scintillations are helpful in mapping the irregularities of the electron content. They may be used for determining the height of the irregularities by radio wave holography. Scattering of microwaves on the ground is becominga useful tool for geoexploration. Scattering processes in the troposphere are dealt with in a paper by C. G. Little in this issue."
"In the early days of upper atmosphere research, radio signals were the most useful diagnostic for studying ionospheric processes. During the space era, it has become possible to measure directly solar radiations that are screened from reaching the surface of the Earth, to measure the structure and composition of the upper atmosphere directly with in situ sensors, to conduct plasma experiments in space, to carry out remote sensing of the atmosphere from space, and to measure directly transionospheric radio propagation properties of the ionosphere. This recent dominance of space research methods in ionospheric research is becoming less marked as satellite opportunities diminish and greater emphasis is placed on studies of the ionosphere using new types of ground-based instrumentation. Looking to the 4980s, the principal space flight opportunities will be associated with Spacelab, and new initiatives in ionospheric research will depend on a combined approach using all available methods for studying the dynamics and structure of the ionosphere. Future possibilities are outlined, with particular reference to new radio experiments on the ionosphere."
"A statistical analysis of 90 selected ionospheric storms has been carried out from MUF(ZERO)F2 and MUF(3000)F2 measured in Italy from 1958 to 1972. Typical behavior with regard to season, storm intensity, and statistical dispersion is shown for forecasting purposes."
"The dispersion relation of gravity waves propagating in a conducting atmosphere in the presence of a magnetic field has been evaluated. Extreme simplifying assumptions have been adopted in an effort to reach simple results. In this way, the applicability of the results to any real situation is highly doubtful. However, a qualitative and intuitive understanding of the influence of conductivity and magnetic field on the dispersion relation of gravity waves is more easily reached."
"Data on around-the-world (RTW) propagation obtained at Ithaca, N.Y., between the years 1965 and 1968 are described and discussed using a ray optics approach. The role of the oblique ionospheric shells that are known to exist near the 75° dip of the northern geomagnetic field in producing RTW echoes is emphasized. The possibility of utilizing RTW waves for ionospheric sounding is pointed out."
"The successes of Marconi in establishing radio communications, first with LF and VLF, and later with HF waves, are interpreted in terms of the (range)(rate)1/2 relationship of space communications. The evolution of the technology from the late thirties to that associated with present-day communications satellites characterized by high capacity and reliability is outlined."
"Technological developments in the microwave spectrum have made possible highly accurate radio systems for position determination. Most of these systems depend upon measurements of the signal transit time or of the differential transit time for different portions of the received wavefaront. In practice, the performance of such systems when operating in the Earth's atmosphere is usually limited by the random signal velocity. This effect is a consequence of the variable density and water vapor distribution throughout the normal troposphere. Theoretical and experimental work has provided a useful degree of understanding of these tropospheric effects and some progress has been made in reducing them in certain applications."
"Radio wave interactions with the atmosphere and its constituents have been used to derive information on many aspects of the troposphere. Passively (i.e., in the radiometric mode), they have been used to measure temperature profiles and the water vapor and liquid water contents of the atmosphere, and to identify tornadic storms. In the active mode, three-dimensional fields of precipitation and velocity have been measured. These have permitted studies of horizontal and vertical velocities, vorticity, convergence, turbulence spectra, turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates, and fluxes of momentum and kinetic energy, as well as studies of such atmospheric phenomena as thermal plumes, convective cells, internal gravity waves, breaking waves, and convective and orographic storms."
"The importance of using frequencies above 10 GHz in satellite communication systems arises partly from the saturation of the bands presently in use. In addition, above 10 GHz, frequency bands have been specifically assigned to satellite communication systems, allowing earth stations to be located more freely, particularly near or within the cities. Directive multibeam antennas are also more easily realizable on board the satellites. These advantages are of particular relevance for domestic satellites. On the other hand, the propagation of such frequencies is mainly affected by rain attenuation."
"In microwave links, atmospheric inhomogeneities and terrain irregularities produce random fluctuations of the electromagnetic field whose comprehensive description requires a statistical approach. To this purpose several functions can be defined and measured. Among them, the normalized mutual coherence function, or complex degree of coherence, has proved to be the most convenient both for direct applications and for simple measuring procedure. The Istituto di Elettronica of the University of Rome is carrying on measurements of the degree of coherence of microwave fields. It has been measured for different paths at 9.4 GHz by using waveguide interferometric systems of various configurations which have been applied to the determination of the coherence function for several distances in the horizontal plane, and to the evaluation of its anisotropy in a plane transverse to the direction of propagation for different meteorological conditions."
"A rather ingenious communication technique is being developed for use in Belgian coal mines. The idea is to use a two-wire transmission line or equivalent loosely braided coaxial cable that can be suspended from the upper wall. A transmitter placed in the vicinity of the line excites a strongly unbalanced mode that normally would propagate like a coaxial or TEM mode with relatively high attenuation. The key step in the Belgian system, and the closely related French system, is to convert this unbalanced mode to a balanced mode that is much less attenuated because the return current flows mostly in the second wire rather than through the surrounding rock. The physical basis of this system has many similarities with the leaky feeder device described by Martin and used in British coal mines. We summarize the analysis of the propagation characteristics for an idealized mine tunnel of circular cross section. The extension to a rectangular tunnel is also considered. Some comparison is made with relevant experimental data. Actually, we deal only with the twin open wire pair that is the basic ingredient of the so-called INIEX/Deryck system. However, as suggested above, the leaky braided cable system and the slotted cylindrical shielded cables have common features. The important point is that propagation modes which depend on current flow in the tunnel walls will suffer excessive attenuation while modes which utilize the second conductor as a return current path will have less attenuation."
"Recent evolution of telecommunication networks has been strongly influenced by two main trends: an increase of radio (microwave radio links, satellite links, and mobile services) with respect to cable communication, and a rapidly progressing development of digital transmission techniques compared with analogic techniques. The first tendency leads to saturation of the frequency bands presently used for radioelectric systems and hence the need of going to higher as well as yet unused bands. Digital systems on the other hand are particularly prone to interruptions even of very short duration and such cuts can only be tolerated for extremely low time percentages. The object of this communication is to study the role of propagation conditions in the future solution of these problems, imposing a limit on the distance between repeaters or using diversity techniques."
"Anomalous refractive profiles and inversion layer structures at the Western Test Range, Vandenberg, California, were measured using airborne sensors. When the marine inversion layer was traced inland, the refractive gradient was observed to undergo upward warping, waving, dilation, lensing, and splitting. Refraction corrections computed using airborne-measured, full cross sections along the radar line of sight were at times more than twice as large as those corrections resulting from single-point radiosonde or aircraft spiral inputs, which must assume a spherically stratified atmosphere. Ray-tracing techniques could reliably predict the location of actually observed radio holes (areas where radar loss-of-lock occurs) only when inputs from full, three-dimensional, airborne cross sections were used."
"That the F2 layer is bifurcated into two sublayers and that this structure travels poleward has been revealed by previous computations published by the author. Examination of vertical sounding data shows that such a travelling bifurcation occurs mainly near noon in the seasons other than June solstitial months during years of high solar activity. It is found that the formation of bifurcation is principally due to the combined effect of the upward drift, which changes from increasing to decreasing at 1000 LT, and the slow diffusion. The effects of other parameters on the bifurcation and ionospheric characteristics and the cause of the bifurcation which occurs at sunrise are also studied. The continuity equation of electron density is then solved with appropriate values of ionospheric parameters suggested from the above study. The computed foF2 at the equator during daytime is a very good reproduction of the observed one, and does not show any bifurcation as usually observed. The causes of agreement or disagreement between the computed and the observed values of critical frequency and height of layer peak are discussed."
"The impedance of a short electric dipole antenna has been measured from rockets in the ionosphere. The EIDI I experiment was launched in conditions where the plasma was expected to be nearly isotropic (operating frequencies 4.48 and 6.09 MHz, foF2 ≃ 9 MHz, fH ≃ 1 MHz). It was designed to detect and measure or to eliminate most of the unwanted effects which complicated the data reduction of previous experiments: outgassing, telemetry radiation, etc. The number of parameters measured simultaneously on board (impedances with variable bias and RF excitation level, resonance frequencies, Te, dc current drawn by the antennas, vehicle potential) and from the ground or an overhead satellite was large enough to provide numerous cross checks and to determine the sheath dimensions. The impedance is very weakly spin-modulated over most of the flight; the collision frequency is very low (ν/ω ≃ 10−5) unlike some of the previous experiments where collision losses were dominant. The measured values of the impedance are given as a function of $X = f_{p}^{2}/f^{2}$ where the other parameters are known."
"The interpretation of the experiment EIDI I, described in a companion paper, is undertaken. A relatively complete calculation of the impedance is done including the effect of the temperature of the plasma by using the Vlasov equation and hydrodynamic equations, the structure of the sheath using a simple model of it, the collision frequency computed for an equilibrium plasma, and an estimation of various other small effects (wake, ionospheric gradient, motion of ions, …). The result so obtained is in very good agreement with the experiment for the most part but a strong discrepancy appears in the resistance when X > 1. This indicates that the main features of the theory are correct except that a loss mechanism is missing; some hypothetical ones are discussed."
"Previously a mode conversion model was presented which allowed for both the vertical inhomogeneity and anisotropy of the ionosphere. Horizontal inhomogeneity along the direction of propagation was modeled by a slab approximation. The required height gain functions were determined by full-wave solutions and their associated integrals evaluated numerically. In this paper results of a modified mode conversion model are compared with those of the original. In the modified model, height gain functions are discarded above some height h in the guide and are approximated below height h by Airy functions. Merits of the modified version are that a full-wave program for height gains is not required, and that the associated integrals may be performed analytically. An obvious disadvantage is the free parameter h. The modified mode conversion model can be implemented with about the same ease as a WKB method and has one distinct advantage over the latter, namely, that mode numbering in any given slab is immaterial. Results of both mode conversion models are compared at several frequencies in the VLF band with experimental sunrise results obtained with a multifrequency oblique sounder system located on the island of Hawaii. In particular, comparisons are made with vertical field measurements in southern California. Approximate agreement is found. Discrepancies between modelling results and data are generally larger than the differences between the two mode conversion models."
"A “worst case” of scintillation activity is presented by the analysis of data of a period of severe magnetic activity, August 3–10, 1972. The effect of the dense ionospheric irregularities produced by these storms on scintillation at high latitudes is viewed as a function of local time and the invariant latitude of the propagation path, as well as magnetic activity. Storm period data taken at high, middle, and equatorial latitudes are analyzed and compared with the seasonal means. In the high-latitude irregularity region, dramatic increases of scintillation index at 254 MHz were noted. Cumulative amplitude probability distribution functions are given for the high-latitude data with the aim of giving to systems designers signal statistical data for “worst case” conditions. Middle-latitude stations show little reaction to the magnetic activity. At equatorial latitudes during July and August, the longitude of the observatory determines the reaction. Accra (Ghana) data show a slight decrease in scintillations during the August storms. At Huancayo (Peru) scintillations increase in the postmidnight period."
"The field of a gaussian beam is examined in detail. It is shown that the usual formula for the field does not satisfy the wave equation within the Rayleigh distance except in the limit of large waist diameter. For small waist sizes the departure from the results of the usual formula can be substantial within a distance of about 1.3 wavelengths from the source. An exact formula is found for the on-axis radiation. In order to make this study, certain features such as the obliquity factor, which is commonly ignored, have to be considered in detail. This leads to the need for a physical characterization of the source, which is not capable of a unique specification. The choice is probably not critical — the usual formulas for the transformation of gaussian beams do not need to refer to it at all — and the one used here pertains closely to the condition of radiation from the dielectric-air interface of a solid state laser."
"A low frequency solution to the diffraction problem of an E-polarized plane wave incident on a dielectric-loaded slit in a perfectly conducting plane is obtained. The dielectric loading consists of a circular cylinder just filling the slit and concentric with the slit center. The method used is a significant improvement over the traditional pseudo-power-series method of solution. Thus, when the dielectric is absent, our values differ by less than 2.1% from the exact Mathieu function solution at ka = 2.4, a being the half width of the slit. The gap between the high and low frequency solutions has therefore been bridged. When a dielectric is present, the limit ka = 2.4 will be multiplied by $1/ \\epsilon_{1}^{1/2}$. It is found that the transmission usually increases with the dielectric constant. Some curves are given to illustrate the effects."
"The important points governing the design of a multiple-pulse measurement of the incoherent scatter autocorrelation function in the E region are discussed. Since the requirements for good signal-to-noise ratio and good resolution are contradictory, compromises must be made. These considerations dictated the choice of two multiple-pulse schemes which are now being used at the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center in Arecibo, Puerto Rico. These schemes, one involving five pulses and one involving seven, are described and a few typical examples of the results obtained are presented. The data show that it is now practical during the day, or at night in reasonably strong sporadic-E layers, to make accurate measurements of the complex autocorrelation function in the E region with an altitude resolution of the order of 1 to 3 km in a time of less than 10 min. The number of heights which can be studied simultaneously is limited only by computer capabilities. In the measurements reported here ten altitudes were sampled."

"Equations are presented which correct microwave radiometer temperature calculations for the averaging effect of the antenna pattern. Principal plane antenna patterns at 1.43, 4.0, and 7.5 GHz are used to determine the radiometer temperature of a saline water surface. The calculations, made as a function of frequency, polarization, and viewing angle, compare favorably with measured data. The results also show that excluding the measured antenna pattern from the calculations produces errors of the order of 10 or 20 K at a viewing angle of 70°. The low level (<−22 dB) cross-polarization patterns of the above antennas are found to contribute insignificant changes (<0.5 K for the scope of this paper) in the calculated results. However, for demonstrational purposes, cross-polarization patterns higher in magnitude (−16 dB) than those measured are included in the computations for comparison. The effects of water surface dielectric constant changes are also presented."
"The rms wave height of seven sec ocean waves determined by remote measurements using high frequency radar is compared with that determined by direct in-situ measurements using an accelerometer buoy. The radar-measured values vary as the buoy-measured values for various sea and wind conditions, but the radar values are systematically low with respect to the buoy values by about 2.8 db. The radar experiment is more straightforward than conventional measurements because the same receiving antenna is used to sample both the illuminating and echo fields. Radar-measured values for 〈σ0〉 for seven-sec ocean waves under homogeneous sea conditions did not exceed −29.7 db."
"Oceanic winds were measured locally by anemometers and remotely by an HF skywave radar at ranges exceeding 3000 km. Wind velocity was deduced from sea backscatter Doppler spectra. These spectra were often perturbed by ionospheric motion, yet wind direction was measured to within ±16° and wind speed to within ±4 m sec−1. Better measures of wind speed should exist at shorter ranges or with better ionospheric conditions."
"Combining time-tested techniques with modern electronic components, an inexpensive ionosonde producing high quality records and capable of unattended automatic operation for extended periods has been designed. Four instruments were built at a cost in 1967, exclusive of labor, of $2000 apiece. Three have been operated continuously for five years at a rate of one ionogram every two minutes, being attended but once a week to change the film. One of these ran 23 months with no maintenance whatsoever."
"The dependence of HF propagation parameters on the form of the electron density model used in circuit simulation calculations is investigated. It is seen that for identical values of the F2 region critical frequency and maximum height, no one of the selected models consistently reproduces observed electron density profiles better than any other. The differences in HF circuit parameters resulting from the use of different electron density models are seen to be significantly less than the uncertainty in the simulated parameters that arises from the inability to specify or predict the ionospheric structure with perfect accuracy."
"The waveforms and envelopes of resonance signals observed in the ionosphere at 2, 3, 4, and 5fH by rocket experiment are compared with the analytical results provided by a spatial ray-tracing procedure which takes the gradient of Earth's magnetic field into account. An approximate calculation yields the algebraic expression of the wave damping from whence the decrease of the received signals is deduced versus time as well as their frequency variations."
"Installation of a phased-array antenna on a UHF radar located at Homer, Alaska, makes possible a variety of data presentations for studying the radar aurora. In this paper we describe a data handling procedure that permits rather direct comparison of radar auroral developments with optical auroral displays. The procedure involves coordinate transformation of digitized radar data to produce a display resembling an all-sky-camera photograph from a selected location beneath the radar's field of view in the E layer. We present here five representative case studies of auroral developments as displayed in the radar all-sky-camera format and simultaneously recorded by means of optical all-sky cameras located in central Alaska (Fort Yukon and Chatanika)."
"A linear dipole antenna has an impedance matrix of Toeplitz form. The problem of an acoustically long cylindrical antenna in a warm plasma thus becomes numerically tractable. Both the electromagnetic and acoustic wavelengths are evident in the current distribution for acoustically long antennas. Relative accuracies of 10−11 were obtained for inversion of a 5000 × 5000 complex impedance matrix, including both electromagnetic and acoustic contributions. Antennas up to 500 acoustic wavelengths long are considered in numerical examples."
"The imperfectly conducting edges considered are those of nonmetallic, resistive and “conductive” half planes illuminated by a plane electromagnetic wave at arbitrary (oblique) incidence. By expressing the boundary conditions at the surface in terms of the normal components of the field and their normal derivatives, each problem is reduced to a combination of two scalar ones analogous to those for a plane wave incident in a plane perpendicular to the edge. From the explicit and exact solutions thus obtained, the edge diffracted fields are derived and expressed in terms of edge diffraction tensors. The tensors are relatively simple and compact. Their computation is discussed and data are presented to illustrate the behavior of the field."
"Bernstein wave interference patterns observed in an afterglow plasma are interpreted as being due only to electrostatic waves. Their effect is shown to be reduced to that of the two fields corresponding to the limit wave vectors of the undamped domain determined from the hot dispersion curves. The formulas obtained through this point of view yield the temperature of the medium and the theoretical amplitude of the field in agreement with the experimental signal envelopes."
"The principles for determining certain parameters of precipitation particles by means of a radar with two-channel orthogonal polarization capability are discussed. The parameters are or are related to the mean shape, mean orientation angle, the degree of randomness of the particle orientation, and also to particle size and phase state. The preferred orientation of such particles results in the medium being anisotropic. The propagation aspects of the problem are considered in terms of additional parameters which include the differential attenuation, the differential phase shift, and the tilt angle of the anisotropy axes. Formulas are derived for determining the parameters in terms of radar observables. A limited sample of results from 16.5 GHz data is presented in order to illustrate the radar determination of each parameter."
"During solar X-ray flares the phases of VLF and LF signals reflected from the ionosphere at grazing incidence often show an opposite behavior, the so-called phase antinomy. Two years of data have been analyzed to show the main characteristics of this phenomenon and, in particular, its seasonal dependence. An explanation of such behavior is sought in terms of changes in the phase of the ionospheric reflection coefficient. Only simple models of electron density distributions with height are numerically analyzed, namely, perturbed exponentials."
"Low frequency communication from a trapped miner is idealized as the electromagnetic boundary value problem of two-layered anisotropic earth energized by a buried vertical electric dipole. The shale beds form the anisotropic cover for the coal swamp. Using numerical integration techniques the field structure has been investigated on the air-earth interface. Analysis reveals that conductivity-anisotropy modified the electromagnetic fields quite significantly and needs to be taken into account for the precise location of the source in emergency situations."
"The traditional first Born approximation cross section for scattering of electromagnetic radiation by turbulent irregularities is generalized to include the effect of an arbitrarily modulated signal incident on the irregularities and the effect of cutting off the volume of the irregularities in the direction of propagation with an arbitrary function. This generalized cross section is proportional to a double convolution integral over the frequency spectrum of the incident signal, the spectrum of the turbulent irregularities, and the square of the Fourier transform of the function which cuts off the irregularities. Analytic and numerical results are given for the ratio of this generalized cross section to the traditional cross section for gaussian and rectangular slabs and for gaussian and rectangular pulses combined with several different turbulence spectra. The results show how the generalized cross section mixes Fresnel reflections with turbulent reflections and wideband scattering with scattering at twice the carrier frequency."
"The problem of three-dimensional scattering from anomalies buried in the earth is considered. In the general situation, this requires the fields to be evaluated using two-dimensional numerical integration. In this or the related inverse problem, subsurface characteristics are extracted from a two-dimensional grid of surface field measurements. This grid of points is computed with time-saving two-dimensional digital Fourier transforms, i.e., with plane-wave analysis. A simple method for selection of sampling windows and increments in x and k (wavenumber) space which bounds and minimizes aliasing errors is presented and used. The theory is applied to the canonical problem of magnetic dipole excitation of a buried cylinder."
"The radiation from a class of nonuniform charged particle beams of finite dimensions moving through a magnetoplasma is studied. The beam structures include bunched beams which could result from natural interaction of plasma-supported waves with the beam particles or those which could be generated by spacecraft-borne particle accelerators. The generation of narrow band noise by beam structures generated by whistler wave-beam particle interaction is illustrated. It is also shown how radiation by bunched particles remains finite in regions of refractive index resonances regardless of how slowly the particles move in contrast to the theoretical result for radiation from individual particles which unrealistically gives infinite radiated power. The theory developed includes thermal effects, including temperature anisotropy for the electrons and ions. Illustrative numerical results for the special case of a single electron with zero perpendicular velocity and a large axial velocity are given using two warm plasma theories. It is shown that near the upper hybrid resonance frequency, radiation into thermal and cold plasma modes is comparable."
"A large amplitude RF pump signal is applied to a wire antenna in a magnetic-field-free plasma. When the pump frequency ω0 corresponds to twice the sheath-plasma resonance frequency ωr, and the pump amplitude exceeds a threshold value, spontaneous excitation of the signal at ωr = ω0/2 is observed. The process is explained as a periodic variation of the sheath thickness causing the sheath-plasma resonance to become parametrically unstable. The RF field pressure can induce density relaxation oscillations near the ion plasma frequency which are observed to modulate the instability spectrum strongly."
"The modulation in backscattered power from wind-generated waves due to the presence of a 0.575-Hz plunger-generated wave has been measured in a wave tank as a function of air friction velocity and plunger wave amplitude. The measurements were made at 9.37S GHz, a depression angle of 45° and vertical polarization. The straining of the wind waves is treated by a first-order perturbation of the Boltzmann transport equation and the scattering is calculated from a simple application of composite surface scattering theory utilizing first-order Bragg scattering. The theory predicts a characteristic relaxation behavior for the wind-speed dependence of the components of the modulation amplitude in phase and out of phase with the horizontal component of orbital velocity of the plunger wave. This relaxation behavior is closely followed by the observed modulation amplitudes for air friction velocities less than about 40 cm sec−1, i.e., winds less than about 7 m sec−1."
"A method is presented for the analysis of discrete oblique ionogram traces observed in high resolution sweep-frequency sky-wave backscatter technique to obtain quasiparabolic ionospheric layer parameters. The method employs three data points on the oblique ionogram with one of the data points being the point of coincidence of the oblique ionogram trace with the leading edge of the backscatter. The method is applied to the analysis of an experimental oblique ionogram trace and the validity of the results is examined."
"The theory developed by Briggs and Parkin, given in terms of an anisotropic gaussian correlation function, is extended to a spectral description specified as a continuous function of spatial wavenumber with an intrinsic outer scale as would be expected from a turbulent medium. Two spectral forms were selected for comparison: (1) a power-law variation in wavenumber with a constant three-dimensional index equal to 4, and (2) gaussian spectral variation. The results are applied to the F-region ionosphere with an outer-scale wavenumber: (1) k0 = 2 km−1 approximately equal to the Fresnel wavenumber, and (2) k0 = 0.2 km−1. The power-law form with a small outer-scale wavenumber is consistent with recent F-region in-situ measurements, whereas the gaussian form is mathematically convenient and, hence, mostly used in the previous developments before the recent in-situ measurements. Some comparison with microwave scintillation in equatorial areas is made."
"The ionospheric absorption of a radio wave caused by small-scale irregularities with a gaussian autocorrelation function is calculated for various values of the linear scale height, the radio frequency, the scale size of the irregularities, and the mean-square fractional electron density fluctuations. The absorption is due to scattering of the radio wave into plasma oscillations by the irregularities. It is concluded that the absorption due to such irregularities with a mean-square fractional electron density deviation greater than about 10−6 exceeds the normal collisional height-integrated absorption. Absorption of this type could play a significant part in heating experiments or in an ionosphere containing naturally occurring irregularities."
"Ion effects are often observed on topside-sounder-stimulated electron plasma wave phenomena. A commonly observed effect is a spur, appearing after a time delay corresponding to the proton gyroperiod, attached to the low frequency side of an electron plasma resonance. The spurs are often observed on the resonances at the electron plasma frequency, fN, the harmonics nfH of the electron cyclotron frequency fH (n = 2, 3, 4, …), and occasionally on the upper hybrid frequency (fN2 + fH2)1/2. The spurs on the fN resonance are usually quite small unless the fN resonance overlaps with an nfH resonance; very large spurs are observed during such overlap conditions. Proton spurs are only observed on the nfH resonances when the electron plasma waves associated with these resonances are susceptible to the Harris instability and when the electromagnetic z wave can be initiated by the sounder pulse. This instability is the result of a sounder-stimulated anisotropic electron velocity distribution. The observations suggest that energy is fed into the nfH longitudinal plasma wave from the z wave by means of wave-mode coupling."
"The radiation pattern of a magnetic ring source of electromagnetic waves in an air column having a central conductor along its axis and surrounded by an annular axially magnetized plasma column is studied. This configuration gives rise to a radiation peak or peaks near, before, or beyond the critical angle depending upon the value of the magnetic field. The direction of the radiation peak depends upon the inner and outer diameters of the annular plasma column, the diameter of the central conductor, the plasma density, and the magnetic field. The direction of the radiation peak is independent of the diameter of the ring source. For very high magnetic fields the peak shifts toward the end fire direction. Based upon these results it is proposed to develop an electronically scannable narrow beam plasma antenna system."
"A characteristic surface impedance for an inhomogeneous dielectric slab that critically couples forward and backward travelling waves is computed using a generalized WKB method. The characteristic surface impedance, which is the tangential electric to magnetic field ratio at the surface of the slab, is a function of the transverse wave number. Using this expression for the characteristic surface impedance, the electric field excited by an electric line source parallel to the slab is derived. This solution is shown to be in good agreement with one derived from a rigorous analytical solution of the wave equation for the near, intermediate, and far-field regions."
"The possibility of a series expansion for the diffracted fields by a dielectric sphere or circular cylinder is considered by first expanding the Mie scattering coefficients into a geometric series (Debye expansion), and then applying a modified Watson transformation to each term of the series. The diffracted fields can then be obtained by finding poles of the Debye expansion, and evaluating the residues. The locations of the poles due to the Debye expansion as well as the Mie scattering coefficients themselves are discussed. Numerical values of the poles are tabulated. The diffracted field contributions associated with the first five terms of the Debye expansion are presented in the form of a radar scattering cross section. The geometrical optics contribution arising from each term of the Debye expansion is asymptotically evaluated. To compare the magnitude of a sum of the geometrical optics and diffracted field contributions, the radar scattering cross section of the total backscattered field, obtained from the exact Mie theory, is also plotted."
"The Doppler spectrum of electromagnetic radiation scattered by a turbulent plasma is calculated for the case in which the incident wave is a high frequency microwave or a laser beam and is not of sufficient intensity to heat the plasma. The differential scattering cross section is expressed in terms of the power spectrum of the current density fluctuations, and the wave equation and the equations of continuity and momentum for the electrons are analyzed by means of the repeated cascade theory of turbulence. The equation governing the current density spectrum in the universal equilibrium range consists of three terms: a term representing the excitation of the spectrum near the wave number of the incident wave, a term which transfers energy across the spectrum at a rate controlled by an eddy viscosity, and a molecular dissipation term. Solutions for the spectrum are obtained in the inertial and dissipation subranges which reduce to Kolmogorov and Heisenberg type spectra, respectively, in the limits of zero scattering or for wave numbers far from the wave number of the incident wave. Near the frequency ω0 of the incident wave, the differential cross sections, or equivalently Doppler spectra, for scattering at frequency a vary exponentially as —Δω−5/3 in the inertial subrange and as —Δω3 in the dissipation subrange, where Δω = ω — ω0. The characteristic frequencies controlling the Doppler half widths depend upon the scattering angle, the intensity of the incident wave, and the root-mean-square electron density fluctuation."

"This paper deals with a review of theoretical and experimental work performed in the USSR on strong fluctuations of the intensity of light."
"In this paper we consider the equations governing the second- and fourth-order coherence functions in random media. We first treat radiation propagating in a homogeneous and isotropic random medium in the limit of small wavelengths. We summarize the solutions that are available and report on some recent unpublished work. We next show how these equations may be generalized to include a nonhomogeneous background and the effects of anisotropy under acoustic conditions. The utility of the equations for considering free-space propagation is also discussed."
"This paper concerns the wave equation for an irregular time-dependent nondispersive medium contained in a slab, while a plane monochromatic primary wave passes through the latter in a perpendicular direction. The equation is reduced to an equivalent integral relation in which the influence of the medium in directions perpendicular to that of the incident wave is accounted for by an operational expression. The application of a corresponding forward-scattering approximation, the reliability of which is discussed, enables the derivation of two alternative versions for the integral equation that refers to a mainly forward-scattering medium. The second version contains as a factor the geometric optical approximation that is associated with a rectilinear propagation of the incident wave toward the point of observation. It is shown that the Neumann-Liouville series for the solution of the two mentioned versions correspond, respectively, to the well-known Born series (but including the time dependence of the slab medium) and to a series containing corrections to the above-mentioned geometric optical factor."
"In a previous paper, the characteristic functional of the wave function has been found to be the solution of a basic equation which has the same form as the original wave equation and is given in terms of the characteristic functional of the refractive index. In this paper, the theory is applied to the case of scalar wave propagation in a medium of randomly distributed particles, and the transport equation is derived by use of an analytical procedure. The renormalization of the medium and of the one-particle scattering matrix is explicitly introduced, and is found to play an essential role for energy conservation. The Fourier transform of the resulting single Green's function (in the infinite medium) has a set of poles of infinite number. The transport equation is expressed by a series of residue values at the poles of the original and complex conjugate Green's functions, and has a wider range of applicability than that of the conventional transport equation. As a method of solving the transport equation, a set of eigenfunctions is introduced, and the solution is obtained in terms of the eigenfunction series. The diffusion function associated with each eigenfunction is also obtained."
"In this paper, integral and differential equations are derived for the correlation function of a wave in a random distribution of discrete scatterers. For stationary (nonmoving) scatterers, relatively simple integral and differential equations for the correlation functions are derived from Twersky's general formulations and their relationships with the radiative transfer theory are clarified. Small-angle approximations of these differential equations are shown to be identical to the parabolic equations for the mutual coherence function in a turbulent medium. For moving scatterers, Twersky's formulation is modified to take into account the particle motion and the variation of the field in time. General integral and differential equations for spatial as well as temporal correlation function are obtained which include the effects of the constant velocity as well as the fluctuating velocity. Differential equations governing the temporal frequency spectra of the field as well as the specific intensity are derived showing the Doppler shift and the spectrum broadening."
"Although much progress has been made in the subject of propagation through random media recently, the average user of the results could be bewildered by the large number of governing parameters and conditions of validity of diverse scintillation statistics. Continuing from previous work summarizing a state of affairs of some years ago, we present some graphical representations of parameter regimes and discuss typical propagation links in nonionized media at optical and at radio wave frequencies, as well as microwave links through an ionized atmosphere. One useful graphical representation defines parameter regimes defined by a coordinate system that uses the number of mean free paths as one axis and the number of Fresnel radii as another. It is sketched for a medium defined by Kolmogorov turbulence laws in the inertial subrange."
"In this paper some general problems concerning the probability distribution of an optical signal propagated over a line-of-sight path are discussed. The basic physical models for the log-normal and Rice-Nakagami probability distributions are given, and various theoretical methods for finding the distribution are discussed, including application of the central-limit theorem, calculating moments, finding the characteristic functional, and trial and error. The not-well-known fact that the log-normal distribution is not uniquely determined by its moments is pointed out. A summary of the present theoretical and experimental work is given. In addition, some different methods of experimental analysis are suggested, including the use of hypothesis testing and goodness-of-fit tests. These methods should permit better presentation of information on probability distributions."
"The problem of measuring differential angle of arrival through two relatively small apertures of variable separation is considered. The motivation is to evaluate the practicality of a measurement program using such a quantity to observe atmospheric turbulence wavefront distortion effects when one end of the link is moving and cannot be tracked precisely. (If precise tracking were possible, then measurement of the angular resolution with a single aperture could be used to characterize the propagation path.) Theoretical results for the mean-square difference in angle of arrival are developed and numerical results are presented. Comparison of expected magnitude of effects with available measurement instrument precision indicates that the experiment should be possible, but will depend on our ability to achieve an rms single-axis angle-of-arrival measurement precision of the order of 0.1 arc sec or better."
"Numerical results are presented for the effect of the str.ength of turbulence on the temporal frequency spectrum of a focussed beam propagating in a random medium having a von Karman spectrum for the index of refraction fluctuations. We also present a new theory for the normalized covariance BI(z, r) in the intensity fluctuations of a plane wave and find that for $\\sigma_{1}^{2}\\equiv 1.23\\ k_{0}^{7/6}c_{n}^{2}z^{11/6}\\gg1$ $B_{I}(z,R)\\simeq\\exp(-11.2\\sigma_{1}^{2}R^{5/3})+(\\sigma_{1}^{2})^{-2/5}f_{3}[R/(\\sigma_{1}^{2})^{3/5}]$ where k0 is the signal wavenumber, Cn2 is the refractive index structure constant, z is the path length, R = (k0/2πz)1/2r, and f3(…) is a function given in section 3. Note that the first term is sharply peaked about R = 0 and corresponds to the rapid drop-off in B1(R) observed experimentally. The second term varies very slowly with R and corresponds to the long tail of B1(R) seen in experiments. Unlike other theories this theory is completely self-contained, and does not involve the introduction of any arbitrary cut-off parameters."
"Results of experimental investigations of fluctuations of phase front wave propagations in the turbulent atmosphere are presented. The correctness of the Kolmogorov-Obukhov spectrum has been confirmed for inhomogeneities with horizontal sizes up to dozens of kilometers, and the results have been detected dependent essentially upon duration. The latter has been explained in the limits of the hypothesis of “frozen-in” turbulence. The problem of gain losses of circular antennas was solved by using a parabolic equation for a coherent function. Inhomogeneities of a refractive index are assumed to have the Kolmogorov one-dimensional spectrum and to be anisotropic."
"We investigate in this paper the behavior of transionospheric radio signals in the presence of irregularities with a power-law spectrum. The roles played by multiple scattering and irregularity selection through the Fresnel filtering effect are delineated. The effect of competition between these two processes on the scintillation index and on the transverse correlation is discussed."
"The spatial spectrum of intensity fluctuations due to a concentrated layer of turbulence is derived from the parabolic wave equation. The spectrum of refractive index fluctuations is taken to be an unmodified power law of arbitrary strength, with exponent α, 2 < α < 6. For 2 < α < 4 it is shown that the intensity spectra for a plane wave can be expressed in terms of a single parameter U, which is the Born approximation to m2, the normalized variance of intensity fluctuation. For U ≪ 1 the Born approximation applies. The high frequency approximation to the intensity spectrum is the angular spectrum that would result from twice the strength of turbulence. It applies above the spatial frequency kf or 2π kf/U, whichever is smaller, where Kf is the frequency at the first null of the Born approximation. For U > 30, it represents essentially all of the intensity fluctuations and shows that m saturates at unity for a plane wave as U → ∞. Simple formulas for m when the source has finite angular extent show that m decreases with increasing turbulence as Uα–2 for U ≫ 1. These results are confirmed by exact calculations for the case α = 3 and by extensive observations of interplanetary scintillations."
"Spectra of intensity fluctuations resulting from the propagation of a plane wave through a thin but arbitrarily strong layer of refractive index variations are computed using the theory in a companion paper [Rumsey, 1975]. A power law spectrum with index α = 3 was assumed for the turbulence or refractive index spectrum. The intensity spectra were found to duplicate the Born approximation for weak scattering and the high frequency approximation for strong scattering. The scintillation index, or the rms intensity fluctuation, saturates at unity for a plane wave. The scintillation index has been computed for sources of various sizes. The results of the computation are in remarkable agreement with the results of radio star scintillation measurements."
"Using the method of smooth perturbations, expressions are derived for the spectra of phase and log-amplitude fluctuations for plane waves obliquely incident on layered media in which the turbulence strength varies smoothly from layer to layer. The effects of anisotropic turbulence are included."
"The effects of turbulence on the propagation of pulsed laser beams are examined. Using the Rytov theory, general expressions for the pulse fluctuations are derived in terms of arbitrary beam geometries and pulse shapes. Physical interpretations of the pulse distortion and the effects of the beam geometry on the pulse statistics are discussed."
"No abstract is available."
"Two plasma instabilities have been identified as causing small-scale irregularities in the equatorial E layer. These instabilities are referred to as the two-stream and gradient drift instabilities. Here a unified calculation is made of the saturated density amplitudes of these instabilities. The present nonlinear saturation mechanism is referred to as perturbed orbits or diffusing orbits. The density fluctuations required for this saturation are roughly 10% for the gradient drift instability and 1% for the two-stream instability. This agrees with rocket measurements over India. In addition, a calculation is made of the frequency shift of two-stream waves. This shift is a nonlinear effect due to the slowing down of electrons by the unstable waves, and could be viewed as an enhanced friction. It is shown that this frequency shift will cause the angular spectrum of the two-stream waves to be rotated upwards or downwards, depending on the direction of the electrojet. Such rotations have been observed by radar."
"Turbulence in the equatorial electrojet is attributed to the nonlinear evolution of the gradient drift instability. Solutions are given for a set of nonlinear coupled differential equations for the amplitudes of a two-dimensional Fourier series representing the density fluctuations. The differential equations are derived from the electron and ion fluid equations by retaining the divergence of electron flux as the only nonlinearity. The results pertain to daytime conditions when dissociative recombination is the dominant linear wave damping mechanism. The irregularities reach amplitudes of ∼ 10% and are found to break up into smaller dominant scale sizes in the horizontal westward direction than in the vertical direction. A steepening of the density waveform appears in the vertical direction. Perturbed electron velocities form vortex patterns and reach magnitudes comparable to the mean electrojet drift speed."
"A computer/simulation based on fluid equations of motion seems to account for basic observational features of short wavelength type 2 (subsonically propagating) ionization irregularities in the equatorial electrojet. The short wavelengths (less than 28 m for parameters taken here) are excited only after long wavelength, horizontally propagating waves grow to an amplitude sufficient to trigger the nonlinear growth of secondary vertically propagating modes. The result is a complicated two-dimensional turbulent flow, with convective elements moving with comparable vertical and horizontal velocities. The density fluctuation power spectrum obeys approximately a power law k−35. These results agree with theory and observation."
"Electron density profiles from nine daytime rocket flights at Wallops Island, Va., conducted by the University of Illinois at high and low levels of solar activity, are compared with profiles calculated by inversion of ionograms obtained at the same times and location. Sources of error and uncertainty in the ionogram inversion are discussed, as are means for their amelioration. In most cases, agreement between the two kinds of measurement within a few percent in electron density and within a few percent of a scale height can be achieved."
"An investigation of the horizontal structure of sporadic-£ layers has been made using the incoherent scatter radar at the Arecibo Observatory. Data are presented for two observations, one with the radar beam held in a vertical position, and another with the beam scanning in azimuth across the sporadic-E layer. The first observation was made at sunset and shows the passage of a large region of ionization, about 150 km in extent, having little small-scale horizontal structure. The second, at midday, shows considerable-variation in the value of the maximum electron density in the vertical cross section of an intense sporadic-E layer. The horizontal dimensions of the features range in size down to the resolution of the radar (300 m). By considering the data statistically it is shown that small patches, 300 m or less in horizontal extent, exist in the sporadic-E layer with densities great enough to account for the maximum frequency of the echo recorded on the ionosonde located at the observatory."
"Simultaneous Chatanika incoherent scatter radar, auroral all-sky camera, and photometric data are utilized to delineate the structure and dynamics of the auroral E layer for various types of disturbances. The vertical distribution of ionization (Ne(h) profiles) is presented and discussed for various disturbance phenomena, such as the great geomagnetic storm of August 2–9, 1972, intense auroral particle precipitation events (March 16, 1972, March 2, 1973), and auroral infrasonic wave disturbances, April 2, 1973. Ne(h) profiles for quiet conditions and for a slowly varying disturbance (the July 10, 1972, solar eclipse) are shown for comparison purposes."
"Electron temperatures and electron densities measured on four rocket flights have been used to deduce electron heating rates in the E and lower F regions. Above 150 km heating rates at midday are found to be in good agreement with calculated values. Anomalies are found in the heating rates at sunrise which are attributed to a source, such as joule heating, which does not produce ionization."
"Photometers carried aboard an Aerobee rocket mapped the ultraviolet night sky at White Sands, New Mexico. Maps for five 300 Å passbands in the wavelength range 170 to 1400 Å reveal spatial radiation patterns unique to each spectral subregion. The major ultraviolet features seen in these maps are ascribed to a variety of sources: 1) solar Lyman a (1216 Å) and Lyman β (1026 Å), resonantly scattered by geocoronal hydrogen; 2) solar Hell (304 A) resonantly scattered by ionized helium in the Earth's plasmasphere; 3) solar Hel (384 Å) resonantly scattered by neutral helium in the interstellar wind and Doppler shifted so that it penetrates the Earth's helium blanket; and 4) starlight in the 912 to 1400 Å band, primarily from early-type stars in the Orion region. Not explained are the presence of small, but measurable, albedo signals observed near the peak of flight. Intensities vary from several kilorayleighs for Lyman α to a few rayleighs for HeII."
"Measured electron density and [NO+]/[O2+] data are used to deduce the seasonal and solar activity variation of E-region nitric oxide concentration. The results imply a strong dependence of [NO] on soft X rays leading to the possibility that dissociation of N2 by energetic photoelectrons is a major source of N(2D). Seasonal variations of the thermosphere apparently cause enhanced [NO] in summer in agreement with the summer enhancement of experimental [NO+]/[O2+]."
"Midlatitude sunrise electron density profiles have been analyzed in order to determine nitric oxide concentrations in the range 100–160 km. In general, the determinations are restricted to heights for which the ionization of nitric oxide by direct solar Lyman-α radiation is the main contribution to the growth of the E region. The concentrations obtained are larger, by factors of approximately 3 to 4, than those obtained from the midlatitude airglow measurements of other workers. Concentrations have been obtained from one sunset measurement and these are significantly lower than the sunrise values. The results also give a clear indication of increasing nitric oxide concentrations above 120 km with increasing solar activity."
"Incoherent scatter results are presented using compressed-pulse techniques to study a sporadic-E layer at Arecibo. Multiple Barker-coded pulses were used to obtain the autocorrelation function of the Es layer. A 13-bit code with a baud length of 4 μsec was employed, resulting in 600-m height resolution. The observations are examined for the presence of Fe+ by least-square fitting the measured autocorrelation functions to a library of theoretical ones. The analysis indicates that Fe+ dominates in the Es layer, usually providing about 70% of the ionization."
"Silicon ions are normally detected at altitudes above 100 km and within sporadic-E layers. Traces have rarely been observed within the more permanent metallic layer near 93 km. This is surprising since silicon is an important constituent of chondritic meteorites, which ablate material in this region to provide a primary source of the metallic species observed there. In this work, we present evidence that Si+ ions form SiO2+ at the lower altitudes, and exist in this ionic state prior to recombination. A rocket launched from El Arenosillo, Spain, on 3 July 1972, at 0743 LMT (χ = 57.1°), during the predicted period of the [3 Taurids meteor shower, passed through a continuous belt of metallic ions that began near 85 km, ended near 115 km, and exhibited an order of magnitude increase in the form of a layer near 114 km. Si+ was measured in and below the ledge down to 103 km. It showed a rapid decrease below this height. A comparison of the isotopic ratio for nickel, [60Ni]/[58Ni], with the measured ions shows too large a ratio for the ions below 100 km, suggesting contribution to 60+ from other sources. A prime candidate is SiO2 +, since Si+ is observed to decrease in the region where the ratio becomes too large. No evidence for SiO+ (44+) is present in the data, indicating that Si+ forms SiO2+ either directly or through SiO+ in a short-lived state. Radiative association is offered as a primary mechanism for SiO2+ production and yields a calculated reaction rate of 2 × 10−16 cm3 sec−l."
"Two sets of rocket measurements of nighttime E-region electron densities at Wallops Island are analyzed. One is a series of five electron density profiles that were taken during the night of February 22, 1968, and the other is a collection of electron density profiles that were taken near midnight under varying conditions of geomagnetic activity. The method of analysis uses the steady-state continuity equation for electrons and gives information on the height-averaged ionization production rate and the vertical profile of the ion drift. Conclusions drawn from this analysis include the following: The more marked intermediate layer observed under geomagnetically quiet conditions is most likely a straightforward consequence of lesser ionization rates. Small values of vertical ion drift (about 10 m sec−1) are sufficient to give rise to a marked intermediate layer. Electron production in the E region is minimum near midnight. The production rate below 130 km (probably HI Lβ) increases sharply between 0130 and 0300 EST whereas the production rate in the region above remains relatively constant. The ionization rate in the nighttime E region varies strongly with Kp, suggesting the importance of energetic electrons even under moderate and quiet conditions. The intermediate layer may be a result of electron redistribution by the tidal winds of the (2,4) mode of the solar semidiurnal tide."
"Measurements of the neutral temperature in the altitude region 100 to 130 km during the past several years at Millstone Hill (42°N) and St. Santin (45°N) have revealed that, on the average, there exist strong semidiurnal tidal effects which can be identified with the (2,4) tidal mode propagating from the stratomesosphere. The average amplitude of the temperature oscillation reaches a maximum of about 35 K at 116 km with maxima at 0630 and 1830 hr LT. At each station, large variability is found in amplitude and phase from one observing period to another, particularly during winter. From classical tidal theory, the average temperature behavior implies a semidiurnal zonal wind oscillation with an amplitude of about 45 m sec−1 at 110 km having eastward maxima at about 0500 and 1700 hr LT, and a meridional component with similar amplitude having southward maxima at 0800 and 2000 hr LT. The downward phase velocity is about 4 km hr−1. These results are in good agreement with direct wind measurements at St. Santin, and with some recently reported characteristics of the height variations of sporadic-E at midlatitudes. At Arecibo (18°N), semidiurnal oscillations have also been found to dominate the E-region temperature and wind structure with similar amplitude and phase velocities as above; however, the observed phase behavior is more variable than at midlatitudes and the average results do not allow reliable mode identification. Some results of recent simultaneous observations at low and midlatitudes are presented which imply that during any particular observing period, the E-region structure must be controlled by local effects."
"Incoherent scatter measurements using multiple-pulse techniques were performed at Arecibo to study the E region with a height resolution of 2.4 km. These simultaneous measurements of ion temperature, ion-neutral collision frequency, and electron density, as well as horizontal and vertical components of ion drift velocity, have allowed comparison between theories of sporadic-E and experiment. Sporadic-E layers were consistently observed to descend along the curve where the vertical ion drift velocity (Vz) was zero and its gradient ∂ Vz/∂dz was negative, as predicted by redistribution theory. Assuming no diffusion, the calculated effective recombination coefficient at the layer peak is more than an order of magnitude too small for NO+ or O2+, and varies with height in a manner which is unacceptable for a recombination coefficient. This indicates that the layer is composed of long-lived ions (probably metallic), and that the peak layer density is controlled by diffusion rather than recombination. By ignoring recombination, the diffusion coefficient was estimated from the layer thickness and the vertical gradient in the vertical ion velocity. The results were compared with independent values calculated from the measurements of ion temperature and ion-neutral collision frequency. The two estimates were in good agreement over the range 110 to 120 km, showing that electron densities in sporadic-E layers are primarily determined by molecular diffusion."
"An all-sky, continuous wave radio meteor wind facility has been installed in Atlanta by the Georgia Institute of Technology under National Science Foundation sponsorship. A double sideband suppressed carrier CW transmitter, operating on 32.5 MHz ± 360 Hz, with an rms output of 2 kw, has been installed on the Georgia Tech campus, and a receiving site established at Technology Park/Atlanta, 27 km northeast of the campus. Details of the equipment, together with height/time profiles of mean wind circulation and tides between 80 and 100 km, measured from August 9 to September 4, 1974, are presented."
"A one-dimensional time-dependent model of the ionosphere has been developed and applied to the study of a metallic ion sporadic-E layer observed in the Aladdin 1 experiment carried out at Eglin AFB, Florida, 20 November 1970. The model develops the molecular ion background ionosphere using a dynamic photochemical calculation from noon to a time near model sunset. A representative metallic ion altitude profile is then introduced, the divergence terms included in the continuity equations, and the integration carried forward. Introducing an ad hoc constant electric field of 2 mv m−1 directed to the south, the model metallic ion sporadic-E layer forms at the proper altitude and reaches the measured peak density in about a half hour. Changing the initial metallic ion profile changes the time to reach peak density and the degree of asymmetry of the layer, but the layer altitude is determined asymptotically by the location of the convergent node of the vertical ion velocity profile. The background ionospheric density calculated with the model agrees within experimental error with the experimental profile. The calculations support the hypothesis that midlatitude sporadic-E layers are caused by neutral-wind-induced compression of metallic ions resulting from meteoric ablation in the lower E region."
"An estimate of the global-scale joule heating rates in the thermosphere is made based on derived globed equivalent overhead electric current systems in the dynamo region during geomagnetically quiet and disturbed periods. The total neutral gas heating rate due to joule dissipation is proportional to the Pedersen conductivity and the square of the total electric field perpendicular to the geomagnetic field line. The equivalent total electric field distribution is calculated from Ohm's law as applied to the dynamo region using the equivalent overhead currents estimated from geomagnetic data and the components of the two-dimensional conductivity tensor determined from global empirical models of the electron and neutral gas number density distributions. The global-scale joule heating rates are calculated for various monthly average periods in 1965. The calculated joule heating rates maximize at high latitudes in the early evening and postmidnight sectors. During geomagnetically quiet times the daytime joule heating rates are considerably lower than heating by solar EUV radiation. However, during geomagnetically disturbed periods the estimated joule heating rates increase by an order of magnitude and can locally exceed the solar EUV heating rates. The results show that joule heating is an important and at times the dominant energy source at high latitudes. However, the global mean joule heating rates calculated near solar minimum are generally small compared to the global mean solar EUV heating rates."
"Dipole electric field, positive ion and electron densities and temperatures, vehicle potential, and plasma sheath measurements have been made in the auroral E region by means of rockets flown from Fort Churchill, Canada. These results are described and compared over the altitude region 100 to 165 km. On a rocket flight launched on 10 December 1969 during very quiet conditions, adjacent to a stable, low intensity auroral arc, the plasma density and temperatures are found to be high and the electric fields large and steady. Electric field components of the order of −17 mv m−1 to +6 mv m−l were measured along the Earth's magnetic field. The plasma results indicate that these fields may be contributing to enhanced electron temperatures. On a flight of 9 March 1970 during a large magnetic storm with widespread auroral activity, lower plasma densities and temperatures and much smaller and more erratic electric fields were observed with no significant component parallel to the magnetic field."
"The topic of instabilities and irregularities is a comparatively recent field, in which a great deal of insight has been developed through interdisciplinary contacts between ionospheric and plasma physicists. Historically, the landmark year for the opening of the field was 1963, which saw the independent development by Farley [1963] and Bunemann [1963] of the theory of the two-stream instability (now generally accepted as the cause of the Type I electrojet irregularities), and the development by Simon [1963] and Hoh [1963], in a laboratory-plasma context, of what is now variously known as the gradient-drift, crossfield, or E × B instability (which is becoming accepted as the source of Type II irregularities). In all fairness, however, it is worth remembering that Martyn [1959] had earlier published a qualitative description of the gradient-drift instability and its possible application to ionospheric spread-F."
"There are three major topics which arose in Session 2 on which I would like to comment, namely, maintenance of the night ionosphere, particle ionization, and modelling."
"When one begins to summarize the conference proceedings dealing with the neutral and ion chemistry of the E region, one becomes forcefully aware of the spectacular advances that have been made in this area during the past decade. This conference has well demonstrated that these advances are continuing, and that there is yet a wide range of problems to be overcome. Both these aspects will be discussed briefly below."
"Meteorologists used to criticize those who described themselves as aeronomers or ionospheric physicists, pointing out their neglect of neutral air motions in calculating ionospheric behavior. This situation has changed dramatically in the last few years. At this meeting, the effects of neutral air motions were considered either implicitly or explicitly in over one third of the papers presented. Some of the topics that explicitly touched on neutral atmosphere dynamics are described in the following paragraphs."
"These two sessions, which cover the topics of E-region models, electric fields, and electric currents, underscore a major difficulty necessarily encountered in studies of the E region. This difficulty arises from the fact that the E region of the ionosphere is just one part of a very large system, all of whose component parts are strongly coupled electrodynamically and hydrodynamically. Before describing a general approach to overcome this difficulty, let me briefly discuss some of the important coupling processes in the overall system."

"A model is developed for the substrate current of an IGET operating in saturation. This current results from the impact ionization of the channel current carriers in the high field region adjacent to the drain. Due to the exponential dependency of the impact ionization process on the electric field, an accurate description of the field near the drain is essential. An expression for the field, accounting for the two-dimensional nature of the drain space charge region, is used. The result is a closed form expression for the substrate current. By using an appropriate p-n junction model for the source diffusion, the floating substrate potential in SOS devices is evaluated."
"Uniform minimum acceptable requirements for the performance of reliability analyses for safety-related systems found in nuclear power generating stations are provided. The requirements can be applied during design, fabrication, testing, maintenance, and repair of systems and components in nuclear power plants. The timing of the analysis depends upon the purpose for which it is performed."
"A list of graphic symbols and class designation letters for use on electrical and electronics diagrams is provided. All of the symbols are designed so that their connection points fall on a modular grid, to help those who use a grid basis for the preparation of diagrams. A substantial effort has been made to make this standard compatible with approved International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Recommendations (IEC Publication 117, in various parts)."
