"The problem of rain static, particularly as it affects aircraft, is treated. Rain static is due to particles of rain, snow, or dust striking aircraft antennas. It has been found that the disturbance is electrostatic in origin and that an electrostatically shielded loop antenna reduces it materially."
"Experiments are described in which \"parasitic\" oscillations are elicited, and suppressed, in a generator of the Barkhausen-Kurz type by means of either voltage or circuit adjustments. The performance of tubes of new design employing a straight filament, helical grid, and cylindrical plate cut transversely into three sections is described, and the bearing of the experimental results on the problem of the modes of oscillation of the resonating grid oscillator is indicated. A method of stabilizing frequency by the use of such tubes in conjunction with a tuned transmission line is given."
"Mercurypool tubes of the ignitron type offer attractive features for power rectifier service. This paper discusses the application of this type to controlled high voltage, high power rectifiers for radio transmitters, and some problems peculiar to their use as such. A developmental rectifier of this type, which has been in trial operation, is described."
"Class B audio-frequency and radio-frequency amplifiers have many applications and the distortion can be kept to a very low value if the necessary precautions are taken to prevent nonlinearity of such amplifiers. Undoubtedly, the most important factor in the design of a class B amplifier for low distortion is the characteristic of the driver system. Tube characteristics and the use of a proper load are also important but are more definite and more generally understood. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of recent developments of the class B audio and radio amplifiers to reduce distortion. The results of the investigations indicate that a heavily loaded driver system in general is undesirable because of the power consumed and because such loading results in greater distortion than obtainable by other means. The general procedure adopted to reduce distortion was to prevent distortion in each unit of the amplifier system. Distortion balancing schemes are not only critical to adjust but are likely to introduce higher order harmonics and sum and difference tones which may be more objectionable than a higher measured value of lower order harmonics. Actual performance data are presented for medium and relatively high powered audio and radio systems. The necessary input requirements to permit the performance obtained are discussed. Sufficient theory is given to make the paper complete and to show that the actual performance of such amplifiers can be quite accurately predicted if the necessary tube characteristics are known."
"This paper presents a simplified method of driving a power tube without the need of coupling devices and grid-biasing means. The power section is one whose useful plate-current versus grid-voltage characteristic is realized only with positive values of grid voltage. Its low input impedance is in series with the cathode-ground circuit of the driver tube. This impedance, also, automatically provides a negative bias for the grid of the driver, thereby eliminating external biasing. Since the electronic coupling of the two tubes varies with signal excursions, this method of amplification is termed \"dynamic coupling.\" Practical considerations show immediately that the driver must operate into an impedance which is considerably lower than its own plate impedance. It is shown that the distortion which is produced when working with such ratios is minimized partly by making the driver circuit degenerative in order to nullify the varying effect of the driver's mu. This is treated first with a pure resistive load. When the grid impedance is the load, a further reduction in distortion is shown, for then the ratio of plate-to-load impedance remains more nearly constant throughout a signal excursion. The remaining part of the paper deals with a commercial application of these principles. Certain design considerations for a tube embodying both driver and power sections are discussed. A current surge phenomenon caused by secondary emission is discussed and a practical means for its elimination is given. The delayed point at which the driver's grid begins drawing current is shown to be particularly advantageous."
"Virtual height and critical frequency measurements of the several regions of the ionosphere were made during the day of the solar eclipse of February 3, 1935, and during several days before and after the eclipse day. The eclipse was found to produce a decrease of the critical frequency of each region. The decrease of critical frequency was approximately in time phase with the eclipse, thus indicating an ionizing agency (probably ultraviolet light), originating in the sun and propagated at approximately the velocity of light. The decrease of equivalent electron density in each region during the eclipse was compared with the decrease of the exposed area of sun's disk, and found to indicate that the ionization of the normal E region was diminished when the ionizing agency was decreased, by recombination of plus and minus charges, while the ionization of the F2region and a high stratum of the E was diminished by a process of attachment of electrons to neutral particles."
"The dynatronic and magnedynatronic systems commonly used to obtain a negative resistance by means of triodes or tetrodes are characterized by the fact that the potential of the active electrode (the anode) is not the highest potential in the system; an electrode (the grid or the screen grid) at a higher potential is necessary in order to take off the secondary emission current from the anode in such a way that a falling characteristic is produced in the anode circuit. The present paper deals with a three-electrode tube of such design that the negative resistance is obtained in the circuit of the electrode possessing the highest potential in the system."

"With its novel directional antenna, WOR produces a maximum field strength toward both New York and Philadelphia while limiting radiation in the direction of the ocean and sparsely populated areas. Radiation distribution measurements are given. The layout of the station and the unique arrangements for lighting, heating, and ventilation of the building are described. A serious attempt has been made to design and operate the equipment for a performance consistent with advanced ideas of high fidelity. Measurements from microphone to antenna of distortion, noise, and frequency response are presented."
"Propagation between these two buildings at a frequency of 177 megacycles has been studied with the object of providing a radio circuit with flat response over three megacycles. It was found that the received signal arrived over several paths, some of which were due to reflections from ground and from near-by buildings. The effects on the indirect rays of horizontal and vertical directivity, and change in angle of polarization were observed. The theoretical response curve for an assumed combination of rays was compared with the curves obtained experimentally."
"The electron beam of a cathode-ray tube is usually focused by means of an electron optical system of two coaxial cylinders. This paper presents a detailed treatment of such a focusing system and is divided into two parts. Geometric electron optics of axially symmetric electrostatic fields is presented in Part I. This part deals with (1) the analogy between light and electron optics, (2) motion of electrons in axially symmetric electrostatic fields, (3) definition and determination of positions of cardinal points due to axially symmetric electrostatic fields, and (4) thick and thin lenses. The lenses equivalent to the electrostatic fields of two coaxial cylinders are discussed in Part II. This part deals with (1) positions of cardinal points due to two coaxial cylinders of various diameters and at various voltages, (2) use of such cardinal points, (3) experimental determination of positions of cardinal points, and (4) spherical aberration of electrostatic field due to two cylinders. The results are applied to the cathode-ray tube, throughout the discussion."
"The need for vacuum tube generators capable of delivering appreciable power at frequencies from 300 to 600 megacycles is pointed out and the negative resistance magnetron is suggested as one of the more promising generators for this purpose. An explanation of the negative resistance characteristic in a split-anode magnetron is given by means of a special tube which makes possible the visual study of electron paths. In this manner it is demonstrated how most of the electrons starting toward the higher potential plate reach the lower potential plate. From the static characteristics it is shown how the output, efficiency, and load resistance can be calculated, and from this analysis it is concluded that the negative resistance magnetron is essentially a high efficiency device at low frequencies. Measurements of efficiency at ultra-high frequencies are given for several magnetrons under various operating conditions. It is concluded from these measurements that the decrease of efficiency at very high frequencies is mainly due to electron-transit-time effects. A general curve is given showing efficiency as a function of the \"transit-time ratio.\" This curve indicates that for a transit time of one-fifteenth of a period, approximately fifty per cent efficiency is possible; for one-tenth of a period, thirty per cent; and for one-fifth of a period, the efficiency is essentially zero. Two methods are described for increasing the plate-dissipation limit. One method is that of increasing the effective heat-dissipating area by the use of an internal circuit of heavy conductors."

"This paper introduces a new form of linear power amplifier for modulated radio-frequency waves. Plate circuit efficiencies of sixty to sixty-five per cent independent of modulation are obtained by means of the combined action of varying load distribution among the tubes and varying circuit impedance over the modulation cycle. The theory of operation is developed and detailed observations on the behavior of tubes in the new circuit are given in the paper. The use of stabilized feedback in connection with this circuit is discussed and significant measurements on a laboratory model of a fifty-kilowatt transmitter are shown."
"The general problems and limitations encountered in two-way police communication are discussed. A receiver circuit especially adapted to the adverse conditions imposed upon this class of equipment is described in detail and performance curves are shown. Several transmitters are described and their salient features pointed out. A new type of ultra-high frequency antenna system is described and its general theory of operation explained."
"In this paper the measurement of power and voltage at ultra-short waves is considered. A signal generator delivering adequate power output with satisfactory stability over the wave-length range from twenty to 200 centimeters is described. The requirements of thermocouples satisfactory for the measurement of power are considered and a set of thermocouples covering the power range from 0.1 milliwatt to fifty watts is described. A study of vacuum tube voltmeters has shown that diode voltmeters have very small loading (of the order of 105ohms) on the circuits to which they are connected, whereas conventional triode voltmeters using RCA-955's have an input impedance of about 104ohms at a wave length of one meter. The errors of diode voltmeters at ultra-short wave lengths have been studied and found to be of two kinds: 1. An error due to partial series resonance between the lead inductances and the interelectrode capacity. 2. An error due to a transit time effect. This has been called \"premature cutoff.\" These errors have been studied experimentally and theoretically, the results being in qualitative agreement. In the course of the experimental work very small diodes have been built, the smallest diode having an anode diameter of only 0.0065 inch. Calibrations for these diode voltmeters have been obtained."
"It is demonstrated that the frequency response curve of a resistance coupled amplifier is identical to that of an idealized tuned amplifier. Certain theoretical limitations on the stage gain and the band of frequencies amplified are derived, and the practical limitations are estimated. The use of a pliodynatron as a resistance coupled amplifier in order to overcome certain of the limitations is suggested. Curves and formulas are presented which will aid in the design of amplifiers by Luck's method. Analogous formulas for tuned amplifiers are derived."

"Permanent magnet materials recently have been developed with characteristics radically different from those of previous materials, the carbon, cobalt, and chromium steels. In this paper, the essential properties of these new materials are discussed and are compared with the corresponding properties of the older materials. Development of these new materials has broadened the range of properties from which the designer may choose, and has made available high specific magnetic performance in the low price field."
"Temperature distribution and heat flow in electrical conductors have been subjected to a mathematical analysis, which brings out a number of interesting thermal characteristics of conductors. The material presented in this paper is divided into 2 principal parts, the first being a general solution of the problem of determining temperature and heat distribution in conductors, and the second containing the development of the theory of the electrothermic ammeter of the thermocouple type, together with its compensation features. Practical applications of the theory are presented."

"The application of supervisory control equipment and electric pump drive to municipal waterworks systems results not only in greatly improved operation, but also in a reduction in operating costs. Existing waterworks systems may be modernized and many improvements secured by the application of various types of electrical equipment. As an illustration of the benefits which may be obtained, a description is given of the modernization of the waterworks system of the city of Pittsburg, where electric operation of pumps, together with supervisory control, remote metering, and remote indication, are now used."
"Power dispatching on an interconnected electric power system has been simplified and greatly improved by the adoption of a remote metering and automatic load control scheme recently developed. Remote metering at the power dispatching center provides continuous indication of the load on a distant 110-kv interconnection. The equipment also provides automatic control of the load on a hydroelectric generating plant located 160 miles from the metering point. The scheme, operating over company owned telephone lines, is based upon maintaining a constant beat frequency in the receiving apparatus, the transmission frequency being varied. Maintenance cost of the equipment is found to be negligible."
"With the object of determining the effectiveness of the newer methods of protecting distribution transformers from lightning, a survey of operating data obtained during 1934 by 38 electric power companies has been made by the transmission and distribution committee of the Edison Electric Institute. The results of this survey are presented herewith. In general, interconnection of the lightning arrester ground with the secondary neutral has been found superior to other methods of protection."
"As part of the modernization symposium scheduled for the 1936 winter convention, the A.I.E.E. transformer and lightning arrester subcommittees* have prepared this joint report, which summarizes briefly methods now available for protecting transformers against both traveling waves and direct strokes."
"Relay systems used for the protection of power transmission networks are now available which are greatly superior to those in use some 5 years ago. The principal change has been the development of the high speed relay, the operating time of which may be as low as one cycle or less on a 60 cycle system. Modernization of existing relay systems frequently may be accomplished by the addition of the new relays to the present relay scheme, thereby avoiding the cost of an entirely new relay system. High speed relays, especially when used with high speed circuit breakers, result in reduction of damage at stations and on lines, and give improved system stability and operation; reduction of outages on equipment of industrial customers has been an important advantage. This paper on modernization of relay systems is presented under the sponsorship of the relay subcommittee of the A.I.E.E. committee on protective devices."
"Analyses of field measurements of lightning disturbances and of operating experience on a metropolitan electric power distribution system have yielded valuable information on protective methods. Performance records of transformers, fuses, lightning arresters, meters, and customers equipment with the interconnection method of protection (arrester ground and secondary neutral interconnected) are analyzed. Experience with protective methods for underground cables and for stud type of distribution transformers is cited, and an a-c method of testing arresters is described."
"Supervisory control and remote metering installations on the electrified section of the Pennsylvania Railroad are outlined herein. A brief history of the growth of electrification on this railroad, and of the supervisory control and remote metering installations which accompanied the electrification is given, together with the locations at which the different types of equipment are used. These remote metering and control systems have been of considerable assistance in load dispatching and substation operation."
"Engineering and practice in electric power distribution systems have kept pace with modern developments in other lines. Many improvements in system design and in details of equipment and construction have been produced in recent years which make for economy, better service, greater safety, and better appearance. The most important of these are discussed with indications of future trends."
"Early applications of lightning arresters were hindered not only by high cost, but also by the general lack of knowledge of both the characteristics of lightning and the protective characteristics of the arresters themselves. Present knowledge of these factors, however, achieved as a result of extensive field and laboratory research, has made possible the production of arresters having greatly improved characteristics and at much lower costs, which has led to their extensive use for protecting transformers and other equipment. This paper presents a brief review of the history of lightning arresters, and discusses factors affecting their economic application to electric power systems."
"Experiments with oxidized and oxide-Free materials indicate that the electrical characteristics of the ordinary sliding contact, such as that between a carbon or graphite brush and a copper slip ring, are dependent upon the oxide film on the surface of the ring. Results of these experiments are presented in this paper, together with an explanation of the breakdown of this oxide film by the increase of current through the contact, based upon these results. Tests to determine the effects of liquid films on the contact voltage drop, and the variation of thermal voltage in a sliding contact also are reported."
"Automatic control for steel-tank mercury-arc rectifiers may be considered under 2 main divisions, one being control for switching equipment, and the other being control of the unit auxiliaries such as tank heaters, anode heaters, vacuum control and protective equipment, arc ignition and excitation, cooling tank, and circulating pump. A review of present day practice in automatic control for mercury arc rectifiers is presented herewith."
"Although the characteristics of ultra-high frequency radio communication between fixed points have been established Fairly well, the utilization of these frequencies in communication between front and rear of moving railway trains presented problems of which little was known. This paper reports the results of extensive tests made to determine the practical value of these frequencies for such service, and describes commercial equipment susequently developed."

"In connection with recent developments of new types of underground cables for high voltages, questions have been raised concerning the stability in service of impregnated paper insulation of the ordinary type. In addition to giving new data on the only reliable test method found for predetermining this stability-accelerated aging tests-this paper gives information on the mechanism of failure, and on the effects of variations in construction and materials. Long service life was indicated by the tests for good insulation of the ordinary type."
"Development of automatic voltage regulating equipment for installation on 4 kv distribution circuits at points remote from the substation has made possible a reduction in the cost of distribution by loading circuits to their economic carrying capacities unhampered by the limitation of voltage regulation. Investigation indicates 2 rules governing the application of booster regulators, and comparisons on the basis of cost per unit of voltage improvement shows which of the several devices available should be selected to secure the lowest cost. Tests have demonstrated the practicability of this form of regulation, and its field of application is indicated by economic comparisons with other methods of maintaining voltage within the required limits."
"Fuses made of copper that have been used as additional protection for transformers in low voltage networks in the event that the network protector should fail to operate may blow too quickly on brief overloads, and fail to blow on long-sustained overloads of lesser magnitude. By the combination of a fusible alloy of low melting point and copper blocks that delay the rate of temperature rise the fuse described in this paper provides a time-current characteristic which more nearly approaches the ideal."
"Obviously it is impossible to prophesy accurately what will happen in any phase of human activity. In the field of lighting, however, it is fairly safe to make some predictions based upon the following hypothesis: Throughout the world there are certain organizations and establishments which are unusually progressive, which do things before the ideas involved have been accepted generally. A study, therefore, of what is being done in these outstanding examples gives an indication of what is likely to become general practice in the next several years. On this basis the author analyzes lighting methods in certain definite fields, such as stores, restaurants, industrial plants, and streets. He describes installations of new types of illuminants and new methods of applying the older forms."
"A review of progress in illumination during the past 4 years has been prepared by the AIEE committee on production and application of light,* and is presented here. This report deals primarily with new types and forms of light sources and improvements in old ones. Some examples of modern applications of these new light sources are discussed in 2 other papers in this issue: ``Today's Trends in Lighting,'' pages 1100-10; and ``Electrical Features of the Texas Centennial Central Exposition,'' pages 1060-74."
"This paper describes an application of carrier-current relaying combined with rapid reclosure of circuit breakers by means of which the continuity of service to a large industrial load supplied by a long single-circuit line was improved. A 110-kv line 120 miles long, forming part of an interconnected loop, has been equipped in this way to clear faults and restore service in approximately one second. The effect of the connected motor load on circuit interruption is also discussed."

The control equipment is practically inertialess and, therefore, is almost instantaneous in its operation. The circuit may be compounded to have a wide variety of characteristics."
"Characteristics of polyphase induction motors are analyzed in this paper by the method of symmetrical components in a manner different from other recently published articles. The analysis is neither tedious nor highly involved and curves of motor characteristics obtained by tests under unbalanced conditions agree closely with curves obtained by calculation."
"The application of tensor algebra to the solution of multiwinding transformer circuits is discussed in this paper for comparison with the methods more commonly used for the solution of such circuits. By means of the applications to transformer circuits given herein, elementary tensor methods are illustrated."
"Conversations with foreign delegates to the Third World Power Conference held in Washington, DC, USA during the early part of September, prompted Editor L.W.W. Morrow (A'13, F'25, director) of \"Electrical World\" to write the accompanying editorial, which is reprinted by permission from the 26 September 1936, issue of that publication."
"The method of tensors, as applied to the analysis of electrical systems, has gained favor because of its versatility. The most common application of the method in electrical engineering is the analysis of the dynamics of rotating machinery, but a further application is presented in this paper.

"The new conditions of life brought about by the material advances of recent times, which have been achieved primarily as a result of the work of scientists and engineers, have brought with them new and pressing problems, social, economic, political, and international. In this address,* Doctor Durand states that ``we (engineers) cannot evade the responsibility which rests upon us to take our due share, even the lead, in the study of the problems which our own activities have, in a large measure, developed.'' He urges ``a quickened sense on the part of the engineer, of his responsibilities, not alone in a purely professional sense, but as a citizen of his community, of his state, of his country, of the world.''"
"Further investigation of the lightning performance of the circuit formerly known as the Wallenpaupack-Siegfried line is reported in this paper, which presents measurements of structure currents as made by surge-crest ammeters and additional data on the effect of counterpoises and ground wires."
"Cathode-ray oscillographs, a few years ago found only in research laboratories, have become extremely useful tools in the hands of operating engineers, research technicians, and teachers alike; however the usefulness of cathode-ray oscillographs of the ordinary portable type is limited almost entirely to the observation of sustained periodic phenomena, and is of little use in the study of transients. Methods of extending the field of application of this instrument to include visual observation of circuit and line transients are presented in this paper."
"Formulas for practical use in the calculation of the resistances from grounding conductors of variou forms to the earth are given in this paper and their use illustrated by examples. The accuracy of the formulas varies considerably, as discussed in the paper, but is sufficiently good that the methods should be helpful to those whose work involves problems of grounding."
"Predetermination of the a-c characteristics of dielectrics by d-c measurements was discussed in an earlier paper.1 The present paper further shows that the method of 3 exponentials, although predicting accurately the in-phase component of current caused by reversible absorption, usually yields results of less than the true value in predicting the quadrature component. Charts are presented that reduce the computations required in the study of a great number of specimens."
"Current propagation and earth potentials for earth-return conductors with application to electric railway systems are discussed in this paper. General formulas are derived from which solutions may be obtained for problemes such as propagation of track currents and voltages, and earth potentials imposed on neighboring conductors."
"A new transient calorimetric method for measurement of dielectric losses in solids at 10,000 volts and 1,000 kilocycles, is described in this paper and experimental data obtained by this method are presented. A steady-state method also is described and a direct comparison between the results obtained by the 2 methods is given. The absolute value of loss factor (0.0009) determined for quartz shows exact agreement between the 2 methods. The transient method is shown to reduce the time or making calorimetric measurements on solid materials from hours to minutes. Results of tests on 15 samples, including 6 different low-loss materials, show that the absolute values of losses in these particular materials are of the order of magnitude determined by previous low-voltage high-frequency measurements. It is thought that the transient calorimeter technique can be readily extended to ultra-high frequencies."
"To provide additional bridges between the fields of mathematics and electrical engineering is the main object of this paper, which is a sequel to a previous work on dyadic algebra. The paper includes an application of Gibbs's directional ellipse to 3-phase circuits, a treatment of symmetrical components by using the isoclinic unit vector and 2 circular complex vectors and an exposition of dyadics as appplied to in 3-phase symmetrical machines."
"This paper applies the method of circular loci to the determination of the vector amplifcation of resistance-capacitance coupled amplifiers. It is shown that the locus for both exact and approximate equivalent circuits is the sum of 2 circles, whereas for the approximate circuits at high or low frequency the locus is a single circle. The locus of vector amplification for this type of amplifier may be drawn directly from the circuit constants and the magnitude and phase angle of amplification at any frequency read directly."
"In this paper the use of resistance-welding timers using igniter-type mercury-cathode tubes is reviewed briefly and a seam-welding control unit containing a new design of inductive timer is described, An ``ignition delay'' form of control of welding heat or current magnitude is presented in which one set of power tubes controls both current magnitude and time duration. Comparison is made with the tapchanging method; operation of several welding machines from one timer is discussed."
"A theoretical analysis of the method proposed by the AIEE committee on electrical machinery for measuring the negative-sequence reactance of synchronous machines is presented in this paper. The analysis proves that the method leads to a correct measurement of the negative-sequence reactance for the operating condition most frequently met in applying the method of symmetrical components, but that the method of measurement does not determine the correct negative-sequence reactance of the machine for the operating conditions used in the proposed AIEE test. The results of experimental tests are given to verify the theory presented."
"Supplementing the report of the annual meeting of the Engineers' Council for Professional Development and the excerpts from the annual reports of 3 ECPD committees published in the November issue (pages 1280-5), full text of the annual report of the ECPD committee on professional recognition is presented here. The report was presented to ECPD at its annual meeting held on October 6, 1936, but official action on the recommendations contained therein was deferred pending further consideration at a future meeting of ECPD. These recommendations are of far-reaching importance to all engineers, and particularly to members of national engineering societies. Comments on these recommendations are invited."

"In this address,1 republished here at the request of the Institute's committee on education, the author constructively looks ahead, discussing frankly the probable status of engineering education (and the engineering profession) in the post-depression era and suggesting adjustments in curricula to suit new conditions. He says ''there is no reason to predict a surplus of engineers when there is no diminution in the need for engineering services-man's wants are illimitable, if engineers have but the discernment to discover and the ingenuity to satisfy them.''"
"Supplementing theoretical studies on the protection of a-c rotating machines against impulse waves and previous tests on individual protective devices, a comprehensive series of tests on over-all protective schemes has been made. As a result, definite conclusions are drawn regarding the proper lightning protection for machines connected directly to overhead lines or connected through transformers, giving consideration to the type of transformer connection. Considerable information also is obtained on the propagation of surges through windings, and on the surge impedances of machine windings."
"The effect which the width of resistance rings has on the secondary resistance of squirrel cage induction motors has been subjected to a mathematical analysis. It is found that the width, in a radial direction, of these rings which connect the conductors of a squirrel cage rotor, need never exceed the pole pitch, and probably half of that value is sufficient. Methods for determining the current distribution in the resistance ring, and for determining the the effective width and resistance are demonstrated."
"Standards for inspection and test of electrical equipment for use in hazardous locations have been developed by the Underwriters' Laboratories. As the result of extensive research, considerable information has been made available on the explosion proof characteristics of motors and other electrical equipment in locations where there are highly flammable gases, volatile liquids, or other substances. Particular attention is given in this paper to explosion proof motors when subjected to that group of gases or vapors which have the lowest explosion hazard."
"In the ordinary method of solving electrical networks by means of the operational calculus, the equations usually are written with the restriction that the initial conditions be rest conditions, thus reducing considerably the utility of the operational calculus. In this article a method has been applied to the solution of electrical networks wherein the initial conditions may be either rest or dynamic. A general solution is derived by which it is possible to write all the initial conditions into an ordinary operational equation to which the usual methods of interpretation may be applied to give the complete solution all in one stroke."
"In designing and building the 132 kv transmission line crossing between Kanawake and LaSalle, Quebec, on the St. Lawrence River, the unstressed cable lengths were calculated, measured, and cut to be continuous over 3 spans. The calculated unstressed lengths were measured in the field while the cable was being erected, without delaying the stringing and without necessitating rehandling of the cable."

"As part of the Institute's celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the alternating-current system in America, which is being carried out under the auspices of a special committee,* this brief story of the inception and early history of the alternating current system has been prepared by 2 past-presidents of the Institute, both of whom were actively identified with the early development of the system, and both of whom have made many important contributions to the development and application of alternating current power. It is a story of achievement against the strenuous opposition of many prominent electrical engineers of that time. The present almost universal use of alternating current in the great electric power systems of today is in itself a fitting tribute to the genius and vision of George Westing-house and William Stanley who, through their long and persistent efforts under extraordinary difficulties established the first alternating current system in America on March 20, 1886."
"The question in the minds of many transportation men today is: ``What type of highway vehicle may be constructed that will embody the maximum number of respective good points of trolley car, trolley coach, and motor bus?'' The answer of one large eastern transport company to this question is the ``all-service'' vehicle, a combination trolley coach and gasoline-electric motor bus. The principal items of interest in a highway vehicle are performance, rider appeal, operating economy, and construction. As to performance, it appears that much yet may be accomplished. Recent experiments indicate the importance of the contribution that can be made by the electrical engineer to developments in this field."
"During the past few years, the subcommittee on fundamental sound measurements* of the American Standards Association has been considering definitions and test procedure pertaining to the calibration of microphones. The following report is a result of its work. At a recent meeting of the sectional committee* under which the subcommittee functions, it was voted to submit this work to interested scientific bodies for publication in their journals, with the thought of promoting constructive criticism and discussion."
"The theory of transients arising from the sudden application of a sinusoidal potential is presented in this paper, for the distortionless transmission line. The solution is given in the form of a series of damped sinusoidal traveling waves, the reflections diminishing progressively until the steady state is reached. Oscillographic tests on an artificial line containing lumped parameters are shown to corroborate the theory, and graphical methods are described which permit a quick computation of the successive traveling waves."
"A brief outline of the status of the electrochemical and electrometallurgical industry in Japan, including some figures on the production of various materials which have been obtained in recent years, is given here."
"Surge protection and open-circuit protection of current transformers may be obtained by the application of shunts in which the material known as ``thyrite,'' and which has a negative resistance characteristic, is used. The surge protector is connected across the current transformer primary, and the open-circuit protector across the secondary. Voltages across the current transformer winding are considerably reduced by the use of these protectors, with negligible effect upon the transformer accuracy during normal operating conditions, and without impairing safe operation of relays during system faults."
"Tentative standards for sound level meters, for measurement of noise and other sounds, have been prepared by a committee of the American Standards Association. These tentative standards are published herein so that they may be put to use immediately. Comments and criticisms are invited."

"Being essentially the full text of the address delivered in Chicago February 25 1936 in response to the receipt of the Washington Award ``in recognition of devoted, unselfish, and pre-eminent service in advancing human progress,'' this article is published at the instance of the A.I.E.E. committee on education."
"The situation in which the young engineer may expect to find himself under currently changing conditions in industry is discussed in this paper. Also, the education of engineers, undergraduate and postgraduate, is reviewed from a practical point of view in the light of circumstances likely to be involved in their early activities in industry. Suggestions are given concerning undergraduate curricula, and concerning education activities that could be carried on to advantage by the young engineer after entering industry. The necessity for a proper balance in various activities and in personal characteristics is emphasized."
"Rotating apparatus for Diesel-electric cars and locomotives is described in this paper and certain design and operating data are discussed."
"This paper is intended to be of practical use to transmission line engineers in that it shows how transmission line flashovers may be estimated and segregated into 1, 2, and 3 phase, and double circuit, flashovers. The method of calculation is comparatively simple and based upon analyses of statistical and analytical information."
"A method of computing the torque developed in a bipolar induction watt-hour meter, based upon the actual eddy current distribution in the disk, is presented herewith. A comparison between measured ured and computed torque for a model meter is included."
"To eliminate uncertainties arising from assumed constants involved in the calculation of sequence impedances, hield measurements of 60 cycle positive and zero sequence impedances of 2 sizes of 3-conductor underground power cable were made on the 27 kv system of a large eastern metropolitan company; the results are reported in this paper. While the principal results are applicable only to the particular system involved, they show that without the support of the experimental data the calculation of zero sequence impedance of feeder circuits in a system of this kind can be at best only roughly approximate."
"An equivalent circuit to represent 2 coupled circuits having distributed self -and mutual impedance and admittance is developed in this paper for the general case, and modified for certain specific cases. The application of these equivalent circuits for representation of coupled power circuits or a coupled power circuit and ground wire or metallic cable sheath with distributed grounding impedance in power system analysis is discussed."
"Insulating oils ordinarily used in tramsformers have high stability toward oxidation, and much effort has been directed toward reducing the oxygen absorption qualities of such oils. Contrary to usual practice, however, the tests reported in this paper were made with a readily oxidizable or ''overrefined'' oil on the basis that the oxidizing qualities of this oil will maintain, automatically an inert gas above the oil and thus reduce explosion hazards. On the basis of these tests, it is said that transformers equipped for restricted breathing can be operated with overrefined oil over long periods without servicing as far as the oil is concerned. Among the chief disadvantages of such oil is its high cost- approximately twice that of present commonly used oils."
"The manner in which the turn insulation of high-voltage line-starting a-c motors may be stressed severely by switching surges is described in this paper in such manner as to give both a physical and mathematical interpretation of the phenomena. The importance of the external circuit as well as the machine characteristics is illustrated. Methods are presented for estimating the severity of the stress and the advisable protection. Considerable test data are shown. The test arrangements are described in detail, because new methods had to be devised to obtain the needed data."
"Supplementing earlier research progress reports1 concerning the physiological effects of electric shock, the authors here present the results of a sereies of experiments made to determine the heart reaction to currents of different frequencies."
"A general equation (17) for the output of an induction motor operating under unbalanced conditions of applied voltage and primary and secondary impedance, is deduced in terms of frequency of applied voltage, slip, and rotor copper losses, General equations for the currents flowing in the windings are given in appendix I, from which the secondary copper losses, and hence the output and torque, may be calculated. Special conditions of partial unbalance also are considered."

The design and method of shipment of these transformers are described in this paper."
"Further study of the method of measuring voltages by the force between spheres is reported in this paper, comparison being made of results obtained by means of 100 centimeter spheres with those obtained by other investigators and by a proposed* new A.I.E.E. standard for 50 centimeter spheres."
"An investigation of the electrostatic fields and space charges surrounding a conductor at high potentials, both alternating and continuous, is reported in this paper. The importance of space charge in determining the distribution of electric gradient is shown on experimental apparatus the dimensions of which approach those of many power transmission and related structures."
"An analysis of the vibration of cables and dampers, representing the results of several years of research and laboratory and Field testing, is presented in this paper. In Part I, presented herewith, an explanation of the causes and nature of free harmonic vibration of the cable is offered followd by an of the cable is offered, followed by an analysis of the resulting stresses. In Part II, which is scheduled for publication in a subsequent issue, various ways or reducing the maximum stresses and means of controlling the vibration are discussed, including an analysis of the action of Stockbridge dampers. Applications of the formulas to specific cases are given, and comparisons are made with experimental data from laboratory and field."
"An exact method for calculating the regulation of transformers is developed in this paper, and compared with approximate methods for both 2 winding and 3 winding transformers. The present formula for 2 winding transformers in the A.I.E.E. test code is confirmed, and a similar formula is obtained for 3 winding transformers."
"By making use of suitably chosen components of current and voltage, the method of symmetrical components, which is so useful in the analysis of symmetrically wound polyphase a-c machines, can be extended readily to the analysis of unsymmetrical 2 phase induction machines, such as the capacitor or split phase motor in which the windings are not in space quadrature. Such extensions to this method, illustrated by a typical numerical example, are presented in this paper."
"Based on methods previously published for determining the loci of voltages and currents in a star-star circuit, the loci of voltages and currents in a general unbalanced delta-delta circuit are developed. A numerical example is given."
"Methods and apparatus are described in this paper for the measurement of amperage, voltage, and wattage, and for the calibration of meters and instrument transformers, by means of multirange precision transformers of special design. These methods are said to obviate the use of the multiplicity of primary standards commonly used in standardizing laboratories and to reduce the work of maintaining substandards in calibration. The methods and apparatus described have been used extensively in the laboratory and field by a large western power company; one of the principal benefits has been a noticeable improvement in the average accuracy of watt-hour meters on the system."
"Test methods and equipment developed for the laboratory production in cables of vibrations (standing waves) similar to those experienced in transmission line service, and for determining the relative susceptibility of different cables to conditions tending to produce vibrations, are described. The special magnetic drive used to produce and sustain cable vibration has no friction loss except air friction, and hence is well suited to the measurement of the small amounts of power required to vibrate the cables."
"A new test method is described for the determination of stray load loss in induction machines. By application to given machines, this method is shown to have an exceptionally high degree of accuracy. Values of stray load loss for the same machines are obtained by other recognized methods and results compared. Results support the validity of a previously described1 \"belted load-back method.\""
"A joint investigation of the effects of electric shock on the heart, extending over a period of several years, has yielded many significant results. It has been found that electric shock may derange heart action causing ventricular fibrillation without damage to heart tissue, but resulting in death within a few minutes. This heart effect establishes the maximum current that may be withstood safely for short durations. Threshold fibrillating currents were determined for different conditions of pathway, frequency, and duration using numerous anesthetized animals of different species, comparable in size with man. The discovery was made that the heart is susceptible for only about 20 per cent of its cycle. Successful recoveries from ventricular fibrillation were obtained with large animals of several species by high intensity shocks of short duration."
"The application of scientific principles and engineering methods in the incandescent electric lamp field is outstandingly successful, and is one of the distinguishing features of American engineering. In this paper methods of appraising the qualities of electric lamps are discussed. The wide difference in quality between lamps that comply with American specifications and those that do not, and the economic consequences of the use of lamps that are without benefit of scientific methods are indicated."
"In considering the subject of protecting communication circuits at electric power plants and substations by means of neutralizing transformers, this paper gives particular attention to the problems incident to the localized rise in ground potential caused by power system faults. Several specific installations are discussed and illustrated."

"In this paper an attempt is made to describe the general properties of the magnetic vector potential, to make clear its relation to the fundamental equations of electromagnetic theory, and to describe its use in the derivation of general relationships for electric circuit analysis. The concept of inductance is considered and a fundamental definition for this circuit parameter is presented. By emphasizing the manner in which the magnetic vector potential may be used in 2-dimensional problems at both high and low frequencies its value as a mathematical tool is shown."
"The results of wind tunnel studies of the vibration in specimen lengths of 5 types of transmission line conductors are presented in this paper. Measurements of the frequency and amplitude of vibration for various wind velocities, power required to vibrate the conductor in still air, and amount of energy taken from the wind by the vibrating conductor are reported for various conditions."
"The embodiment of the general method for obtaining successful commutation in a synchronous mechanical rectifier-inverter by the use of harmonic voltages is described in this paper, which reports the results of tests on a 50 kw experimental unit. This type of rectifier is shown to have satisfactory characteristics of power factor, regulation, overload capacity, and commutation under transient load conditions, and has good efficiency, especially at low voltages and light loads."

"Despite his handicaps, Steinmetz not only made the most of his native ability, but at the same time felt warm and active sympathy for his fellow men. His life and achievements are a genuine tribute to the conception and tradition of open-minded sympathy and tolerance of ability and ideas in America, no matter in what form or shape they may come. Upon recommendation of the A.I.E.E. committee on education, full text of the Tenth Steinmetz Memorial Lecture delivered by Doctor Swope under the auspices of the Steinmetz Memorial Foundation before the Institute's Schenectady, N. Y., Section, April 20, 1936, is presented herewith."
"The object of the studies described in this paper was to verify the supposition that certain types of short-duration longitudinal voltages appearing in communication circuits are caused by remote thunderstorms. By means of simultaneous directional measurements made in the frequency range below 40 kilocycles at 2 points as much as 900 miles apart, thunderstorms at distances of several hundred miles from one or both of these points have been located with a degree of accuracy great enough to permit conclusive correlation of the storm locations indicated by the directional measurements with the locations of recorded thunderstorms. Methods, equipment, and results are discussed."
"The severity of desert climatic conditions, the necessity for absolute dependability and for minimum maintenance, and the high voltage to be handled, required departures from established practice in the design of the enormous disconnecting switches for the 287.5 kv transmission lines from Boulder Dam to Los Angeles. This equipment and the considerations entering into its design are described here."
"About 2 years ago a series of researches was started to study the causes of dielectric loss, chemical deterioration, and electrical failure of oil impregnated paper insulation. Miniature technique has been developed so that at moderate cost specimens can be assembled in glass under accurately controlled conditions, subjected to high voltage life tests, tested periodically for electrical properties and finally examined minutely for changes in electrical, physical, and chemical properties. The results obtained in the first part of this program are presented herewith. Hypotheses now held regarding the effects of variations in several different factors on the life of oil impregnated paper insulation are discussed, and a description of the techniques developed for preparing and testing specimens is given. Illustrative examples are given of the results obtained to date from the correlation of life tests with microscopic physical and chemical examination."
"A theoretical analysis of dampers and conductor vibration is presented in this paper and certain new methods of eliminating or reducing conductor vibration are discussed."
"More than half of the highway fatalities occur during the hours of darkness with a quarter of the daytime traffic volume. This is significant of conditions beyond the control of driver or pedestrian. Campaigns for education of driver and pedestrian, to be effective both day and night, must be accompanied by measures to improve night visibility, such as systems of fixed lights along the highways. The use of automobile headlights is in-effective and unscientific. The financing of highway lighting service is a state and not a county or township function. It is a vital necessity for preservation of life and property on the highway, and may readily be financed by surplus funds from gasoline taxation."
"In this paper the mechanical failure of porcelain is discussed with special reference to 3 seldom recognized characteristics: the effect of the porcelain surface on the strength, the apparent anomalous distribution of individual mechanical test values, and the effect of time on mechanical strength. A method of evaluating the result of these factors on electrical insulator performance is suggested."
"The trend in recent years toward large concentrations of electric power at important centers and the necessity for stable transmission over ever-increasing distances have resulted in a demand for high voltage switching equipment with unusually short operating time. This paper describes the development along conventional lines of a circuit breaker of the deionizing grid type capable of interrupting within 3 cycles a short circuit on a 287.5-kv 60-cycle line."
"An extension of the development and application of methods of tensor analysis is given here, applied to the predetermination of the subsynchronous performance characteristics of salient pole synchronous motors."
"The influence of basic engineering principles on the evolution of the concentric winding type of high voltage power transformer during the past 2 decades is discussed in this paper with particular reference to 55,000 kva water cooled transformers which will step up 16.3 kv to 287.5 kv at the Boulder Dam power plant."
"The effect of grounded neutral Δ/Y or Y/Δ power transformers upon the performance of certain impedance and reactance relays is set forth in this paper, and formulas are developed for use in predetermining the performance of these relays under operating conditions."
"An analysis of the vibration of cable and dampers, representing the results of several years of research and laboratory and field testing, is presented in this paper. In Part I which was published in the May 1936 issue, an explanation of the causes and nature of free harmonic vibration of cable is offered, followed by an analysis of the resulting stresses. In Part II, presented herewith, various ways of reducing the maximum stresses and means of controlling the vibration are discussed, including an analysis of the action of Stockbridge dampers. Applications of the formulas to specific cases are given, and comparisons are made with experimental data from laboratory and field."
"Carrier pilot relaying has been regarded by many as the nearest approach to a perfect protective relay system; however, it has not been adopted generally because of its high cost. With the intention of making still further improvements and reducing the cost of carrier pilot systems, a careful investigation has been made. The results of the investigation are presented in this paper, and a new carrier pilot system, designed in accordance with these findings, is described."
"The theory and design of a new distance relay suitable for ground protection are described in this paper, and the results of 2 groups of extensive field tests are presented. These results demonstrate that the new relay performs in a manner that can be predicted mathematically, and that it avoids certain difficulties involved in the application of conventional distance relays to ground protection."
"Hydrogen cooled synchronous condensers now in use have a total rating of several hundred thousand kilovolt-amperes. During the last 2 years the use of hydrogen cooling has been extended frequency converters, and most recently to turbine generators. Several such machines now are being constructed. This method of cooling not only results in a reduction of machine losses and maintenance cost, but also makes feasible the construction of units with capacities greater than those of the existing air cooled units."
"A novel circuit arrangement that supplies a large current to a circuit breaker under test and then subjects the open terminals to a high recovery voltage has been used in testing the 2,500,000-kva 287.5-kv impulse oil circuit breakers built for the Boulder Dam-Los Angeles transmission line. A description of this arrangement, which makes available several times the apparent power of the testing apparatus, is given in this paper, together with oscillograms which show details of the arc extinction process not previously known, and the results of a study of voltage distribution."
"The purpose of this paper is to present a general method of impedance calculation equally applicable to all transformer circuits and all construction types. An effort is made to show how the ``circuit method'' can be used and to prove some of the circuit properties and relations that are pertinent to the problems involved."
"Engineers are concerned with the preparation of young men to serve a civilization and culture based largely upon the results of technological developments. This fact makes necessary a multisided, better educated, and more roundly interested individual. Combined with the increasing body of fundamental technical knowledge and high standards of technical education, the adequacy of a 4 year professional educational program has been challenged. Opinions regarding the situation are summarized herein, together with the activities of the Engineers' Council for Professional Development, through whose united program there is hope for a fuller understanding leading to the consummation of an accepcted philosophy and effective procedure."
"Linking the first studies of highway lighting with the present studies, this paper enumerates some aspects of the optical problem involved in producing satisfactory levels of brightness on typical pavements to insure adequate visibility under various weather conditions. Characteristics of incandescent, sodium vapor, and high intensity mercury vapor lamps are discussed, together with the designs of luminaires mounting heights, and spacings necessary to provide optimum conditions for vision."

"Electrical studies of living frog and human tissues emphasize the fact that data obtained from electrophysiological studies of frogs cannot be applied directly to human beings. These studies show that frog tissue is practically equivalent to a pure resistance and that human tissue is equivalent to a resistance with relatively high shunt capacitance. These characteristics are believed to influence the response to minimal shocks."
"The special application of step-by-step dial switching equipment to the handling of short distance toll telephone traffic was introduced in Connecticut in 1929, and has been extended gradually until at present approximately 46,000 toll messages per day, comprising 70 per cent of the traffic between exchanges in this area, are dispatched over the 1,367 circuits of the dial switching network. The resulting. service improvements and savings in operating efforts are discussed in this paper, and a brief description of the transmission and equipment characteristics of the system is given."
"The possibility of making use of transformer harmonic phenomena for frequency multiplication has long been recognized, but practical applications have been few. Within recent years, however, several frequency tripling transformers have been built for supplying 180 cycle energy to large electric horns and similar devices from 60 cycle sources. The inherently poor regulation of the output voltage and low power factor of the input circuit can be compensated in part by the use of series capacitance in the output circuit; at the same time the maximum output is increased considerably. Two suggested practical applications of these devices are for supplying 180 cycle energy to induction furnaces and to high-speed motor-driven tools."
"A grid-controlled arc-discharge tube which requires neither power nor time for heating the cathode, but in which a discharge of several hundred amperes is controlled by an extremely small amount of power in the grid circuit, is described in this paper. The tube has characteristics especially useful In circuits requiring large peak current but low average current, some examples of which are given here and is applicable particularly as a light source in stroboscopes."
"The board of directors of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers presents herewith to the membership its fifty-second annual report, for the fiscal year ending April 30, 1936.

"The application of tensor analysis to the problems of electrical engineering results in a great simplification of the mathematics involved in such a complicated system as that of a rotating machine, for tensor analysis provides the ability to generalize from simple individual cases to complicated groups and systems. Originally, tensor analysis was developed as a tool in advanced geometrical analysis, but has since found extensive applications in other fields. The purpose of this paper is to point out the value of tensors, and to serve as an introduction to further study."

"This paper treats in something of an elementary fashion some of the problems encountered in the practical application of the resistance welding circuit, considering especially the electrical constants and variables involved. The lack of available literature on this subject inspired the preparation of this paper."
"A voltage regulator using grid-controlled arc-discharge tubes as rectifiers under the control of a diode to supply field current for d-c generators is described in this paper. The regulator has demonstrated an over-all sensitivity of plus or minus 0.5 per cent with a supply voltage change of 10 per cent, and is comparable in cost to the usual electromagnetic regulators, but requires an a-c supply."
"This paper discusses and brings together the basic principles and relations necessary for the practical solution of problems involving 3 phase networks by the dyadic algebra developed by Gibbs. Emphasis is placed more on the utility of the method and the similarity between the new relations and those already well established for single phase circuits than on mathematical details of deduction or proof, which can be found elsewhere."

"A survey of electrical engineering graduates for the 8 year period ending 1935, conducted by the Eta Kappa Nu Association, honorary electrical engineering society, shows that 2,809 (average) have graduated annually from 135 American colleges during that period. The year 1934-35 appears to be the ``low point'' of both the 8 year period and the succeeding 4 years."
"A voltage regulating transformer, having a core so designed that the application of direct current to an additional winding will vary the core saturation and hence the output voltage, is described in this paper. Tests on a model constructed on this principle have shown that a wide range of regulation may be obtained, and that the wave form is not distorted."
"A nationwide transmission system has been established in the United States for teletypewriter exchange service by means of which 2-way communication between teletypewriter subscribers can be established in a time comparable with that required for long distance telephone service. A brief description of the principle of operation of teletypewriters is included in this paper as an introduction to the discussion of the transmission requirements and the plan of the present system."
"Calculation of the characteristics of a single phase parallel inverter supplying an inductive load is treated in this paper, which supplements a previous paper on the parallel inverter supplying a pure resistance load. The treatment is confined to the case in which the direct current is constant, no attempt being made to derive expressions for the case in which the direct current flows in pulses."
"The insulation between the heater wire and the cathode of electronic tubes of the indirectly heated cathode type is required to conduct heat while maintaining high electrical resistance at operating temperatures. By means of cathode-ray oscillograms the effects of operating temperature, heat treatment, and impurities upon the electrical conduction of the commonly used insulating materials are shown in this paper."
"Problems arising from testing with impulse voltages chopped on the rising fronts of the waves are discussed in this paper. A consideration of the generation and measurement of impulse voltages is presented briefly, and the problems are studied sented briefly, and the problems are studied in a discussion of the test results. The subject is treated nonmathematically and the results analyzed in terms of physical interpretation."
"Continuous measurement of the diameter of silk thread may be made and recorded by the apparatus herein described, which depends for its operation on changes in capacitance as variations in thread diameter move the jaws of a caliper. From the record the quality of the fabric may be predicted closely, and by the addition of integrating devices a numerical reading for quality rating may be obtained at the end of a run. The applications of the measurement in the control of knitting, limit testing, and quality rating are discussed, and the results of comparisons with present methods of rating the quality of raw silk yarn are given."
"Transmission of photographs over telephone wires was begun commercially several years ago, but recent improvements have increased to 11 by 17 inches the size of photograph that could be transmitted and have made it possible for the picture to give much more information. The new machines used for sending and receiving photographs are described in this paper, and the requirements and control of the wire system necessary to prevent imperfections in the picture and to permit switching of sending and receiving stations are discussed."
"The shaded pole motor is considered the most popular type of single phase induction motor in the small fractional horsepower range, and is widely used for driving fans. The general forms of construction are outlined in this paper, in which the equations for this type of motor are derived and the performance characteristics are discussed."
"The development of a nationwide teletypewriter transmission system in the United States required the design of switchboards and signaling facilities adapted to this special service. The 2 types of switchboard now in use are described in this paper, and the operation of the circuit by means of which connections are established between the various subscribers and supervised by the operators is explained."
"The recorder described in this paper was developed for measuring and recording the duration of subnormal voltages that result from system faults. The device is simple and inexpensive in operation, and records system disturbances as they occur."
"The use of air gaps between various forms of electrodes to discharge high surge voltages and thus protect expensive apparatus from damage is general, but such gaps vary in time delay and polarity characteristics and are difficult to co-ordinate with the insulation to be protected. By controlling the electrostatic field, the gap described in this paper provides a wide range of time and polarity characteristics that enables insulation co-ordination to be more readily effected."

"CENTURIES ago the responsibility of the individual citizen was a highly prized privilege that set him apart from barbarians and slaves, as it has ever since. Such privileges have been difficult to win and just as difficult to maintain. Indifference, corruption, widespread disaster, and dissatisfaction have led to gradual or revolutionary usurpation of freedom and the popular will. Also, the complications of changing conditions have been further increased by the rise in technology."
"Being essentially the full text of the address delivered in Chicago, February 25, 1936, in response to the receipt of the Washington Award “in recognition of devoted, unselfish, and pre-eminent service in advancing human progress,” this article is published at the instance of the A.I.E.E. committee on education."
"The situation in which the young engineer may expect to find himself under currently changing conditions in industry is discussed in this paper. Also, the education of engineers, undergraduate and postgraduate, is reviewed from a practical point of view in the light of circumstances likely to be involved in their early activities in industry. Suggestions are given concerning undergraduate curricula, and concerning educational activities that could be carried on to advantage by the young engineer after entering industry. The necessity for a proper balance in various activities and in personal characteristics is emphasized."
"Rotating apparatus for Diesel-electric cars and locomotives is described in this paper, and certain design and operating data are discussed."
"This paper is intended to be of practical use to transmission line engineers in that it shows how transmission line flashovers may be estimated and segregated into 1, 2, and 3 phase, and double circuit, flashovers. The method of calculation is comparatively simple and based upon analyses of statistical and analytical information."
"A method of computing the torque developed in a bipolar induction watt-hour meter, based upon the actual eddy current distribution in the disk, is presented herewith. A comparison between measured and computed torque for a model meter is included."
"WITH the conception and installation of the Pearl Street station in September 1882 in New York, the electric light and power industry became a fact, and from such small beginnings a mighty industry has developed. Afew weeks later the Appleton, Wisconsin, plant was started. The Appleton generators were driven by a waterwheel, and its successors using the sameprime mover dominate about a third of the central station industry. But Mr. Edison with a conception of a universal system of light and power supply saw with clear vision the possibilities of the steam engine as a primemover, and located his generating stations as nearly as possible in the center of distribution… independent of weather or rainfall or the presence of flowing water, he chose and adopted for his purposes the steam engine which Newcomen had invented and James Watt had perfected and adaptedto the transmission of power through a rotating shaft."
"To eliminate uncertainties arising from assumed constants involved in the calculation of sequence impedances, field measurements of 60 cycle positive and zero sequence impedances of 2 sizes of 3-conductor underground power cable were made on the 27 kv system of a large eastern metropolitan company; the results are reported in this paper. While the principal results are applicable only to the particular system involved, they show that without the support of the experimental data the calculation of zero sequence impedance of feeder circuits in a system of this kind can be at best only roughly approximate."
"An equivalent circuit to represent 2 coupled circuits having distributed self-and mutual impedance and admittance is developed in this paper for the general case, and modified for certain specific cases. The application of these equivalent circuits for representation of coupled power circuits or a coupled power circuit and ground wire or metallic cable sheath with distributed grounding impedance in power system analysis is discussed."
"Insulating oils ordinarily used in transformers have high stability toward oxidation, and much effort has been directed toward reducing the oxygen absorption qualities of such oils. Contrary to usual practice, however, the tests reported in this paper were made with a readily oxidizable or “overrefined” oil on the basis that the oxidizing qualities of this oil will maintain automatically an inert gas above the oil and thus reduce explosion hazards. On the basis of these tests, it is said that transformers equipped for restricted breathing can be operated with overrefined oil over long periods without servicing as far as the oil is concerned. Among the chief disadvantages of such oil is its high cost — approximately twice that of present commonly used oils."
"The manner in which the turn insulation of high-voltage line-starting a-c motors may be stressed severely by switching surges is described in this paper in such manner as to give both a physical and mathematical interpretation of the phenomena. The importance of the external circuit as well as the machine characteristics is illustrated. Methods are presented for estimating the severity of the stress and the advisable protection. Considerable test data are shown. The test arrangements are described in detail, because new methods had to be devised to obtain the needed data."
"Supplementing earlier research progress reports1 concerning the physiological effects of electric shock, the authors here present the results of a series of experiments made to determine the heart reaction to currents of different frequencies."
"A general equation (17) for the output of an induction motor operating under unbalanced conditions of applied voltage and primary and secondary impedance, is deduced in terms of frequency of applied voltage, slip, and rotor copper losses. General equations for the currents flowing in the windings are given in appendix I, from which the secondary copper losses, and hence the output and torque, may be calculated. Special conditions of partial unbalance also are considered."

"On June 14, 1935, The Engineering Foundation board adopted the following platform, which supersedes the platform of 1925. The new platform was approved by the board of trustees of Foundation on June 27, 1935, and during subsequent months has been approved by 4 Founder Societies."
"Rural electrification now has the support of legislation. The new act provides $42, 000, 000 per year for 10 years for the construction of transmission lines into rural areas and the construction of generating plants where an adequate supply of electricity is not available, or whereit cannot be obtained at what are thought to be reasonable prices. However, present rural electrification commitments range between 5 and 6 million dollars for about 5,000 miles of transmission lines to take care of 17,500 farm families. Money for these extensions is loaned at 3 per cent for 20 years. With few exceptions, these new lines are interconnected with privately owned utilities for their supply of electricity. This trend, bothin volume and in method, is following principles and recommendations earlier made by American Engineering Council committees and staff to the Rural Electrification Administration."
"To the Editor: Sections 121, 122, and 123 of the A.I.E.E. Proposed Test Code for Synchronous Machines gives a method of finding the voltage regulation and load field current of alternators.

"Power Consumption at Ford Plant. Electric power used by the Ford Motor Co. in the Detroit area during 1935 amounted to 658,247,947 kilowatthours, exceeding the 1934 output by more than 145,000,000 kilowatthours. Practically all of the company's total usage of electricity in the Detroit area was generated and consumed in the Rouge plant. An important part of the company's present program of expansion and modernization is proceeding rapidly in No. 1 power house. The new installation includes a 1400-pound pressure boiler, a 110,000-kw turbogenerator, and a 15,000-kw turbogenerator. When the installation is completed, this will be the largest high-pressure steam plant in the world. Its capacity will be increased from about 270,000 horsepower to about 435,000 horsepower."

"An address delivered before the annual business session of the 52d annual AIEE summer convention at Pasadena, Calif., June 22, 1936, by Vannevar Bush (A'15, F'24) Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, in response to his receipt of the AIEE Lamme Medal for 1935 “for his development of methods and devices for application of mathematical analysis to problems of electrical engineering.”"
"The application of tensor analysis to the problems of electrical engineering results in a great simplification of the mathematics involved in such a complicated system as that of a rotating machine, for tensor analysis provides the ability to generalize from simple individual cases to complicated groups and systems. Originally, tensor analysis was developed as a tool in advanced geometrical analysis, but has since found extensive applications in other fields. The purpose of this paper is to point out the value of tensors, and to serve as an introduction to further study."

The lack of available literature on this subject inspired the preparation of this paper."
"A voltage regulator using grid-controlled arc-discharge tubes as rectifiers under the control of a diode to supply field current for d-c generators is described in this paper. The regulator has demonstrated an over-all sensitivity of plus or minus 0. 5 per cent with a supply voltage change of 10 per cent, and is comparable in cost to the usual electromagnetic regulators, but requires an a-c supply."
"This paper discusses and brings together the basic principles and relations necessary for the practical solution of problems involving 3 phase networks by the dyadic algebra developed by Gibbs. Emphasis is placed more on the utility of the method and the similarity between the new relations and those already well established for single phase circuits than on mathematical details of deduction or proof, which can be found elsewhere."

"ALTHOUGH the Institute previously had held summer conventions as far west as Denver, Colorado (1928) and Salt Lake City, Utah (1921) the Fifty-Second Annual Summer Convention, held June 22–26, 1936, at the Huntington Hotel at Pasadena, California, was the first to be held on t he Pacific Coast. Judging by the full and widely representative attendance, by the active participation in technical and social affairs, and by the comments overheard in lobbies and meeting halls, the convention was unquestionably a success in every department and a credit to all who planned and conducted its several activities. Organized under the leadership of former Vice President R. W. Sorensen, and directly sponsored by the Los Angeles Section, the convention was actively supported by the other Pacific Coast Sections at San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Vancouver, Spokane, and Salt Lake City. Inspired by the Pasadena success, the San Francisco Section has launched an effort to obtain the 1939 summer convention for San Francisco in connection with the Exposition with which San Francisco expects to celebrate the completion of its 2 record breaking bridges, the Trans-Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate span."
"UNDER the joint sponsorship of the Sections committee and the committee on student Branches, the annual conference of officers, delegates, and members of the Institute assembled Monday and Tuesday afternoons June 2 2 and 2 3, 1936, in the ballroom of the Huntington Hotel, Pasadena, Calif., as a part of the summer convention activities. In addition to other interested persons, delegates from 5 8 Institute Sections and the counselor-delegates from all of the 9 Districts in which committees on Student activities have been organized, were present. A list of these is given in the accompanying tabulation. The total recorded attendance was 106"
"EFFECTIVE methods have been worked out by many Sections for improving thenactivities programs and for providing ways and means for more individual members to participate in Section and other Institute affairs. To effect an exchange of ideas and to reflect credit for constructive initiative where such credit is due, ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING has published such reports of these efforts as have become available. The essential substance of 3 such reports presented as part of the scheduled program of the conference of officers, delegates, and members held in connection with the Institute's summer convention at Pasadena, Calif., June 22–26,1936 is reflected in the following paragraphs."

"IN response to popular demands growing out of their successful innovation in connection with the 1935 summer convention at Ithaca, N. Y., 6 informal technical conferences were held in connection with the 1936 summer convention in Pasadena, Calif. These conferences were scheduled primarily for the benefit of the younger members of the Institute and the technical specialists in the fields covered by the conference subjects: High voltage X-ray tubes and allied apparatus, carrier current, mechanical properties of electrical conductors, synchronous machines, general transformer problems, and electron tubes in industry. Operated on the basis of no set program, the conferences were open for a general interchange of ideas and for the discussion of any particular problems or other matters of special interest to those attending."
"As previously announced, a 3-day meeting of the South West District of the A.I.E.E. will be held in Dallas, Texas, October 26–28, 1936; headquarters will be at the Adolphus Hotel. As an added attraction the $25,000,000 Texas Centennial Exposition will be in full swing atthat time. Here the dramatization of the onward march of a people in art, science, commerce, industry, education, and culture will be graphically depicted, and the story of cattle, cotton, and oil, which have raised Texas to the forefront of economic importance in a century, will be told in graphic exhibits. Dallas, a smartly cosmopolitan city, with its business center, residential sections, parks, and fine hotels, also provides an ideal location for the meeting."
"The June issue of the Monthly Labor Review, published by the U.S. Department of Labor, contains the first summary of statistics on the “Survey of Engineers'-' conducted in August and September 1935, by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in collaboration with the committee on engineering and allied technical professions of the American engineering council in co-operation with more than 100 national, state, and local engineering societies. More than 50, 000 questionnaires were returned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics for classification and codification. This is the first professional survey undertaken by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the returns are said to represent the largest sampling of the engineering profession ever made. An abstract of this report appears elsewhere in this issue."

"Ford Adds Power Distribution Equipment. — With consumption of electric power by the Rouge plant of the Ford Motor Co. at an all-time peak, work has begun on an addition to the power plant to house new distribution equipment. The structure together with equipment will cost approximately $420,000. The distribution equipment to be installed this year will provide 12 additional circuits intended to meet the requirements of immediate future needs. Provision has been made for the installation of 12 additional circuits at a later date, giving the power house a. total of 66 main power lines to the Rouge plant. The new circuits will give the power plant distribution equipment capable of handling a load of 265,000 kilowatts. The ultimate capacity of the power plant will be 345,000 kilowatts. The present generating equipment has a peak capacity of 265,000 kilowatts, including two 110,000 kw turbogenerators. One of these large units began operation only the latter part of July, when several smaller machines were withdrawn from service"

"Text of an address delivered June 23, 1936, at the annual conference of officers, delegates and members held in connection with the summer convention at Pasadena, Calif."
"The one-hundredth birthday of the state of Texas has been the occasion for the construction of a great exposition at Dallas. The success of such an exposition is dependent upon the electrical illumination, power, sound equipment, and signal and communication systems. This paper outlines the electrical features of the Dallas exposition."
"In connection with recent developments of new types of underground cables for high voltages, questions have been raised concerning the stability in service of impregnated paper insulation of the ordinary type. In addition to giving new data on the only reliable test method found for predetermining this stability — accelerated aging tests — this paper gives information on the mechanism of failure, and on the effects of variations in construction and materials. Long service life was indicated by the tests for good insulation of the ordinary type."
"Development of automatic voltage regulating equipment for installation on 4 kv distribution circuits at points remote from the substation has made possible a reduction in the cost of distribution by loading circuits to their economic carrying capacities unhampered by the limitation of voltage regulation. Investigation indicates 2 rules governing the application of booster regulators, and comparisons on the basis of cost per unit of voltage improvement shows which of the several devices available should be selected to secure the lowest cost. Tests have demonstrated the practicability of this form of regulation, and its field of application is indicated by economic comparisons with other methods of maintaining voltage within the required limits."
"Fuses made of copper that have been used as additional protection for transformers in low voltage networks in the event that the network protector should fail to operate may blow too quickly on brief overloads, and fail to blow on long-sustained overloads of lesser magnitude. By the combination of a fusible alloy of low melting point and copper blocks that delay the rate of temperature rise the fuse described in this paper provides a time-current characteristic which more nearly approaches the ideal."
"Obviously it is impossible to prophesy accurately what will happen in any phase of human activity. In the field of lighting, however, it is fairly safe to make some predictions based upon the following hypothesis: Throughout the world there are certain organizations and establishments which are unusually progressive, which do things before the ideas involved have been accepted generally. A study, therefore, of what is being done in these outstanding examples gives an indication of what is likely to become general practice in the next several years. On this basis the author analyzes lighting methods in certain definite fields, such as stores, restaurants, industrial plants, and streets. He describes installations of new types of illuminants and new methods of applying the older forms."
"A review of progress in illumination during the past 4 years has been prepared by the AIEE committee on production and application of light,∗ and is presented here. This report deals primarily with new types and forms of light sources and improvements in old ones. Some examples of modern applications of these new light sources are discussed in 2 other papers in this issue: “Today's Trends in Lighting,” pages 1100–10; and “Electrical Features of the Texas Centennial Central Exposition,” pages 1060–74."
"This paper describes an application of carrier-current relaying combined with rapid reclosure of circuit breakers by means of which the continuity of service to a large industrial load supplied by a long single-circuit line was improved. A 110-kv line 120 miles long, forming part of an interconnected loop, has been equipped in this way to clear faults and restore service in approximately one second. The effect of the connected motor load on circuit interruption is also discussed."
"A summary of practical operating experiences with a modern protective relay system over a 5-year period is given here, together with an analysis of significant results."
"On this and the following 14 pages appear discussions submitted for publication and approved by the technical committees, on papers presented at the sessions on power transmission and distribution, illumination, education, and conductor vibration at the 1936 AIEE joint summer and Pacific Coast convention held at Pasadena, Calift, June 22–26.

As announced previously in ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING (February 1936 issue, page 213), the award will consist of a silver-gilt medal accompanied by a sum in cash of 4,000 francs. The award will be made triennially to a person, regardless of nationality, who makes an important contribution in the field of electric storage batteries, voltaic cells, or electrochemistry in general."
"Among the new tentative standards for modifications of existing specifications and methods of test adopted by the American Society for Testing Materials at its annual meeting in Atlantic City, N. J., June 29–July 3, 1936, were the following:"
"Electric power is supplied to the Texas Centennial Central Exposition at Dallas, from 2 13,200-volt distribution stations on opposite sides of the grounds which feed 38 “load center” stations distributed throughout the exposition area, over an underground distribution system. From these “load center” stations, power is distributed to the load, which is chiefly lighting, at 120/208 volts. One of the 2 substations is shown below; it contains one 3,000-kva 3-phase transformer and one 1,500-kva 3-phase unit. A typical “load center” station is shown at the left; this particular station consists of 3 100-kva single-phase 2,400-volt transformers with associated equipment. Those attending the Institute's South West District meeting to be held in Dallas October 26–28, may be interested to see these and other units of the distribution system on the centennial grounds."
"Several symposia on various subjects have been scheduled for the fall meeting of American Society of Civil Engineers to be held October 13–16, 1936, at Pittsburgh, Pa. One of these deals with the subject of generation of energy. Papers are to be presented by engineers and economists on the following subjects: thermo-generation of energy, hydro-generation of energy, improvements in utilization of energy, cost of generation of energy, and economic aspects of energy generation."
"CONTRIBUTIONS to these columns are invited from Institute members and subscribers. They should be concise and may deal with technical papers, articles published in previous issues, or other subjects of some general interest and professional importance. ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING will endeavor to publish as many letters as possible, but of necessity reserves the right to publish them in whole or in part, or reject them entirely."
"Presents news of members' accomplishments or honors, appointments, or other announcements that would be of interest to the rest of the engineering community."
"Applications have been received at headquarters from the following list of candidates for election to membership in the Institute. If the applicant has applied for direct admission to a grade higher than Associate, the grade follows immediately after the name. Any member objecting to the election of any of these candidates should so inform the national secretary."
"A list of members whose mail has been returned by the postal authorities is given below, with the addresses as they now appear on the Institute record. Any member knowing of corrections to these addresses will kindly communicate them at once to the office of the secretary at 33 West 39th St., New York, N. Y."
"Transformers for Boulder Dam. — Four additional large power transformers have recently been purchased from the Westinghouse Electric & Mfg. Co. for the Boulder Dam Power Project. They will supply power to the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and are rated 55,000 kva each, single phase, 60 cycles, water cooled for stepping up from 16,500 volts to 230,000 volts. These transformers will take power from generator units No. 5 and No. 6, stepping it up to 230,000 volts, at which voltage it will be transmitted to the aqueduct pumping plants of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, a distance of approximately 237 miles. After installation, the transformers will be operated with the neutrals of the high voltage windings solidly grounded, but they are designed so that the neutrals can have a current limiting reactor installed later if it is so desired. Total weight of each transformer after installation will be approximately 125 tons."

"I DOUBT if the average member of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers has a full realization of the tremendous voluntary contribution by the officers and by the chairmen and members of the AIEE committees to “the theory and practice of electrical engineering and of the allied arts and sciences, and the maintenance of a high professional standing among its members.” The quotation is the purpose of our organization as expressed in our constitution."
"The new conditions of life brought about by the material advances of recent times, which have been achieved primarily as a result of the work of scientists and engineers, have brought with them new and pressing problems — social, economic, political, and international. In this address,∗ Doctor Durand states that “we (engineers) cannot evade the responsibility which rests upon us to take our due share, even the lead, in the study of the problems which our own activities have, in a large measure, developed.” He urges “a quickened sense on the part of the engineer, of his responsibilities, not alone in a purely professional sense, but as a citizen of his community, of his state, of his country, of the world.”"
"AS THE 1936 Great Lakes Exposition in Cleveland, Ohio, closes, it will be remembered primarily for its entrancing nighttime aspect. Although but 5 months in the making, the close co-operation of architects and illuminating engineers resulted in the application light in many new and interesting ways."
"Further investigation of the lightning performance of the circuit formerly known as the Wallenpaupack-Siegfried line is reported in this paper, which presents measurements of structure currents as made by surge-crest ammeters and additional data on the effect of counterpoises and ground wires."
"Cathode-ray oscillographs, a few years ago found only in research laboratories, have become extremely useful tools in the hands of operating engineers, research technicians, and teachers alike; however, the usefulness of cathode-ray oscillographs of the ordinary portable type is limited almost entirely to the observation of sustained periodic phenomena, and is of little use in the study of transients. Methods of extending the field of application of this instrument to include visual observation of circuit and line transients are presented in this paper."
"Formulas for practical use in the calculation of the resistances from grounding conductors of various forms to the earth are given in this paper and their use illustrated by examples. The accuracy of the formulas varies considerably, as discussed in the paper, but is sufficiently good that the methods should be helpful to those whose work involves problems of grounding."
"Predetermination of the a-c characteristics of dielectrics by d-c measurements was discussed in an earlier paper.1 The present paper further shows that the method of 3 exponentials, although predicting accurately the in-phase component of current caused by reversible absorption, usually yields results of less than the true value in predicting the quadrature component. Charts are presented that reduce the computations required in the study of a great number of specimens."
"Current propagation and earth potentials for earth-return conductors with application to electric railway systems are discussed in this paper. General formulas are derived from which solutions may be obtained for problems such as propagation of track currents and voltages, and earth potentials imposed on neighboring conductors."
"A new transient calorimetric method for measurement of dielectric losses in solids at 10,000 volts and 1,000 kilocycles, is described in this paper and experimental data obtained by this method are presented. A steady-state method also is described and a direct comparison between the results obtained by the 2 methods is given. The absolute value of loss factor (0.0009) determined for quartz shows exact agreement between the 2 methods. The transient method is shown to reduce the time of making calorimetric measurements on solid materials from hours to minutes. Results of tests on 15 samples, including 6 different low-loss materials, show that the absolute values of losses in these particular materials are of the order of magnitude determined by previous low-voltage high-frequency measurements. It is thought that the transient calorimeter technique can be readily extended to ultra-high frequencies."
"To provide additional bridges between the fields of mathematics and electrical engineering is the main object of this paper, which is a sequel to a previous work on dyadic algebra. The paper includes an application of Gibbs's directional ellipse to 3-phase circuits, a treatment of symmetrical components by using the isoclinic unit vector and 2 circular complex vectors, and an exposition of dyadics as appplied to in 3-phase symmetrical machines."
"This paper applies the method of circular loci to the determination of the vector amplification of resistance-capacitance coupled amplifiers. It is shown that the locus for both exact and approximate equivalent circuits is the sum of 2 circles, whereas for the approximate circuits at high or low frequency the locus is a single circle. The locus of vector amplification for this type of amplifier may be drawn directly from the circuit constants and the magnitude and phase angle of amplification at any frequency read directly."
"In this paper the use of resistance-welding timers using igniter-type mercury-cathode tubes is reviewed briefly and a seam-welding control unit containing a new design of inductive timer is described. An “ignition delay” form of control of welding heat or current magnitude is presented in which one set of power tubes controls both current magnitude and time duration. Comparison is made with the tap-changing method; operation of several welding machines from one timer is discussed."
"A theoretical analysis of the method proposed by the AIEE committee on electrical machinery for measuring the negative-sequence reactance of synchronous machines is presented in this paper. The analysis proves that the method leads to a correct measurement of the negative-sequence reactance for the operating condition most frequently met in applying the method of symmetrical components, but that the method of measurement does not determine the correct negative-sequence reactance of the machine for the operating conditions used in the proposed AIEE test. The results of experimental tests are given to verify the theory presented."
"On this and the following 2 pages appear all remaining unpublished discussions of technical papers presented at the general session of the AIEE North Eastern District meeting, New Haven, Conn., May 6-8, 1936.

"Discussion of a paper by G. F. Smith published in the April 1936 issue, pages 335–41, and presented for oral discussion at the general session of the AIEE North Eastern District meeting, New Haven, Conn., May 7, 1936."
"Supplementing the report of the annual meeting of the Engineers' Council for Professional Development and the excerpts from the annual reports of 3 ECPD committees published in the November issue (pages 1280–5), full text of the annual report of the ECPD committee on professional recognition is presented here. The report was presented to ECPD at its annual meeting held on October 6, 1936, but official action on the recommendations contained therein was deferred pending further consideration at a future meeting of ECPD. These recommendations are of far-reaching importance to all engineers, and particularly to members of national engineering societies. Comments on these recommendations are invited."
"TAKING its place among the largest and most effective of the Institute's District meetings, the sixth South West District meeting, held in Dallas, Texas, October 26–28, had a total registration of 533. Attendance at sessions was unusually large in comparison with the registration, and keen interest was maintained until the end of the closing session. All 6 Sections and 14 Student Branches located in the District were represented, and considerable numbers of students from certain schools attended, the total student registration being 179."
"FOR the ninth annual meeting of the National Research Council's committee on electrical insulation, some 110 or more chemists, physicists, electrical engineers, and others interested in the ramified subject of dielectric research gathered in Cambridge at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, November 5–7, 1936. Bound together by a common interest in the improvement of electrical insulating materials and methods, this loosely organized group has grown by wholly natural processes from the meager beginning initiated 8 years or so ago by a small group of farsighted leaders who saw the subject as one of fundamental importance to the electrical industry. These annual meetings, in addition to serving as a medium for the exchange of new information and for the frank discussion of new problems and new phases of old problems, also have served effectively as something of a proving ground for almost everything within the scope of the subject from new theories to new synthetic products."
"The special tuition scholarship at Columbia University placed at the disposal of the AIEE each year, which has been awarded to some student for many years past, was peculiarly affected by the rising barometer in business conditions which resulted in not one definite application for the scholarship for the academic year 1936–37, according to Committee Chairman W. I. Slichter (A'00, F'12, National treasurer). There were several inquiries early in the spring, but each of these inquirers failed to send in the definite information required of contenders, that is, academic record and supporting letters; this fact was interpreted by the committee to mean that the individuals had found employment that was more attractive to them than advanced study."
"On October 22, 1936, the trustees of the Carnegie Corporation of New York resolved that “the sum of $16,000 be, and it hereby is appropriated to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, toward support of the program of the Engineers' Council for Professional Development.”"
"INFORMATION regarding the finances of the Institute is now furnished to the membership on 2 occasions: first, in the report of the board of directors at the close of the fiscal year when complete financial statements are presented by certified public accountants, and, second, with the adoption by the board of a budget of income and expenditures for the appropriation year beginning October 1, as recommended by the finance committee."
"The executive committee of the Institute's North Central District (6) held its annual meeting in Denver, Colo., November 2, 1936. Those in attendance were: R. H. Fair, vice-president, District 6; N. R. Love, vice-chairman, Denver Section; R. H. Owen, secretary, Denver Section; H. M. Craig, chairman, Nebraska Section; W. H. Gamble, chairman, District committee on Student activities; and T. H. Granfield, District secretary. President A. M. Mac-Cutcheon also attended the meeting and contributed materially to the discussions relating to Institute policies."
"If there is sufficient demand, the power group of the Institute's New York Section will repeat the review courses in structural planning and design and in electrical engineering, with the first sessions to be held during the second week of February 1937. Applicants for, New York State professional engineers license who intend to enroll for either or both of these courses should put their names and addresses on file with Otto W. Manz, Jr., chairman of the Section's related activities committee, 55 Johnson Street, Brooklyn, N. Y."
"Charles Franklin (“Boss”) Kettering (A'04, F'14) was the guest of honor at a luncheon given Tuesday, November 10, 1936, at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City by Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., president of General Motors Corporation in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of Kettering's development and successful application of the electric starter for automobiles. The 188 other guests present constituted an unusual and impressive concentration of business, industrial, and educational leaders of national and international repute. Co-featured with Honor Guest Kettering was the evidence of his handiwork, the first commercially successful electric starter, pedestal-mounted and unveiled at the psychological moment, supplemented by an historic model of a Cadillac motor car, representing the model of 1911, to which the starter was first applied."
"Arthur Newell Talbot, professor emeritus of engineering in the University of Illinois, has been awarded the 1937 John Fritz Gold Medal, highest of American engineering honors. Professor Talbot, who is 79, was cited as “moulder of men, eminent consultant on engineering projects, leader of research, and outstanding educator in civil engineering.” The award is made annually for notable scientific or industrial achievement by a board composed of 16 pastpresidents of the 4 national societies of civil, mining and metallurgical, mechanical, and electrical engineers."
"On November 23, Brigadier-General R. I. Rees, assistant vice president, American Telephone and Telegraph Company died in Detroit, Mich., while on a field trip for Engineers' Council for Professional Development, of which organization he was vice-chairman. General Rees was one of the organizers of ECPD and one of its most active proponents. He was chairman of the ECPD committee on professional training continuously since council was organized, and was also chairman of its committee on ways and means. He was scheduled to retire from the telephone company on December 1, 1936, and thereafter to devote full time to ECPD."
"United engineering trustees, inc., was organized in 1904 as an instrumentality of the Founder Societies, the 4 national societies of civil, mining and metallurgical, mechanical, and electrical engineers. Its purpose is the managing of property and funds in which these societies have joint interests, and it is governed by trustees duly appointed by the societies as their representatives. It maintains 2 departments: (1) the Engineering Societies Library, and (2) The Engineering Foundation."

"A review of recent developments of investigations on nuclear structure, prepared at the request of the A.I.E.E. committee on education, is presented here."
"Electrical studies of living frog and human tissues emphasize the fact that data obtained from electrophysiological studies of frogs cannot be applied directly to human beings. These studies show that frog tissue is practically equivalent to a pure resistance and that human tissue is equivalent to a resistance with relatively high shunt capacitance. These characteristics are believed to influence the response to minimal shocks."
"The special application of step-by-step dial switching equipment to the handling of short distance toll telephone traffic was introduced in Connecticut in 1929, and has been extended gradually until at present approximately 46,000 toll messages per day, comprising 70 per cent of the traffic between exchanges in this area, are dispatched over the 1,367 circuits of the dial switching network. The resulting service improvements and savings in operating efforts are discussed in this paper, and a brief description of the transmission and equipment characteristics of the system is given."
"THE subcommittee of the A.I.E.E. committee on instruments and measurements that has been working for the past 2 years on a revision of the sphere-gap spark-over voltages which are published in A.I.E.E. Standard Number 4 has completed the revision of values for the sphere gap settings. These are published herewith to enable anyone so desiring to make use of these values pending completion of a revision of the text of A.I.E.E. Standard No. 4 at which time they will be included in the revised standard. It is intended that no further change will be made in the values in the meantime."
"The possibility of making use of transformer harmonic phenomena for frequency multiplication has long been recognized, but practical applications have been few. Within recent years, however, several frequency tripling transformers have been built for supplying 180 cycle energy to large electric horns and similar devices from 60 cycle sources. The inherently poor regulation of the output voltage and low power factor of the input circuit can be compensated in part by the use of series capacitance in the output circuit; at the same time the maximum output is increased considerably. Two suggested practical applications of these devices are for supplying 180 cycle energy to induction furnaces and to high-speed motor-driven tools."
"A grid-controlled arc-discharge tube which requires neither power nor time for heating the cathode, but in which a discharge of several hundred amperes is controlled by an extremely small amount of power in the grid circuit, is described in this paper. The tube has characteristics especially useful in circuits requiring large peak current but low average current, some examples of which are given here, and is applicable particularly as a light source in stroboscopes."
"The board of directors of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers presents herewith to the membership its fifty-second annual report, for the fiscal year ending April 30, 1936.

"In line with a suggestion made last fall by General R.I. Rees, chairman of the committee on professional training of the Engineers' Council for Professional Development (E.C.P.D.), the Junior Engineers' Group for Professional Development of the Providence (R.I.) Engineering Society was organized March 2, 1936. As plans mature and hopes are realized, it is expected that other centers of the engineering profession will try similar experiments."

He was born in San Francisco, Calif., March 31, 1855, and received his early education in public and private schools in that city. His professional training was received at Sheffield Scientific School, Yale University, and at the Royal School of Mines, Freiberg, Saxony, Germany."
"Without a dissenting vote the Edison Electric Institute, at its recent annual meeting in St. Louis, Mo., gave its endorsement to the “living memorial” now being established by the Thomas Alva Edison Foundation. Like other great industries that owe so much to Edison, the electrical industry will benefit from the plan of the Foundation since it is expected that many of those who are trained under the plan will make contributions to electrical development. The Foundation plans each year to select 100 exceptional young people whose aptitudes especially fit them for further education in the careers they have chosen. These Edison scholars will be known as the “living memorial” to the great inventor. In addition, the Foundation is to perpetuate Edison's memory by preserving his library, laboratory, and shops at West Orange, N.J., where he spent so many active years developing his great inventions."
"The Ninth Annual Meeting of the committee on electrical insulation, division of engineering and industrial research, National Research Council, will be held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, November 5, 6, and 7, 1936. Contributions to the technical program, reports on research in progress, and discussion in the field of dielectric theory and insulation should be sent to Dr. J.B. Whitehead (A'00, F'12, and past-president) chairman, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland."
"By recent action of the board of Trustees of Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pa., Prof. Bradley Stoughton, head of the department of metallurgy, has become Lehigh's first dean of engineering. The growth of engineering at Lehigh has continued steadily for many years, until finally co-ordination of the various engineering departments under one head became advisable"
"The retirement, this year, of Dexter S. Kimball, dean of engineering at Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y., recently was announced. He was born in New Brunswick, Canada, October 21, 1865, and graduated from Stanford University in 1896. He went to Cornell in 1899, remaining until 1901 when he became works manager for the Stanley Electric Manufacturing Company. He returned to Cornell in 1904, and in 1920 he became the first dean of the combined colleges of engineering."
"At a 2 day session on March 19 and 20 in New York, N. Y., committee. D-9 on electrical insulating materials of the American Society for Testing Materials reported much progress in advancing its work. In addition to completing work with regard to revisions of standard and tentative specifications and tests, there was outstanding discussion at the main committee and subcommittee meetings centering around such items as test cells for power factor and resistivity measurement of insulating oils, dielectric strength test of sheet and tape material, and conditioning requirements. In connection with insulating oils, committee D-9 has been attempting to secure a suitable test cell that would be inexpensive, but at the same time accurate and convenient to use. Several types of cells have been compared, and the laboratory results prompted considerable discussion. This involved the extremes in accuracy that miglit be desired by different interests, such as cable oil manufacturers, cable manufacturers, and operating companies. It is reported that these discussions and tests are bringing to light the desired information concerning the exactness of the present knowledge and limitations of equipment and measuring devices for power factor and resistivity of liquid insulation."

"All of the Washington palliatives have failed so far to make any real dent in the number of unemployed, according to the May “News Letter” of A.E.C. Estimates of unemployed vary from 8 to 14 million, but the estimators, whether they are on the high side or the low side, have not changed their estimates materially in 3 years. Statistics on unemployment, of course, are notoriously inadequate, but the broad fact remains that the total number of unemployed today is approximately the same as it was 3 years ago. Outside of this simple fact, however, the employment situation is full of paradoxes. It is known that there is a definite shortage of skilled help in the building trades in some localities and if there should be any large advance in the machinery industries, there would be a dearth of skilled mechanics, toolmakers, and other trained craftsmen."
"The recent publication in a single volume of American standards for rotating electrical machines marks an important step in the progress of standardization of electrical apparatus initiated by the A.I.E.E. in 1899. The present standard combined those standards of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association that are of general interest, and the entire scope of the former A.I.E.E. standards for d-c, synchronous, and induction machines, synchronous converters, and a-c and d-c fractional horsepower motors (former A.I.E.E. Standards numbers 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are now superseded by the new publication)."

"IN traveling around the country during the past 6 or 8 months, visiting various Sections and Branches throughout the West, South, and Southwest, I was very glad to see the entire membership taking such a lively interest in the activities of the Institute. Everyone with whom I talked seemed to approve the present policies and to be pleased with what is being done by the Institute as a whole."
"IT IS AN ALL TOO COMMON practice of scientific publicists and prognosticators to give free vent to their imaginations in a most unscientific way by picturing our descendants as flying through interplanetary space, after the manner of Buck Rogers or operating a navy with a thimbleful of transmuting atoms or banishing old age by administration of glandular extracts. No doubt many of the past triumphs of science were, relatively to the times, as spectacular and even more unexpected than these would be. However, scientific progress is not a great leap of imagination, but a steady process, like the advance of a great army; at times strategic positions are captured, as when the positive electron (positron) was discovered;at times there is a steady “mopping up” process all along the line, as when the systematic search for chemical isotopes followed the first discovery; at times there is retreat, as when a theory is proved untenable; at times a new powerful engine of this scientific war is invented, like the radio tube amplifier. While the scientific campaign is generally well planned in advance and directed toward certain main objectives, it also, on occasion, is opportunistic in that its center of activity may quickly be shifted by some new discovery or idea which discloses new territories to be conquered."
"Autotransformers rated at 65,000 kva recently built for use at the receiving end of the Boulder Dam-Los Angeles transmission lines are among the largest transformers so far constructed, and incorporate a number of new developments, such as a novel form of tank, an unusual arrangement of radiators and air blast equipment, and improved bushings. The design and method of shipment of these transformers are described in this paper."
"Further study of the method of measuring voltages by the force between spheres is reported in this paper, comparison being made of results obtained by means of 100 centimeter spheres with those obtained by other investigators and by a proposed∗ new A.I.E.E. standard for 50 centimeter spheres."
"An investigation of the electrostatic fields and space charges surrounding a conductor at high potentials, both alternating and continuous, is reported in this paper. The importance of space charge in determining the distribution of electric gradient is shown on experimental apparatus the dimensions of which approach those of many power transmission and related structures."
"An analysis of the vibration of cables and dampers, representing the results of several years of research and laboratory and field testing, is presented in this paper. In Part I, presented herewith, an explanation of the causes and nature of free harmonic vibration of the cable is offered, followed by an analysis of the resulting stresses. In Part II, which is scheduled for publication in a subsequent issue, various ways of reducing the maximum stresses and means of controlling the vibration are discussed, including an analysis of the action of Stockbridge dampers. Applications of the formulas to specific cases are given, and comparisons are made with experimental data from laboratory and field."
"An exact method for calculating the regulation of transformers is developed in this paper, and compared with approximate methods for both 2 winding and 3 winding transformers. The present formula for 2 winding transformers in the A.I.E.E. test code is confirmed, and a similar formula is obtained for 3 winding transformers."
"By making use of suitably chosen components of current and voltage, the method of symmetrical components, which is so useful in the analysis of symmetrically wound polyphase a-c machines, can be extended readily to the analysis of unsymmetrical 2 phase induction machines, such as the capacitor or split phase motor in which the windings are not in space quadrature. Such extensions to this method, illustrated by a typical numerical example, are presented in this paper."
"Based on methods previously published for determining the loci of voltages and currents in a star-star circuit, the loci of voltages and currents in a general unbalanced delta-delta circuit are developed in this paper. A numerical example is given."
"Methods and apparatus are described in this paper for the measurement of amperage, voltage, and wattage, and for the calibration of meters and instrument transformers, by means of multirange precision transformers of special design. These methods are said to obviate the use of the multiplicity of primary standards commonly used in standardizing laboratories and to reduce the work of maintaining substandards in calibration. The methods and apparatus described have been used extensively in the laboratory and field by a large western power company; one of the principal benefits has been a noticeable improvement in the average accuracy of watt-hour meters on the system."
"Test methods and equipment developed for the laboratory production in cables of vibrations (standing waves) similar to those experienced in transmission line service, and for determining the relative susceptibility of different cables to conditions tending to produce vibrations, are described. The special magnetic drive used to produce and sustain cable vibration has no friction loss except air friction, and hence is well suited to the measurement of the small amounts of power required to vibrate the cables."
"A new test method is described for the determination of stray load loss in induction machines. By application to given machines, this method is shown to have an exceptionally high degree of accuracy. Values of stray load loss for the same machines are obtained by other recognized methods and results compared. Results support the validity of a previously described1 “belted load-back method.”"
"A joint investigation of the effects of electric shock on the heart, extending over a period of several years, has yielded many significant results. It has been found that electric shock may derange heart action causing ventricular fibrillation without damage to heart tissue, but resulting in death within a few minutes. This heart effect establishes the maximum current that may be withstood safely for short durations. Threshold fibrillating currents were determined for different conditions of pathway, frequency, and duration, using numerous anesthetized animals of different species, comparable in size with man. The discovery was made that the heart is susceptible for only about 20 per cent of its cycle. Successful recoveries from ventricular fibrillation were obtained with large animals of several species by high intensity shocks of short duration."
"The application of scientific principles and engineering methods in the incandescent electric lamp field is outstandingly successful, and is one of the distinguishing features of American engineering. In this paper methods of appraising the qualities of electric lamps are discussed. The wide difference in quality between lamps that comply with American specifications and those that do not, and the economic consequences of the use of lamps that are without benefit of scientific methods are indicated."
"In considering the subject of protecting communication circuits at electric power plants and substations by means of neutralizing transformers, this paper gives particular attention to the problems incident to the localized rise in ground potential caused by power system faults. Several specific installations are discussed and illustrated."
"A report of experimental measurements of the heat transfer coefficients for air and hydrogen in laminar flow through rectangular ducts, and for flow conditions encountered through the use of velocities near the critical values."
"In this paper an attempt is made to describe the general properties of the magnetic vector potential, to make clear its relation to the fundamental equations of electromagnetic theory, and to describe its use in the derivation of general relationships for electric circuit analysis. The concept of inductance is considered and a fundamental definition for this circuit parameter is presented. By emphasizing the manner in which the magnetic vector potential may be used in 2-dimensional problems at both high and low frequencies its value as a mathematical tool is shown."
"The results of wind tunnel studies of the vibration in specimen lengths of 5 types of transmission line conductors are presented in this paper. Measurements of the frequency and amplitude of vibration for various wind velocities, power required to vibrate the conductor in still air, and amount of energy taken from the wind by the vibrating conductor are reported for various conditions."
"The embodiment of the general method for obtaining successful commutation in a synchronous mechanical rectifier-inverter by the use of harmonic voltages is described in this paper, which reports the results of tests on a 50 kw experimental unit. This type of rectifier is shown to have satisfactory characteristics of power factor, regulation, overload capacity, and commutation under transient load conditions, and has good efficiency, especially at low voltages and light loads."
"BY VIRTUE of its location and the excellent program arranged by the summer convention committee, the summer convention at Pasadena, Calif., June 22–26, 1936, affords members unusual opportunities to see many western developments and at the same time to keep abreast of the profession. The schedule of events includes the annual business meeting and 9 technical sessions to be held during the mornings. On the afternoons the conference of officers, delegates, and members, 2 student technical sessions, and technical conferences will be held in addition to sports and other recreation. Many places of scenic or scientific interest will be visited during the convention and the large engineering projects, such as Boulder Dam, the Metro politan Water District Aqueduct, San Francisco-Oakland Bay and Golden Gate bridges, Bonneville Dam, Grand Coulee, and Glacier Park maybe visited as preconvention or postconvention trips. Arrange your vacation plans so as to attend the summer convention at Pasadena. See the suggestion of a special train from Chicago with a tentative itinerary in ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING for April, p. 418–19, and reply promptly to the national secretary. Convention headquarters will be in the Hunting to Hotel."
"The d-c subcommittee of th e A.I.E.E. committee on electrical machinery earnestly requests that papers on the subject of determination of stray load losses in d-c machines be prepared and submitted to the Institute. It is the hope of the subcommittee that a session on thatsubject may be scheduled for the 1937 A.I.E.E. winter convention, the program for which already is being developed. Anyone interested in preparing sucha paper should communicate with Scott Hancock, chairman of the subcommittee, care of Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, East Pittsburgh, Pa."
"Recently compiled analysis of the readers of Electrical Engineering, embracing member and nonmember subscribers, and showing the principal occupational groups as well as the geographical distribution of the publication, is presented herewith. The analysis shows that more readers areemployed by electric power companies than any other branch of the industry, closely followed by the group engaged in electrical manufacturing. Naturally enough, the great industrial states have the heaviest representation. However, the compilation illustrates the comprehensive nation-widedistribution, as well as the extensive Canadian and other foreign circulation."

"A nationwide transmission system has been established in the United States for teletypewriter exchange service by means of which 2-way communication between teletypewriter subscribers can be established in a time comparable with that required for long distance telephone service. A brief description of the principle of operation of teletypewriters is included in this paper as an introduction to the discussion of the transmission requirements and the plan of the present system."
"The insulation between the heater wire and the cathode of electronic tubes of the indirectly heated cathode type is required to conduct heat while maintaining high electrical resistance at operating temperatures. By means of cathode-ray oscillograms the effects of operating temperature, heat treatment, and impurities upon the electrical conduction of the commonly used insulating materials are shown in this paper."
"Problems arising from testing with impulse voltages chopped on the rising fronts of the waves are discussed in this paper. A consideration of the generation and measurement of impulse voltages is presented briefly, and the problems are studied in a discussion of the test results. The subject is treated nonmathematically and the results analyzed in terms of physical interpretation."
"Continuous measurement of the diameter of silk thread may be made and recorded by the apparatus herein described, which depends for its operation on changes in capacitance as variations in thread diameter move the jaws of a caliper. From the record the quality of the fabric may be predicted closely, and by the addition of integrating devices a numerical reading for quality rating may be obtained at the end of a run. The applications of the measurement in the control of knitting, limit testing, and quality rating are discussed, and the results of comparisons with present methods of rating the quality of raw silk yarn are given."

The general forms of construction are outlined in this paper, in which the equations for this type of motor are derived and the performance characteristics are discussed."
"The development of a nationwide teletypewriter transmission system in the United States required the design of switchboards and signaling facilities adapted to this special service. The 2 types of switchboard now in use are described in this paper, and the operation of the circuit by means of which connections are established between the various subscribers and supervised by the operators is explained."
"The recorder described in this paper was developed for measuring and recording the duration of subnormal voltages that result from system faults. The device is simple and inexpensive in operation, and records system disturbances as they occur."
"The use of air gaps between various forms of electrodes to discharge high surge voltages and thus protect expensive apparatus from damage is general, but such gaps vary in time delay and polarity characteristics and are difficult to co-ordinate with the insulation to be protected. By controlling the electrostatic field, the gap described in this paper provides a wide range of time and polarity characteristics that enables insulation co-ordination to be more readily effected."

The control equipment is practically inertialess and, therefore, is almost instantaneous in its operation. The circuit may be compounded to have a wide variety of characteristics."
"Characteristics of polyphase induction motors are analyzed in this paper by the method of symmetrical components in a manner different from other recently published articles. The analysis is neither tedious nor highly involved, and curves of motor characteristics obtained by tests under unbalanced conditions agree closely with curves obtained by calculation."
"The application of tensor algebra to the solution of multiwinding transformer circuits is discussed in this paper for comparison with the methods more commonly used for the solution of such circuits. By means of the applications to transformer circuits given herein, elementary tensor methods are illustrated."
"Conversations with foreign delegates to the Third World Power Conference held in Washington, D. C., during the early part of September, prompted Editor L. W. W. Morrow (A'13, F'25, director) of “Electrical World” to write the accompanying editorial, which is reprinted by permission from the September 26, 1936, issue of that publication."
"The method of tensors, as applied to the analysis of electrical systems, has gained favor because of its versatility. The most common application of the method in electrical engineering is the analysis of the dynamics of rotating machinery, but a further application is presented in this paper. The attack includes flexible analyses of the characteristics of triodes, tetrodes, and pentodes, and their use as amplifiers, oscillators, and modulators."

"Building Recovery Here? — The much needed recovery in residential building, believed by observers as necessary to support the wide gains in business generally, is here, according to a late report of F. W. Dodge Corp., New York. For the first 9 months of 1936 this class of construction totaled 23 per cent more than was reported for the entire year 1935. The full year 1936 promises to reach a volume three times the size shown for either 1933 or 1934 the low-points of the depression. The volume of residential building in the 37 eastern states during the first 9 months of 1936 amounted to $588,030,600 as against only $338,907,500 for the same 9 months of 1935, a gain of 73 per cent."

"As part of the Institute's celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the alternating-current system in America, which is being carried out under the auspices of a special committee,∗ this brief story of the inception and early history of the alternating current system has been prepared by 2 pastpresidents of the Institute, both of whom were actively identified with the early development of the system, and both of whom have made many important contributions to the development and application of alternating current power. It is a story of achievement against the strenuous opposition of many prominent electrical engineers of that time. The present almost universal use of alternating current in the great electric power systems of today is in itself a fitting tribute to the genius and vision of George Westinghouse and William Stanley who, through their long and persistent efforts under extra-ordinary difficulties established the first alternating current system in America on March 20, 1886."
"The question in the minds of many transportation men today is: “What type of highway vehicle may be constructed that will embody the maximum number of respective good points of trolley car, trolley coach, and motor bus?” The answer of one large eastern transport company to this question is the “all-service” vehicle, a combination trolley coach and gasoline-electric motor bus. The principal items of interest in a highway vehicle are performance, rider appeal, operating economy, and construction. As to performance, it appears that much yet may be accomplished. Recent experiments indicate the importance of the contribution that can be made by the electrical engineer to developments in this field."
"During the past few years, the subcommittee on fundamental sound measurements∗ of the American Standards Association has been considering definitions and test procedure pertaining to the calibration of microphones.

At a recent meeting of the sectional committee∗ under which the subcommittee functions, it was voted to submit this work to interested scientific bodies for publication in their journals, with the thought of promoting constructive criticism and discussion."
"The theory of transients arising from the sudden application of a sinusoidal potential is presented in this paper, for the distortionless transmission line. The solution is given in the form of a series of damped sinusoidal traveling waves, the reflections diminishing progressively until the steady state is reached. Oscillographic tests on an artificial line containing lumped parameters are shown to corroborate the theory, and graphical methods are described which permit a quick computation of the successive traveling waves."

"Surge protection and open-circuit protection of current transformers may be obtained by the application of shunts in which the material known as “thyrite,” and which has a negative resistance characteristic, is used. The surge protector is connected across the current transformer primary, and the open-circuit protector across the secondary. Voltages across the current transformer winding are considerably reduced by the use of these protectors, with negligible effect upon the transformer accuracy during normal operating conditions, and without impairing safe operation of relays during system faults."

"RECENTLY I had the pleasure of attending the annual meeting of the American Engineering Council held at the Mayflower Hotel, Washington, D. C. The majority of members of the Institute are familiar, I believe, with the development of American Engineering Council from the time that a joint body, Engineering Council, was created by the 4 Founder Societies in 1917 for the purpose of establishing an agency to deal with matters of common interest to engineers and to serve as an instrument for contact between engineers and the general public in so far as such matters concern the engineering profession and the public welfare. Fundamentally, this body provides the means whereby unified action may be taken when necessary, either to promote a more enlightened public opinion, or to safeguard in a proper way the interests of the members of the engineering profession."
"In this address,1 republished here at the request of the Institute's committee on education, the author constructively looks ahead, discussing frankly the probable status of engineering education (and the engineering profession) in the post-depression era and suggesting adjustments in curricula to suit new conditions. He says “there is no reason to predict a surplus of engineers when there is no diminution in the need for engineering services — man's wants are illimitable, if engineers have but the discernment to discover and the ingenuity to satisfy them.”"
"Supplementing theoretical studies on the protection of a-c rotating machines against impulse waves and previous tests on individual protective devices, a comprehensive series of tests on over-all protective schemes has been made. As a result, definite conclusions are drawn regarding the proper lightning protection for machines connected directly to overhead lines or connected through transformers, giving consideration to the type of transformer connection. Considerable information also is obtained on the propagation of surges through windings, and on the surge impedances of machine windings."
"The effect which the width of resistance rings has on the secondary resistance of squirrel cage induction motors has been subjected to a mathematical analysis. It is found that the width, in a radial direction, of these rings which connect the conductors of a squirrel cage rotor, need never exceed the pole pitch, and probably half of that value is sufficient. Methods for determining the current distribution in the resistance ring, and for determining the the effective width and resistance are demonstrated."
"Standards for inspection and test of electrical equipment for use in hazardous locations have been developed by the Underwriters' Laboratories. As the result of extensive research, considerable information has been made available on the explosion proof characteristics of motors and other electrical equipment in locations where there are highly flammable gases, volatile liquids, or other substances. Particular attention is given in this paper to explosion proof motors when subjected to that group of gases or vapors which have the lowest explosion hazard."
"In the ordinary method of solving electrical networks by means of the operational calculus, the equations usually are written with the restriction that the initial conditions be rest conditions, thus reducing considerably the utility of the operational calculus. In this article a method has been applied to the solution of electrical networks wherein the initial conditions may be either rest or dynamic. A general solution is derived by which it is possible to write all the initial conditions into an ordinary operational equation to which the usual methods of interpretation may be applied to give the complete solution all in one stroke."
"In designing and building the 132 kv transmission line crossing between Kanawake and LaSalle, Quebec, on the St. Lawrence River, the unstressed cable lengths were calculated, measured, and cut to be continuous over 3 spans. The calculated unstressed lengths were measured in the field while the cable was being erected, without delaying the stringing and without necessitating rehandling of the cable."

The scholarship pays the annual tuition fees of $380. Reappointment of the student to the scholarship for the completion of his course is conditioned upon the maintenance of a good standing in his work."
"To celebrate its 50th anniversary, the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company gathered together its employees in special meetings held simultaneously on the evening of January 8, 1936, in cities where the company is represented by factories, offices, warehouses, subsidiaries, or dealers. This date was exactly 50 years from the date in 1886 when the company was granted its original charter “for the manufacture of electrical products.” The headquarters anniversary meeting was held in Pittsburgh, Pa., and provided the key program for all other meetings. The celebration was featured by addresses by A. W. Robertson (A'27) chairman of the board, and F. A. Merrick (A'07) president. Shortwave radio communication was used to link together this country-wide celebration."
"I HE sixteenth annual meeting of American engineering council was held in Washington, D. C, on January 10 and 11, 1936. Delegates from the 42 member organizations discussed the growing evidence of unity in the profession as to the formulation and dissemination of opinion on matters of public affairs. The assembly acted upon reports from 16 major and minor committees and subcommittees of the Council, listened to stimulating addresses at the “all engineers dinner,” attended by some 450 engineers, and left Washington with renewed expressions of the opportunities for advancing the public interest and for maintaining high professional standards through the agency of A.E.C. A report of the meeting, as furnished by Frederick M. Feiker, executive secretary, follows."

"Business Attributable to New Developments. — Indicating the importance of sustained industrial research, an analysis for the five depression years 1930–1934 shows that the ratio between business attributable to “new” lines of products (that is, lines not manufactured more than ten years prior to the year under consideration) and total business for all lines manufactured by the General Electric Company, was, on the average, approximately 10 per cent higher than for the five prosperity years 1926–30. Being based on entire lines, the above analysis excludes many important new developments within lines manufactured more than ten years prior to the year under consideration. The analysis, therefore, is on the conservative side."

"THIS issue of ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING ushers in a New Year for the electrical industry. While this is a fitting occasion to extend good wishes and to make good resolutions, it seems to me that it is a time, also, when we should pause for a moment to take our bearings."
"This address,1 tracing the interesting history and significance of the many concepts of electricity as they have evolved from an indefinite beginning through the extremely rapid developments of the current century toward a speculative future, is republished here at the request of the Institute's committee on education."
"The results of a survey by the A.I.E.E. lightning and insulator subcommittee∗ of the methods used to reduce the effect of lightning on existing transmission lines for medium and high voltages are given in this paper, which summarizes data obtained by means of a questionnaire sent to various operating companies."
"Permanent magnet materials recently have been developed with characteristics radically different from those of previous materials, the carbon, cobalt, and chromium steels. In this paper, the essential properties of these new materials are discussed and are compared with the corresponding properties of the older materials. Development of these new materials has broadened the range of properties from which the designer may choose, and has made available high specific magnetic performance in the low price field."
"Temperature distribution and heat flow in electrical conductors have been subjected to a mathematical analysis, which brings out a number of interesting thermal characteristics of conductors. The material presented in this paper is divided into 2 principal parts, the first being a general solution of the problem of determining temperature and heat distribution in conductors, and the second containing the development of the theory of the electrothermic ammeter of the thermocouple type, together with its compensation features. Practical applications of the theory are presented."
"A brief outline of the essential characteristics of high power audio transformers for class B amplification (tubes connected in push-pull fashion with their grid voltages of such value that the anode current is zero when there is no signal) is given here together with a brief description of the units used in the third and fourth stages of radiobroadcast station WLW."
"The application of supervisory control equipment and electric pump drive to municipal waterworks systems results not only in greatly improved operation, but also in a reduction in operating costs. Existing waterworks systems may be modernized and many improvements secured by the application of various types of electrical equipment. As an illustration of the benefits which may be obtained, a description is given of the modernization of the waterworks system of the city of Pittsburgh, where electric operation of pumps, together with supervisory control, remote metering, and remote indication, are now used."
"Power dispatching on an interconnected electric power system has been simplified and greatly improved by the adoption of a remote metering and automatic load control scheme recently developed. Remote metering at the power dispatching center provides continuous indication of the load on a distant 110-kv interconnection. The equipment also provides automatic control of the load on a hydroelectric generating plant located 160 miles from the metering point. The scheme, operating over company owned telephone lines, is based upon maintaining a constant beat frequency in the receiving apparatus, the transmission frequency being varied. Maintenance cost of the equipment is found to be negligible."
"With the object of determining the effectiveness of the newer methods of protecting distribution transformers from lightning, a survey of operating data obtained during 1934 by 38 electric power companies has been made by the transmission and distribution committee of the Edison Electric Institute. The results of this survey are presented herewith. In general, interconnection of the lightning arrester ground with the secondary neutral has been found superior to other methods of protection."
"As part of the modernization symposium scheduled for the 1936 winter convention, the A.I.E.E. transformer and lightning arrester subcommittees∗ have prepared this joint report, which summarizes briefly methods now available for protecting transformers against both traveling waves and direct strokes."
"Relay systems used for the protection of power transmission networks are now available which are greatly superior to those in use some 5 years ago. The principal change has been the development of the high speed relay, the operating time of which may be as low as one cycle or less on a 60 cycle system. Modernization of existing relay systems frequently may be accomplished by the addition of the new relays to the present relay scheme, thereby avoiding the cost of an entirely new relay system. High speed relays, especially when used with high speed circuit breakers, result in reduction of damage at stations and on lines, and give improved system stability and operation; reduction of outages on equipment of industrial customers has been an important advantage. This paper on modernization of relay systems is presented under the sponsorship of the relay subcommittee of the A.I.E.E. committee on protective devices."
"Analyses of field measurements of lightning disturbances and of operating experience on a metropolitan electric power distribution system have yielded valuable information on protective methods. Performance records of transformers, fuses, lightning arresters, meters, and customers' equipment with the interconnection method of protection (arrester ground and secondary neutral interconnected) are analyzed. Experience with protective methods for underground cables and for stud type of distribution transformers is cited, and an a-c method of testing arresters is described."
"Supervisory control and remote metering installations on the electrified section of the Pennsylvania Railroad are outlined herein. A brief history of the growth of electrification on this railroad, and of the supervisory control and remote metering installations which accompanied the electrification is given, together with the locations at which the different types of equipment are used. These remote metering and control systems have been of considerable assistance in load dispatching and substation operation."
"Engineering and practice in electric power distribution systems have kept pace with modern developments in other lines. Many improvements in system design and in details of equipment and construction have been produced in recent years which make for economy, better service, greater safety, and better appearance. The most important of these are discussed with indications of future trends."
"Early applications of lightning arresters were hindered not only by high cost, but also by the general lack of knowledge of both the characteristics of lightning and the protective characteristics of the arresters themselves. Present knowledge of these factors, however, achieved as a result of extensive field and laboratory research, has made possible the production of arresters having greatly improved characteristics and at much lower costs, which has led to their extensive use for protecting transformers and other equipment. This paper presents a brief review of the history of lightning arresters, and discusses factors affecting their economic application to electric power systems."
"Experiments with oxidized and oxide-free materials indicate that the electrical characteristics of the ordinary sliding contact, such as that between a carbon or graphite brush and a copper slip ring, are dependent upon the oxide film on the surface of the ring. Results of these experiments are presented in this paper, together with an explanation of the breakdown of this oxide film by the increase of current through the contact, based upon these results. Tests to determine the effects of liquid films on the contact voltage drop, and the variation of thermal voltage in a sliding contact also are reported."
"Automatic control for steel-tank mercury-arc rectifiers may be considered under 2 main divisions, one being control for switching equipment, and the other being control of the unit auxiliaries such as tank heaters, anode heaters, vacuum control and protective equipment, arc ignition and excitation, cooling tank, and circulating pump. A review of present day practice in automatic control for mercury arc rectifiers is presented herewith."
"Although the characteristics of ultra-high frequency radio communication between fixed points have been established fairly well, the utilization of these frequencies in communication between front and rear of moving railway trains presented problems of which little was known. This paper reports the results of extensive tests made to determine the practical value of these frequencies for such service, and describes commercial equipment subsequently developed."
"Summary form only given. The national nominating committee of the A.I.E.E. will meet during the winter convention, New York, NY, USA, January 28- 31, 1936, for the purpose of nominating national officers to be voted upon by the membership in the spring of 1936. The national nominating committee which has been named in accordance with the By-laws is listed. The amended provisions of the constitution and by-laws relating to nomination of officers were given in ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING for November 1935, page 1270, wherein members were invited to submit suggestions for nominations not later than December 15, 1935. The methods whereby nominations also may be made independent of the nominating committee were given in that item. Briefly, independent nominations may be made by a petition of 25 or more members sent to the national secretary at Institute headquarters, not later than March 25, to be placed before the nominating committee for inclusion in the ballot of such candidates as are eligible. Petitions for the nomination of vice president may be signed only by members within the District concerned."
"A brief biography of Edwin Wilbur Rice, Jr. is given highlighting his professional achievements. The executive committee of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE), upon behalf of the membership, hereby expresses deep regret at the death of Doctor Rice, and records its high appreciation of his many contributions to Institute development and activities."
"March 20, 1936, will mark the 50th anniversary of the memorable March 20, 1886, when, at Great Barrington, Mass., William Stanley placed in successful operation his experimental alternating current electric power distributing system, thus demonstrating the commercial feasibility of the a-c system."

"EDUCATIONAL ADVANTAGES and the fortunate graces bestowed by birth and breeding may serve to ornament individual resourcefulness, but they cannot take its place, nor can they, within themselves, justify discriminations in a common experience. Within every man is the latent power to increase his material possessions andto raise his standing among men. However, the attainment of these ideals is contingent, first, upon the desire; second, upon the constant application of energy; and third, upon the vigilance to take advantage of every available opportunity."
"Despite his handicaps, Steinmetz not only made the most of his native ability, but at the same time felt warm and active sympathy for his fellow men. His life and achievements are a genuine tribute to the conception and tradition of open-minded sympathy and tolerance of ability and ideas in America, no matter in what form or shape they may come. Upon recommendation of the A.I.E.E. committee on education, full text of the Tenth Steinmetz Memorial Lecture delivered by Doctor Swope under the auspices of the Steinmetz Memorial Foundation before the Institute's Schenectady, N. Y., Section, April 20, 1936, is presented herewith."
"The object of the studies described in this paper was to verify the supposition that certain types of short-duration longitudinal voltages appearing in communication circuits are caused by remote thunderstorms. By means of simultaneous directional measurements made in the frequency range below 40 kilocycles at 2 points as much as 900 miles apart, thunderstorms at distances of several hundred miles from one or both of these points have been located with a degree of accuracy great enough to permit conclusive correlation of the storm locations indicated by the directional measurements with the locations of recorded thunderstorms. Methods, equipment, and results are discussed."
"The severity of desert climatic conditions, the necessity for absolute dependability and for minimum maintenance, and the high voltage to be handled, required departures from established practice in the design of the enormous disconnecting switches for the 287.5 kv transmission lines from Boulder Dam to Los Angeles. This equipment and the considerations entering into its design are described here."
"About 2 years ago a series of researches was started to study the causes of dielectric loss, chemical deterioration, and electrical failure of oil impregnated paper insulation. Miniature technique has been developed so that at moderate cost specimens can be assembled in glass under accurately controlled conditions, subjected to high voltage life tests, tested periodically for electrical properties and finally examined minutely for changes in electrical, physical, and chemical properties. The results obtained in the first part of this program are presented herewith. Hypotheses now held regarding the effects of variations in several different factors on the life of oil impregnated paper insulation are discussed, and a description of the techniques developed for preparing and testing specimens is given. Illustrative examples are given of the results obtained to date from the correlation of life tests with microscopic physical and chemical examination."
"A theoretical analysis of dampers and conductor vibration is presented in this paper and certain new methods of eliminating or reducing conductor vibration are discussed."
"More than half of the highway fatalities occur during the hours of darkness with a quarter of the daytime traffic volume. This is significant of conditions beyond the control of driver or pedestrian. Campaigns for education of driver and pedestrian, to be effective both day and night, must be accompanied by measures to improve night visibility, such as systems of fixed lights along the highways. The use of automobile headlights is ineffective and unscientific. The financing of highway lighting service is a state and not a county or township function. It is a vital necessity for preservation of life and property on the highway, and may readily be financed by surplus funds from gasoline taxation."
"In this paper the mechanical failure of porcelain is discussed with special reference to 3 seldom recognized characteristics: the effect of the porcelain surface on the strength, the apparent anomalous distribution of individual mechanical test values, and the effect of time on mechanical strength. A method of evaluating the result of these factors on electrical insulator performance is suggested."
"The trend in recent years toward large concentrations of electric power at important centers and the necessity for stable transmission over ever-increasing distances have resulted in a demand for high voltage switching equipment with unusually short operating time. This paper describes the development along conventional lines of a circuit breaker of the deionizing grid type capable of interrupting within 3 cycles a short circuit on a 287.5-kv 60-cycle line."
"An extension of the development and application of methods of tensor analysis is given here, applied to the predetermination of the subsynchronous performance characteristics of salient pole synchronous motors."
"The influence of basic engineering principles on the evolution of the concentric winding type of high voltage power transformer during the past 2 decades is discussed in this paper with particular reference to 55,000 kva water cooled transformers which will step up 16.3 kv to 287.5 kv at the Boulder Dam power plant."
"The effect of grounded neutral Δ/Y or ΔY power transformers upon the performance of certain impedance and reactance relays is set forth in this paper, and formulas are developed for use in predetermining the performance of these relays under operating conditions."
"An analysis of the vibration of cables and dampers, representing the results of several years of research and laboratory and field testing, is presented in this paper. In Part I which was published in the May 1936 issue, an explanation of the causes and nature of free harmonic vibration of cable is offered, followed by an analysis of the resulting stresses. In Part II, presented herewith, various ways of reducing the maximum stresses and means of controlling the vibration are discussed, including an analysis of the action of Stockbridge dampers. Applications of the formulas to specific cases are given, and comparisons are made with experimental data from laboratory and field."
"Carrier pilot relaying has been regarded by many as the nearest approach to a perfect protective relay system; however, it has not been adopted generally because of its high cost. With the intention of making still further improvements and reducing the cost of carrier pilot systems, a careful investigation has been made. The results of the investigation are presented in this paper, and a new carrier pilot system, designed in accordance with these findings, is described."
"The theory and design of a new distance relay suitable for ground protection are described in this paper, and the results of 2 groups of extensive field tests are presented. These results demonstrate that the new relay performs in a manner that can be predicted mathematically, and that it avoids certain difficulties involved in the application of conventional distance relays to ground protection."
"Hydrogen cooled synchronous condensers now in use have a total rating of several hundred thousand kilovolt-amperes. During the last 2 years the use of hydrogen cooling has been extended to frequency converters, and most recently to turbine generators. Several such machines now are being constructed. This method of cooling not only results in a reduction of machine losses and maintenance cost, but also makes feasible the construction of units with capacities greater than those of the existing air cooled units."
"A novel circuit arrangement that supplies a large current to a circuit breaker under test and then subjects the open terminals to a high recovery voltage has been used in testing the 2,500,000-kva 287.5-kv impulse oil circuit breakers built for the Boulder Dam-Los Angeles transmission line. A description of this arrangement, which makes available several times the apparent power of the testing apparatus, is given in this paper, together with oscillograms which show details of the arc extinction process not previously known, and the results of a study of voltage distribution."
"The purpose of this paper is to present a general method of impedance calculation equally applicable to all transformer circuits and all construction types. An effort is made to show how the “circuit method” can be used and to prove some of the circuit properties and relations that are pertinent to the problems involved."
"Engineers are concerned with the preparation of young men to serve a civilization and culture based largely upon the results of technological developments. This fact makes necessary a multisided, better educated, and more roundly interested individual. Combined with the increasing body of fundamental technical knowledge and high standards of technical education, the adequacy of a 4 year professional educational program has been challenged. Opinions regarding the situation are summarized herein, together with the activities of the Engineers' Council for Professional Development, through whose united program there is hope for a fuller understanding leading to the consummation of an accepted philosophy and effective procedure."
"Linking the first studies of highway lighting with the present studies, this paper enumerates some aspects of the optical problem involved in producing satisfactory levels of brightness on typical pavements to insure adequate visibility under various weather conditions. Characteristics of incandescent, sodium vapor, and high intensity mercury vapor lamps are discussed, together with the designs of luminaires, mounting heights, and spacings necessary to provide optimum conditions for vision."
"ALL is in readiness for the 52d annual A.I.E.E. summer convention tobe held at Pasadena, Calif., June 22–26, 1936, with headquarters in the Huntington Hotel. The summer convention committee with R. W. Sorensen, chairman, has arranged an excellent program. In addition to the business features, sports, trips, and entertainment have not been overlooked. Pasadena, by virtue of its location, provides an ideal setting with the most favorable of climatic conditions and places of interest which may be visited. For a more complete account of the convention features, including both preconvention and postconvention trips, as well as transportation and hotelfacilities, see Electrical Engineering for May, pages 554–8."
"MORE than 300 members, guests, and students attended a very successful 4 day meeting of the A.I.E.E. North Eastern District held at New Haven, Conn., May 6–9, 1936. The student convention, held in conjunction with the meeting, was represented by counselors and students from the various Branches within the District. The campus of Yale University and the excellent facilities of Strathcona Hall, meeting headquarters, lent added interest and color to a program that was well arranged b y the local committee."
"A conference of Student Branches in the Institute's Southern District (Number 4) was held April 16–18, 1936, at Clemson College, S. C The Branches in the District were well represented, 142 counselors and Enrolled Students being present."
"On several occasions, educators in the field of engineering and members of engineering societies have concerned themselves with the lack of uniformity in engineering degrees and the consequent confusion arising from the various practices of engineering schools. The Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education has had 3 different committees and reports on the subject, and the Engineers' Council for Professional Development has recognized the problem in the deliberations of its committee on professional recognition."
"On Saturday, April 18, 1936, the ninth annual conference of Student Branches in the A.I.E.E. North Central District (Number 6) was held at the University of Colorado, Boulder. In conjunction with the Student Conference, a technical conference on electric power and communication problems was held on Friday, April 17, under sponsorship of the university. This was a t tended by about 190, which included most of those attending the Student Branch conference as well as many members of the Institute's Denver Section."
"HE following constitutes the annual report on Institute Section and Branch activities for th e fiscal year which ended April 30, 1936.

"ELEPHONY involves the transmission of speech to a distance by electrical means. Speech itself, physically considered, consists of rapid longitudinal variations in air pressure, or acoustic waves as they are called, traveling out from the mouth of the speaker or to the ear of the listener. Each sound has its characteristic wave form or group of wave forms and as a result these acoustic waves are of complicated and rapidly changing wave form as is illustrated by the oscillograms on Fig. 1 showing the structure of the electrical current in a telephone circuit resulting from the spoken word Harvard, and, in more detail, the vowel in “Har.” The telephonic transmission of speech requires, therefore, three fundamental elements: (a) An instrument which, when acted upon by the acoustic waves of the speaker's voice, produces in an electrical circuit oscillations or waves suitable to represent the voice of the speaker. This is the telephone transmitter."
"Analysis was beginning to take its place as an important branch of chemistry when, in 1828, Wöhler synthesized urea and the Age of Synthetic Organic Chemistry was born, destined to overshadow analysis for nearly a century. When interest in synthesis began to diminish, in the late 1800's, physical chemistry arose to intrigue the chemical mind. The analyst, thus neglected, had to work with apparatus, techniques and viewpoints evolved for other chemical purposes. In 1910 the Austrian Pregl found it necessary to analyze a sample too small for the then available technique to handle. His solution was the invention of a new kind of analysis — microanalysis, the essential features of which are: reduction of apparatus size and of scale of operations to a point commensurate with sample size; development of entirely new techniques, apparatus and chemical reactions specially suited to analysis; and inculcation in the mind of the analyst of the attitude that analytical problems are, in greater or less degree, research problems, and are to be approached as such, with a mind entirely unrestricted by chemical classicism. This article discusses the applications made by the Bell Telephone Laboratories of microanalytical and related special techniques to communication research and engineering."
"The development of a nationwide teletypewriter exchange system in the United States required the design of switchboards and signaling facilities adapted to this special service. The two types of switchboard now in use are described in this paper, and the operation of the circuits by means of which connections between the various subscribers are established and supervised by the operators is explained."
"A nationwide transmission system has been established in the United States for teletypewriter exchange service by means of which 2-way communication between teletypewriter subscribers can be established in a time comparable to that required for long distance telephone service. A brief description of the principle of operation of teletypewriters is included in this paper as an introduction to the discussion of the transmission requirements and the plan of the present system."
"Transmission of photographs over telephone wires was begun commercially several years ago, but recent improvements have increased to 11 by 17 inches the size of photograph that could be transmitted and have made it possible for the picture to give much more information. The new machines used for sending and receiving photographs are described in this paper, and the requirements and control of the wire system necessary to prevent imperfections in the picture and to permit switching of sending and receiving stations are discussed."
"It is shown that the equivalent network of negative-grid vacuum tubes both at low and at very high frequencies may be expressed in many different forms. Several are suggested and the advantages of two are described in some detail. One of these is closely analogous to that which is in general use at low frequencies and requires only the addition of resistive components in series both with the cathode-grid and the grid-plate capacitances to make it applicable to frequencies where transit time effects are appreciable though moderately small. The resistance in series with the grid-plate capacitance is negative in sign. In this form of the equivalent network, electron transit times do not introduce a phase angle into the amplification factor. The paper is divided into two parts. The first gives a descriptive interpretation of the results while the second contains the mathematical manipulations."
"In aerial line design it is advantageous to know the effect of oblique winds as well as cross winds. This paper gives the results of wind tunnel tests made on 0.104-inch and 0.165-inch diameter wires for each 10° angle of obliquity between 0° and 90° using wind velocities of 30 to 90 miles per hour in steps of 10 miles per hour. These results are then analyzed to determine (1) their compliance with the law of dynamic similarity and (2) the magnitudes of the various wind components. From these analyzed results an expression is developed for the force of oblique winds in terms of the component normal to the wires."
"This paper discusses the corrosion of cable sheathing in the aerial and underground cable plants. Corrosion does not appear to be a primary factor affecting the life of aerial cables; failure of these cables occurs usually from intergranular embrittlement and is minimized by the use of alloy sheathing. It is shown that corrosion of cable sheathing in conduit occurs by means of the operation of small corrosion cells on the surface of the sheath or by the leakage of current from the sheath to ground. The driving force of these corrosion cells arises from some chemical inhomogeneity in either the metal or the surrounding environment. The course and the character of corrosion is determined chiefly by the influence of the constituents of the environment on the operation of these cells. These constituents may be classed as corroding or protective; — the corroding including oxygen, nitrates, alkalies and organic acids, while the protective are silicates, sulfates, carbonates, soil colloids and certain organic compounds. Cable sheathing buried directly in soils is seriously corroded by differential aeration-cell action resulting from physical contact of relatively large soil particles and metal. In general it is concluded that corrosion of cable sheathing is influenced more by the nature of the environment than by the chemical composition of the metallic material. The incidence of corrosion of cable sheathing is small owing to the maintenance of non-corrosive chemical and electrical environments in the cable plant."
"THE three principal sources of airplane noise are the engine, the propeller, and air turbulence. Because of the impossibility of generating each kind of noise separately from the others, it has been necessary to develop what are in effect means for separating them and studying each one independently as they vary with speed of ship, speed of engine, and horsepower. In brief, the method that was used employs a series of tests under various flight conditions, the resulting data making it possible to solve a set of simultaneous equations. The paper gives numerous curves showing the variation with engine speed of the noise from these three sources."
"The Renaissance of Physics.1 Karl K. Darrow. Intended for the general public, this book is chiefly a story of some of the great discoveries and some of the grand general principles achieved or confirmed in physics since the century began. The title is an allusion to this period, for, to quote from the beginning of the book: “ever since the turn of the century physics has been enjoying a veritable renaissance, fairly to be likened with that splendid flowering of the arts and humane letters four hundred years ago to which the name of Renaissance was first applied. In this contemporary age when the artists in so many fields are overshadowed by the work of masters long since dead, the physicist has had the glorious good fortune of sharing in a spirit, an ambition, a sense of novelty and limitless opportunity, such as (we are told) inspired the Elizabethans.”"

American Telephone and Telegraph Company, Department of Operation and Engineering, 1920–. Mr. Bemis has been engaged in work on carrier telephone systems, program transmission and public address systems, inductive coordination of power and telephone lines and since 1932 on telegraph engineering with particular reference to its transmission features."
"The variations in long-wave radio field strength near the time of sunset on long transmission paths, which have been reported by many observers, were studied for the purpose of formulating rational methods of forecasting their time of occurrence. During some preliminary observations fair agreement was found between the time of minimum field and the sun's position relative to a particular point on the transatlantic path under observation. The more extended study of radio field variations during sunset periods and solar eclipses disclosed that in general no exact relationship could be established between the sun's position at any point and the occurrence of the minimum field. Observations of field variations were made on radio signals at a number of different frequencies and over several paths. It was concluded that a characteristic sunset cycle of field variations is present on frequencies between 18 kc. and 68 kc. for transmission paths longer than 700 km. For paths less than 200 km. long, such variations are negligible. There is some evidence that the amplitude of these field variations is smaller at lower frequencies. Analysis of the data presented indicates that long waves over long paths are transmitted predominately by “sky waves.” From the data it was not possible to establish any satisfactory picture of the path followed. It was established, however, that empirical methods based on observations over a particular transmission path may be employed to forecast the approximate time of occurrence of field variations."
"This paper outlines the application of electrochemical methods to corrosion investigations. It discusses the position of the potential of a metal against its environment and the trend of this potential with time, pointing out that it is thereby possible to determine whether the corrosion process is controlled by reactions occurring at the anodic areas, the cathodic areas, or both; that is, whether there is a tendency toward passivity, inhibition or progressive attack. Measurements of film stability whether in terms of the leakage current which may be passed through the film or in terms of the amount of film forming material required to produce passivity or the amount of film destroying material required to render a metal active, furnish information as to the quality of corrosion resistant films. Measurements of the rate at which a film forms on a metal when placed in a film-forming environment throws light on its relative surface reactivity, and such information is of assistance in determining the rate of corrosion in homogeneous corrosive environments or the rate of passivation in the film-forming environments. On the basis of such measurements and with a chemical knowledge of the environments in which metals are used as well as the composition and physical state or structure of the metals, it is possible to predict corrosion behavior and to obtain an understanding of corrosion problems usually not possible by ordinary empirical corrosion tests."
"A resumé is given of the basic relations between the magnetic characteristics of the core of a coil and the inductance and resistance of the coil as measured on an alternating current bridge. Modifications of the simple relations to take account of the interactions of eddy currents and hysteresis in the core material are developed, and are seen to require a more complicated interpretation of the data in order to obtain an accurate separation of the eddy current, hysteresis, and “residual” losses. Means are described of minimizing or eliminating the disturbing effects of distributed capacitance, leakance and eddy current loss in the coil windings. Essential details of the alternating current bridge and associated apparatus, and of the core structure, are given."
"DISCOVERY of the loadstone and some of its magnetic properties is now reputed to be some three thousand years old. During these many years ferromagnetism has resisted very successfully the attack of theorists, and even at the present time theory lags far behind experiment. But advances in theory have been particularly rapid during the last five or ten years; the author describes in this paper what he regards as the high points of this progress."
"After a review of the general aspects of the classical electromagnetic theory several “equivalence” theorems are established and illustrated with a number of examples from the diffraction theory. Then follows a discussion of possible applications of these theorems to radiation problems. The latter part of the paper is devoted to the calculation of the power radiated from an open end of a coaxial pair."
"The unexpected magnetic properties of certain alloys of iron and nickel discovered some 20 years ago led to a thorough study of the entire range of iron-nickel alloys. The results of this study were so encouraging that alloys of these metals with cobalt, the only other ferromagnetic metal, also were studied, as well as various alloys of these metals with small amounts of non-magnetic metals added. From the results of this extended investigation have emerged several alloys that are playing important parts in the continued advancement of electrical communication."
"The rapidly advancing art of electrical communication and the increasingly wide variety of its applications have required marked improvements in the transformers used in communication circuits. These improvements, achieved partly through advances in design and partly through improvements in the constituent materials, are discussed in this paper."
"IN studies of the inductive coordination of power and telephone systems from the noise standpoint, a knowledge of the magnitudes of the harmonic currents and voltages on the power circuits and of the harmonic components of the telephone circuit noise is necessary. It is also necessary that there be available a means of rating and summing up these individual components to give an overall indication of their effects on a person using a telephone connected to one of the exposed circuits. This paper discusses methods which have been developed for making such overall measurements."
"DAILY character figure for radio transmission is obtained from the data of the short-wave transatlantic telephone circuits of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. The New York-London circuits are in practically continual use so that they furnish data from which a character figure, representative of the whole 24 hours, may be derived. Such figures are based on the ratio of uncommercial to total time and thus are indirectly dependent on field strengths."
"It is concluded from measurements of virtual heights and critical ionization frequencies of the various regions of the ionosphere which were made during two solar eclipses at Deal, New Jersey, that ultra-violet light is an important ionizing agency in the E, M, F1, and F2 regions."
"N connection with inductive coordination problems it is frequently necessary to estimate low-frequency ground-return mutual impedances between power and communication lines. The distribution of currents in the earth is a major factor in the determination of these impedances. This distribution is controlled by the resistivities of the component parts of the earth's crust and the arrangement of these parts. In impedance formulas that are customarily used the effect of the earth is taken care of by the inclusion of a single parameter — the earth resistivity. For a homogeneous earth this would be the actual resistivity of the material composing it. But the crust is nowhere homogeneous; hence, the resistivity used in such formulas is always of the nature of an average of the resistivities of the several parts of the crust — it is termed the effective earth resistivity."
"Heat Treatment of Magnetic Materials in a Magnetic Field — II. Experiments with Two Alloys.1 Richard M. Bozorth and Joy F. Dillinger. The magnetization of two alloys, as affected by heat treatment in a magnetic field at various temperatures, is examined in some detail in order to elucidate the nature of the accompanying changes which result in some cases in a 30-fold increase in maximum permeability. The experiments show that these alloys (one containing approximately 35 per cent iron and 65 per cent nickel, the other 20 per cent iron, 60 per cent cobalt and 20 per cent nickel) can be effectively heat treated in a magnetic field of 10 oersteds if the temperature is above 400° C. and below the Curie point of the alloy. The time during which the magnetic properties change has been measured at different temperatures and is found to vary according to the equation r = Aew/kT. The experiments are interpreted in terms of the domain theory of ferromagnetism. The changes which occur are due to the relief of magnetostrictive stresses which arise when the material becomes ferromagnetic upon cooling through the Curie point or when an external magnetic field is applied, and the relief comes about by plastic flow or diffusion in the separate domains. The values of A (about 10–12 second) and W (2.1 electron volts) are the same as those determined by Bragg and Williams for the above equation which also gives the time necessary for the establishment of a superstructure in alloys. The relation between the two processes, establishment of superstructure and the relief of magnetostrictive strains, is pointed out."

A., 1918–19; Assistant Professor of Physics, University of Kansas, 1921–22. American Telephone and Telegraph Company, Department of Development and Research, 1922–34; Bell Telephone Laboratories, 1934–. Dr. Bailey's work has been largely along the line of methods for making radio transmission measurements and of long-wave radio problems."
"From empirical measurements of noise-to-signal ratio made during the routine operation of short-wave radio telephone circuits there is obtained a general relation between percentage lost circuit time and transmission improvement in decibels. In this relation “percentage lost circuit time” is the percentage of time that the noise-to-signal ratio is considered unsatisfactory. No attempt is made to define such a standard quantitatively. If, from past experience with a long-range, short-wave telephone, telegraph or broadcast circuit, it is known that the circuit is unsatisfactory a certain percentage of the time, the above-mentioned relation may be used to estimate the effect of transmission improvement upon this percentage of unsatisfactory or lost time. For a given circuit the variation in percentage lost circuit time, as the standard for the tolerable service is changed by a given number of decibels, may also be estimated. There are included estimates of the relation between the number of lost time intervals of various lengths and transmission improvement."
"Voltage fluctuations which occur in resistance elements of the granular type when a direct current is flowing have been measured in the granular carbon microphone, commercial grid leaks, and sputtered or evaporated metal films. The results can be experessed by the formula $\\overline{V_c^2} = KV^\\alpha R^\\beta \\log (F_2/F_1),$ where $\\overline{V_c^2}$ is the mean square fluctuation voltage, V is the d.-c. voltage across the resistance R, α and β are constants having values of about 1.85 and 1.25, respectively, and F2 and F1 are the limits of the frequency range over which the fluctuation voltage is measured. The constant K depends, among other things on the temperature, the surrounding medium, and the dimensions and material of the resistance element; for a commonly used carbon transmitter at ordinary operating conditions its value is about 1.3 × 10−11. The spontaneous voltage fluctuations and the signal due to acoustic modulation are affected in almost an equivalent manner by the applied d.-c. voltage which suggests that the two effects arise from the same type of mechanism, namely a fluctuating resistance at the points of contact between granules. Experiment shows that although the acoustic signal produces a resistance modulation which is in phase at all contacts the spontaneous resistance fluctuations are completely random. On the assumption that a region of secondary conduction, wherein the resistance fluctuation lies, surrounds each area of primary conduction as postulated in recent contact theory a value of β consistent with experiment has been deduced. On the further assumptions that thermal energy produces the mechanical fluctuations and that the equipartition law governs the distribution of energy between oscillators the observed frequency distribution follows."
"The topic of this article is the explanation of magnetism as ordinarily observed — to wit, the magnetization of pieces of matter of ordinary dimensions — by ascribing magnetic moment to the individual molecules, atoms, and electrons of which matter is composed. For paramagnetic bodies it is postulated that the individual atoms are magnets of which the orientation, but not the strength, is altered in the presence of a magnetic field; the theory is so successful as to make it possible to calculate, from magnetization-curves, values for the magnetic moments of these atoms which agree admirably with those deduced from spectroscopic theory and from experiments of other types. For ferromagnetic bodies the same postulate is made, but it is necessary in addition to recognize the existence of huge interatomic forces of which very little is known, so that a large proportion of the science of ferromagnetism still lies beyond the scope of atomic theory. For diamagnetic bodies the phenomena are interpreted in a simple and effective manner, as an immediate corollary of the well-known structure of the atom."
"For given conditions of design there exists an optimum proportioning or configuration which makes the high-frequency attenuation of a given type of individually shielded circuit a minimum. Determination is made of such optimum proportioning for a wide variety of types of individually shielded circuits including several novel types designed to make the high-frequency attenuation low in comparison with the cross-sectional area occupied by the circuit, and the attenuation of different types is compared. The following topics and specific circuit structures are considered: Coaxial Circuits — Basic Coaxial Circuit; Effect of Dielectric; Effect of Frequency on Optimum Ratio; Thin Walls; Stranded Conductors; Optimum Proportioning as a Function of Conductor Resistance. Balanced Shielded Circuits — Shielded Pair (Cylindrical Conductors and Shield) — Condition for Minimum Attenuation, Condition for Maximum Characteristic Impedance, Effect of Dielectric, Effect of Frequency; Pair in Space; Shielded Stranded Pair; Pair with Shield Return; Double Coaxial Circuit; Shielded Pair (Round Conductors and Oval Shield); Shielded Pair (Quasi-Elliptical Conductors); Shielded Quad."
"A peculiar form of electrical propagation is described below. It makes use of extremely high frequencies — even beyond those generally employed in radio. In some respects it resembles ordinary wire transmission but unlike the latter there are no return conductors, at least of the usual kind. In this transmission, electromagnetic waves are sent through guides made up either of an insulator alone or of an insulator surrounded by a conductor. In a special case this insulator may be air. There are at least four different types of waves or electrical configurations that may be propagated. One of them is such that theory indicates its attenuation through a hollow conductor continuously decreases with increase of frequency. Although the paper deals largely with the nature of this transmission, some of the fundamental pieces of apparatus used in experimental work are described. They include generators, receivers and wave-meters."
"Following a brief historical sketch, this paper deals with the mathematical theory of wave transmission in two novel kinds of cylindrical wave guides of circular cross section; namely, the hollow conductor and the dielectric wire. These transmission systems behave as high pass filters with exceedingly high critical frequencies. The attenuation and impedance characteristics of the hollow conductor, heretofore ignored as far as the writers are aware, are given especial attention. This investigation discloses the remarkable fact that there exists in this system one and only one type of wave, the attenuation of which decreases with increasing frequency, a characteristic which attaches to no other type of guided wave known to the writers."
"The appearance of an electromotive force at the terminals of a vibrating rod or wire of magnetic material was investigated. It was concluded from experiments somewhat more simple and direct than those employed by other investigators that the effect was due to changes in the state of circular magnetization accompanying the variations of stress. The results suggested problems for more intensive investigation and applications of possible practical value."
"THE Heaviside operational calculus postulates at the outset that the initial (boundary) conditions at reference time t = 0 are those of equilibrium; that is to say, the system is at rest when suddenly energized at time t = 0 by a “unit” impressed force. By unit impressed force is to be understood a force which is zero before, unity after, time t = 0."
"HE value of paints for the protection of metal surfaces depends upon their effectiveness as physical barriers against the corrosive elements of the surrounding environment and upon the electrochemical activity of the primer pigments in rendering the surfaces passive. Physical testing methods have been developed which furnish valuable information concerning the quality and rate of aging of paint films.1 There is, however, an obvious need for direct methods of determining the condition and behavior of the metal surface beneath the paint film, the rate of penetration of corrosive agents through the film, and the mechanism of the inhibitive action afforded by the film. The present paper describes an electrochemical method of obtaining this information."
"The Orientation of Crystals in Silicon Iron.1 Richard M. Bozorth. X-ray examination of silicon iron prepared by N. P. Goss shows that the component crystals are oriented so that a [001] direction is parallel to the direction of rolling and a (110) plane lies in the rolling plane. This is contrary to the result reported by Goss in his paper „New Development in Electrical Strip Steels Characterized by Fine Grain Structure Approaching the Properties of a Single Crystal,„ published in Transactions of the American Society for Metals, Volume 23, June, 1935, page 511. The differences in the magnetic properties in different directions in the sheet are explained in terms of the properties of the single crystals."

Army, 1918–19. Research chemist, Barrett Company, 1921–22. Western Electric Company, 1922–25. Bell Telephone Laboratories, 1925– Assistant Chemical Director, 1931–. Dr. Burns' work has been largely in the electrochemical field and particularly on the subject of the corrosion of metals and its prevention."
"Among the wide variety of practical and theoretical problems confronting the telephone engineer, there is a surprisingly large number to whose solution mathematics has made notable contribution. In his kit of mathematical tools the theory of probability is a frequently used and most effective instrument. This theory of probability contains a large number of theorems, a large number of functions, which permit of application to telephony. Among these is a particular tool, a particular group of mathematical functions known as the “Hermitian Functions,” each of which is identified by a number called its “order.” These mathematical functions or relations have no practical utility until the variables in the equation can be assigned numerical values and the resultant numerical value of the function calculated. Tables of the numerical values of Hermitian functions of low order exist; for example, Glover's Tables of Applied Mathematics cover the ground for those of the first eight orders. But tables for the functions of higher order are still a desideratum. This paper presents an expansion by means of which the evaluation of a high order function can be readily accomplished with a considerable degree of accuracy. The development of the expansion is prefaced by some remarks on the early history of the Hermitian functions and the relation of this history to modern theoretical physics."
"Poor penetration of the non-durable sapwood is the most important factor in the decay of creosoted southern pine poles. Over 3000 such poles that had been treated with coal tar creosotes of varying types at thirteen creosoting plants in the South have been critically inspected to determine when and where decay started. The poles had been in line from five to twenty-six years under widely diverse climatic conditions in scattered localities east of the Mississippi River. Ninety-five per cent of the failures were poles in which the creosote had penetrated less than 1.8 inches and 60 percent of the sapwood thickness. No failures were found in poles that had been penetrated more than 2.1 inches and 75 per cent of the sapwood thickness. The current Bell System treating specifications require a penetration of 2.5 inches or 85 per cent of the sapwood thickness. The hazard of failure by decay during the ordinary service life of a line is reduced to a practical minimum in poles produced under these specifications."
"Tandem operation is becoming of increasing importance in the Bell System. The operating and service features of the different types, and the conditions under which each type is used, are outlined. Charts are included showing, schematically, typical trunking arrangements in the various systems. The increasing use of tandem operation on traffic handled at toll boards is discussed."
"A moving coil microphone is described which responds uniformly over a wide frequency range to sound arriving from any direction. A study of diffraction, the main factor causing directivity of microphones of the pressure type, leads to the conclusion that a small spherical shape is the most desirable for a non-directional microphone. But even fulfilling this requirement in the design of the housing leaves a large directional effect. Hence an acoustic screen has been developed which diminishes diffraction to an extent necessary to make the change in response due to angle of sound incidence imperceptible to the ear. The non-directional microphone is of simple and rugged construction. Adequate precautions have been taken to prevent atmospheric changes from affecting the stability. The small size and unusual shape of the microphone contribute much to its attractive appearance."
"A theoretical study is presented of the properties of a condenser, one plate of which is free to vibrate, when it is included in a circuit containing a generator, the frequency of which is higher than the resonant frequency of the plate and unrelated thereto. It is shown that the plate may be maintained in oscillation at a frequency at or near its mechanical resonance, at the expense of the energy supplied by the generator, provided certain conditions are satisfied. The most favorable condition is one in which the plate is resonant at the frequency of its vibration and the electric circuit is resonant at that of the generator, and at the difference between the generator and plate frequencies, and is anti-resonant at their sum. Under these conditions the generator voltage must exceed a threshold value determined by the impedances and frequencies. This threshold voltage increases as the conditions become less favorable. Expressions are given for the values of the oscillations as functions of the voltage when the threshold is exceeded. When the sum frequency is absent, the energies dissipated at the plate and difference frequencies are in the ratio of the two frequencies. The oscillations described represent a special case of a class of similar oscillations, all of which depend on the presence of a non-linear reactance. Another special case is a molecular model capable of reproducing the main features of the Raman effect."
"Experimental results are given on an oscillating electromechanical system in which, under a single frequency impressed electromotive force, mechanical vibrations are sustained at a frequency near the resonant frequency of the mechanical system and electrical oscillations at the difference between the frequency of the mechanical vibration and that of the impressed force. The system is the one studied analytically by R. V. L. Hartley in an accompanying paper. Its performance conforms to the principal operating features predicted in his analysis."
"A new type of telephone line is described in which a specially insulated twin wire is plowed into the soil. Problems of wire design, splicing and maintenance are discussed and transmission characteristics are given."
"AS a basis for the development of protective measures and practices, knowledge of the limits of dangerous electric shock is obviously important and this joint investigation at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University was initiated in the hope of obtaining some of the needed data. In seeking a value of current which if exceeded would be dangerous to man, it is important to consider for different practical conditions the effects which are brought about as the current is increased. The threshold of sensation is reached at about one milliampere for a frequency of 60 cycles. Other investigators have found that at about 15 milliamperes from hand to hand the subject becomes unable to control the muscles subjected to stimulation."
"HE use of increasingly higher power levels in broadcasting in the last few years has attached new importance to the matter of more efficient operation of the high-power stages in radio transmitters. The resulting reductions in cost of power, size of high-voltage transformers and rectifier, and water cooling requirements, are of particular importance in transmitters having outputs of 50 kilowatts or more."

Some of the requisites for attaining a harmonious blend of all the cinematic powers and possibilities, and the differences between mere stage productions and motion picture productions are pointed out."
"A brief description of the application of motion pictures to the study of the motions of operatives in factories, etc. Eight-mm. film is used, and means are provided for studying and analyzing the motions either at various speeds of projection or frame by frame."
"The Projection Screen Brightness Committee was organized to prepare for the Standards Committee a recommendation of theater screen brightness. Compared to the multiplicity of problems confronting other committees of the Society, the single task of this Committee may appear simple. However, the problem is very complex, and its solution involves an attack based upon a knowledge of several different branches of optical science, principal among which divers fields are photometry, physiological optics, geometrical optics, and photography."
"The known facts, as reported in the literature, regarding the visual functions, so far as they are influenced by the brightness of the projection screen and its surroundings in the motion picture theater, are reported. The elements of major importance in the visibility of objects are (1) the angular size of the detail to be discriminated; (2) the contrast or degree of difference of brightness between an object and its background; (3) the intensity of illumination; and (4) the exposure time. — When viewing a motion picture, the projection screen and its environment constitute the visual field, and the perception of detail in the projected picture is the visual task that the eye is called upon to perform. Since we are primarily concerned with perception, the most important of the visual functions are the perceptual ones, which are: (1) the least amount of light that the eye can perceive, or its threshold sensitivity; (2) its ability to distinguish differences in brightness, or contrast sensitivity; (3) the perception of form, or visual acuity; (4) and the speed of vision. Each of these functions is discussed, together with the effect upon them of the external factors with which they are correlated."
"An account is given of an experimental device by means of which an observer is enabled to control and select the brightness at which he wishes pictures to be projected. Data are given for the selections of thirteen individuals on five typical motion picture prints. It is concluded that (1) the average selected brightness is about 30 foot-lamberts; (2) individual observers differ by a factor of 3; (3) a border brightness of 0.05 foot-lambert is preferable to a dark border."
"Two fundamental factors determine the light output of the motion picture projector: (1) source brightness and (2) the effective aperture of the projection optical system. When these are known accurately, the number of lumens available for screen illumination can be computed, after making allowances for losses that occur in the collective element, the shutter, and the objective lens. The method of computation is described, and results are given for typical projectors. It should be noted, however, that adjustments are made in the practical operation of projectors that can produce wide variations in the two fundamental factors. Therefore, the conditions of operation must be precisely known in order to apply the results to any particular installation. — Screen brightness can be derived directly from the lumen output when the screen factors—area, reflectivity, and directional properties—are considered."
"During the past twenty years much information on theater and screen illumination has been accumulated. The significance and reliability of these data are discussed in the light of known physical factors influencing proper illumination. As a first approximation to a standard, it is suggested that the data indicate a value of 8 to 12 foot-candles as representing satisfactory illumination. Variation of required illumination with screen size is analyzed, and a solution of the problem is suggested. The brightness of screen surroundings also is discussed. It is concluded that improvement in projection may be made by stricter application of existing information but that further investigations are desirable."
"Data regarding certain transmission characteristics of release prints are necessary to the work of the Projection Screen Brightness Committee. This paper lists the results of such measurements without detailed discussion of their significance. The apparatus used is fully described."
"A general discussion of the subject of photometry and methods of measuring brightness. Descriptions are given of the apparatus and methods used in measuring luminous intensity, luminous flux, transmission and absorption, and brightness. In an appendix are listed definitions of the various units and terms involved in photometry and the measurement of the various photometric quantities."
"The importance of screen brightness as compared to auditorium brightness is referred to. Various methods of measuring and determining the brightness and reflectance of screens are reviewed. A new photoelectric illumination meter is described which should simplify the procedure of making screen measurements."
"The motion picture on the screen is discussed as a visual task, and its lighting and that of its environs is approached in the manner recommended by the authors for all lighting problems. After choosing the proper quality of light and having a screen brightness as great as is practicable, the problem becomes chiefly one of quality of lighting or distribution of brightness in the visual fields. Various aspects of visibility and psychophysiological effects of seeing are discussed. The problem is subdivided into two parts: (1) The attainment of maximal visibility within the central field (the motion picture on the screen) without regard to the surroundings; and (2) the illumination of the surroundings in such a manner as to produce maximal comfort and minimal loss of visibility. — The problem is unravelled from the usual entanglement of physiological optics, much of which is largely of academic interest rather than of practical importance. It is shown to be one of lighting to be guided by the same concepts, principles, and knowledge embodied in the science of seeing as are other lighting problems. Suggestions are made for practical studies of the possibilities of evolving the lighting of the motion picture screen and its environs from its present primitive stage of purely localized lighting, which is generally undesirable."
"Lack of adequate volume range is one of the greatest handicaps to achieving greater realism in sound motion pictures. A method of intercutting variable-density and variable-width recordings is described which results in an 8-db. increase in effective volume range."
"Many methods have been applied recently for increasing the volume range of recordings. Some, such as the push-pull system, require mechanical and electrical modification of existing apparatus in order to utilize their advantages. In an effort to produce prints capable of standard reproduction, with increased signal-to-noise ratio, the mechanical reversed-bias method has been used at the Twentieth Century-Fox Film Studios. Briefly, it is a method of reverse-biasing a valve so that the valve aperture is increased by the biasing current to a degree sufficient to prevent clash. Further modification provides for a combination of standard biasing up to a certain percentage of modulation and mechanical reverse-biasing from that point on, resulting in an increase of 8 to 12 decibels over the usual methods in signal-to-noise ratio."
"The shape of the motion picture theater should be determined both in the horizontal and vertical sense, chiefly by certain basic factors of the physiology of the eye and the laws of visual reception. Recognition of these factors in designing the theater produces a theater form of minimal depth, concentrating the seating as much as possible with the vertical dimension. Visual acuity and the subtended angles of the viewed image are analyzed as they affect the theater form."
"Various methods of eliminating splice noise in sound-films are discussed. A new machine is described that operates upon the punch-press principle, utilizing an opaque cellulose acetate adhesive tape to mask out sound splices."
"The acoustic characteristics of a room can in great part be evaluated from a knowledge of the rate with which sound in the room dies down when emission from the source ceases. The physical principles underlying the relationship are briefly discussed. It is shown by specific examples that we can obtain valuable additional information about acoustics of a room by recording the sound level at one or more points in the room when the frequency of the sound is continuously varied."
"An outline of the problems encountered in theaters following the installation of sound equipment, and the determination of standards of performance. The methods and value of gathering experimental data on the operation of equipment in the field, both for servicing and laboratory practice, are discussed, as well as the effects of variations in recording and in the tastes of the public, both from the exhibitors' and the public's point of view, and the effect of intelligent servicing upon the box-office."
"The principles of producing “Visual Accompaniments” to musical renditions for the theater are briefly described, as follows; (1) natural scenes for portraying the “musical mood” of the musical composition; (2) the changing and blending of beautiful paintings to interpret the mood, known as the Savage Method; and (3) the use of abstract color forms as a means of interpretation. The technic followed in applying the two latter methods is described in detail."
"An outline of the use and production of educational motion pictures in the United States Army, together with a discussion of their use in conjunction with the “Applicatory Method” of instruction."
"An outline of the extensive aerial motion picture activity now being carried out in the departments of the Army Air Corps. The relation between the various Air Corps units is explained, and the many uses to which motion pictures are put in instruction and training, technical studies, maintenance and inspection of aircraft, etc., are described. — Slow-motion pictures have proved very valuable for investigating the causes and progress of fire in airplanes, the operation of parachutes, the effectiveness of demolition of bombing, etc. Lectures recorded with the pictures explain the operations of blind flying, loading bombing racks, releasing bombs, and the like. Motion pictures of vast territories are taken quickly by planes flying en masse."
"In discussing the use of a photocell for the measurement of diffuse density, the importance of the optical characteristics of the cell as a part of the optical system of the densitometer is emphasized. Data showing some of the discrepancies in density measurement resulting from these optical characteristics are given. It is shown that for two extreme types of emulsion, the measurement of diffuse density is possible with certain arrangements of the optical system."
"Current practices and equipment in use in the motion picture processing laboratories of Great Britain are described under the headings: Picture Negative Development, Positive Development, Development of Sound-Track Negative, Developing Equipment, and Printing."
"A new 13.6-mm. super-high-intensity carbon is described which will burn at currents as high as 190 amperes and which has a higher intrinsic brilliancy and a more uniform distribution of light across the crater face than the regular 13.6-mm. carbon rated at 120 to 130 amperes. — Tests comparing the light projected upon a projection screen by this new carbon and by the regular carbon show conclusively that the available light has been increased by at least 30 per cent. The arc lamp used with the carbons must be properly designed to take care of the increased current and carbon consumption."
"The present trend in the motion picture industry is toward more extensive use of the high-intensity carbon arc in both the theater and the studio. From the earliest days, progress in the industry has been attended by constant demands for more light and for light of better quality. The high-intensity arc is the most effective means of satisfying these demands, and promises in a short time to dominate the field of theater projection and to extend its field of application in studio lighting."
"The advantages of concentrating the source of gas-filled incandescent lamps are discussed, and the various forms available and their application to optical systems and reflectors are shown. — Data regarding the temperature (color and maximum) of the various types of lamps are presented, and the similarity of the radiation of incandescent lamps to that of a Planckian radiator of suitable temperature is indicated. Curves showing the amount of light emitted at various wavelengths or colors for all lamps of interest to the motion picture industry are presented, in terms of both equal visual output and equal wattage. A discussion of the energy in the ultraviolet region and the effect of glass bulbs and lenses concludes the paper."
"Sound insulated stages are required for the production of sound pictures. Stages required to house a number of sets should be made acoustically dead. Stages consisting of only one set, such as scoring stages used for recording music, should have acoustical characteristics comparable to those of the concert hall. — A scoring stage should not only have the proper reverberation time-frequency characteristic but, in addition, the wall and ceiling surfaces should be broken up in order to diffuse the sound. Measurements made on a stage where sound reflection from the floor was not prevented indicated the effect upon the frequency characteristic of a prominent first reflection. — The use of more than one microphone for pick-up may lead to difficulties comparable to those experienced with stages having prominent reflection. Characteristic charts showing these effects are discussed in the paper. Rules, based upon the preliminary experimental work described, are given for avoiding poor quality where it is deemed necessary to use more than one microphone for pick-up."
"Directivity has been found to be desirable in sound-collecting systems to improve the ratio of direct to generally reflected sounds and otherwise to discriminate against undesirable sounds. The bidirectional ribbon microphone is a pressure-gradient instrument, in which the response corresponds to the velocity component in a sound-wave. The pressure ribbon microphone is resistance controlled, and the response is a measure of the pressure component in a sound-wave. Combination of the outputs of the pressure and velocity ribbon microphones produces a unidirectional characteristic. This microphone has been found to be useful in sound motion picture recording, radio broadcasting, and sound reinforcing systems in which the desired sounds originate in front and the undesired sounds to the rear of the microphone."
"Wave-form distortion in variable-density records caused by improper track processing and the ribbon velocity effect of the light-valve is considered from both theoretical and experimental standpoints. General agreement between calculated and experimental values of second-harmonic distortion is attained. Observed values of third-harmonic distortion are considerably greater than those predicted by the theory. Data obtained indicate that rather high values of distortion may result due to non-linearity of the relation between negative track exposure and print transmission."
"Experiments conducted for the purpose of achieving stereoscopic effects upon the screen are based upon projecting the stereoscopic pairs to the screen through red and green fillers such that equal quantities of energy will be transmitted to the eyes of the observer, which are fitted with spectacles of the two colors. It is stated that this means avoids the eye-strain attendant upon other methods."
"The construction and theory of operation are described of the electron-image tube, which consists of a photosensitive cathode, a fluorescent screen, and an electron optical system which focuses the electron “image” from the cathode upon the viewing screen. Due to the wide spectral response of the cathode, the tube can be used to convert infrared, visible, or ultraviolet images into visible images upon the fluorescent screen. — The electron optical system is discussed and its analogy to the conventional optical system is shown. To reproduce an image faithfully the electron “lens” system must be corrected for various aberrations. Methods of making these corrections are indicated, and applications of the device are described."
"The application of the copper-oxide rectifier as a d-c. power supply for projection is by no means new. A fan-cooled type of copper-oxide rectifier was developed by the General Electric Co. in 1930, and applied successfully to the low-intensity type of lamp as well as the Hi-lo lamp.1 With the advent of the Suprex type of arc an entirely new field has been opened up. The characteristics of the copper-oxide rectifier have been found to be admirably well adapted to the special voltage and current requirements of the Suprex arc and in this service it is rapidly supplanting other types of equipment."
"During the Conventions of the Society, symposiums on new motion picture apparatus are held, in which various manufacturers of equipment describe and demonstrate their new products and developments. Some of this equipment is described in the following pages; the remainder will be published in subsequent issues of the Journal."
"A historical account of the development of the cinematograph camera and projector. Work on the apparatus was begun in 1894, and a private demonstration given in March, 1895, at Paris. The first public showing at which admission was charged took place in the Grand Café on the Boulevard des Capucines, Paris, on December 28, 1895. Motion pictures were also projected upon a screen approximately 80 × 100 feet in the Galerie des Machines at the Paris Exposition grounds in 1898, using a projection distance of more than 600 feet. The paper contains an illustrated description of the apparatus."
"A brief discussion of the attitude of the musician toward the recent development of electrical and other methods of reproducing sound. After alluding to the advances made in improving the quality of reproduction, the value of recording equipment to the musical student is referred to, followed by a brief discussion of the economic disturbances produced in the musical field by the scientific innovations. The paper discusses the subject with regard to both radio broadcasting and sound motion pictures."
"The hazards in handling or storing cellulose nitrate motion picture film are due to the unusually low temperature of ignition of the film, the extremely rapid rate of combustion, and the possibility of its decomposing (exothermic) even in a restricted supply of air (oxygen), with the evolution of explosive and poisonous gases. Data and information in respect to these hazardous properties of cellulose nitrate film are given. The importance of complying with the regulations of the National Board of Fire Underwriters can not be overestimated in obtaining adequate provision for handling and storing film safely. — Film having a cellulose acetate base was first submitted to the Laboratories about 20 years ago, and as the result of an extensive investigation, the acetate-base film in the form of ribbon for motion pictures was listed as slow-burning, the fire hazard being somewhat less than that of common newsprint paper in the same form and quantity. Data in respect to the hazardous properties of slow-burning cellulose acetate film are given, together with a brief description of tests conducted on slow-burning films at Underwriters' Laboratories."
"After pointing out briefly the functions of the Conservation Department of the Motion Picture Producers & Distributors of America, Inc., in relation to the fire hazards in the motion picture industry, a résumé is given showing the exceptional record of the industry with regard to film fires since 1928, despite the inflammable nature of the materials used by the industry. — The various types of fire extinguishers and other fire fighting equipment in use are described and their most suitable applications explained. Methods of preventing and fighting fires in studios, laboratories, exchanges, and theaters are discussed at some length."
"The stability of the cellulose acetate or safety type of film was studied in comparison with the cellulose nitrate or theater type of motion picture film. The study consisted in determining the resistance of films to various accelerated aging treatments, including oven-aging in dry air, aging in steam chest, and oven-aging at high humidity. The most satisfactory aging test was the oven-aging test commonly employed to determine the stability of paper. Effects of oven-aging upon the different types of film were determined by measuring the changes in physical and chemical properties after aging. In all tests, the acetate type showed much greater resistance to deterioration than did the nitrate film. The results indicate that the acetate film is a very stable material, being comparable to permanent-record paper in its resistance to accelerated aging. The nitrate type of film was found to be comparatively unstable. — The physical properties discussed in the paper include (1) folding endurance, and (2) loss of weight. Of the chemical properties, the following are discussed: (1) acidity, (2) stability test of nitrate film, (3) copper number, (4) viscosity, and (5) the effects of aging upon gelatin emulsion. A foreword by John G. Bradley, of the Division of Motion Pictures and Sound Recordings, National Archives, introduces the paper."
"The stability of cellulose acetate film used as slide-films is being studied to determine its suitability for preserving records in libraries. Cellulose nitrate motion picture films are being tested to find the best conditions for preserving this type of film. The control of moisture content is essential to prevent brittleness in acetate films, and scratching of the emulsion appears to be a problem involved in the use of slide-films in reading projectors. Frequent cleaning is important. Nitrate motion picture films are not permanent because the cellulose nitrate is unstable. They can be best preserved by storing in a dry atmosphere, at low temperature, in such manner that products of decomposition are permitted to escape freely. The storage of nitrate films requires very exacting fire prevention measures."
"The invention of flexible film and Mazda light made possible slide-films having great advantages as to convenience and cost. The necessity of a fixed series of slides introduces problems that have net yet been recognized in the production of much of the material now available, and definite principles should govern the production of slide-film sequences. — The many advantages are as yet little known. Their convenience and negligible cost make their wider use desirable. At least three machines, adapted for this kind of slide, will soon be available. — Most film stereopticon positives now used in educational work are single-frame. The double-frame positive has some inherent elements of superiority, and there is a great advantage in that equipment is available for its production by any advanced amateur. Slide-films are the least expensive and most convenient of all devices for visual teaching by light projection, and open a broad field for important development."
"During the early part of last year, the Carnegie Foundation donated five thousand dollars for the purpose of studying methods of preserving film records. It was stipulated that this money was to be administered under an advisory committee named by the National Research Council, and that the study should be conducted at the National Bureau of Standards."
"The resolution of sound-film records has been increased by the use of ultraviolet light in recording and printing. Because of the absorption characteristics of the emulsion, exposures made by ultraviolet light are restricted to the surface. This reduces spreading of the image. The fogging of the track that usually results from halation and reflection from objects in the path of the light is almost entirely eliminated. Since the light-energy is restricted by means of a filter to a very narrow band, chromatic aberration of the lenses is reduced. — The definition of the very fine recording light-beam is limited by diffraction. This limitation is materially decreased as a result of the decrease in wavelength of the radiant energy."
"Certain considerations in the design and production of theater amplifiers are of primary importance to the reliability and performance of the equipment in service. These comprise, in general, the choice of the component parts; the arrangement of the parts in the complete assembly; the construction of pre-production models for proving the design; and the care in the manufacture and final test of the product."
"The principal elements of the sound system for motion pictures are: microphone, amplifiers, recorder, reproducer, and loud speaking receivers. The evolution of these devices began with the invention of the telephone by Bell. In this paper it is shown how subsequent studies relating to the telephone art contributed to their development prior to the advent of commercially successful sound pictures."
"In Germany the cathode ray tube has assumed a definite though not very important role in the field of sound reproduction, and in television it has become of such importance that mechanical methods of scanning are rarely considered nowadays. — The paper describes a new high-vacuum cathode ray tube especially designed for recording sound, the purpose of the development being to avoid the disadvantages inherent in such tubes currently used. The fluorescent line required for recording is produced by means of an electroöptical system in which a controlled accelerating voltage in the path of the electrons from the cathode constitutes the “lens electrode” and achieves the focusing action. The characteristics of the tube are described in detail."
"A discussion of experimental work now being carried on at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on a program of visual education designed to facilitate teaching in the fields of science and engineering. The use of animation and the technic of its application in the first of a series of films showing the behavior of an electrical wave travelling along a 250-mile power transmission line, are described. Other films are considered and the possibilities of animation in other fields of technical training are indicated."
"A review of the film activities of various Federal agencies is presented, their educational significance suggested, and some general observations are made as to the Federal Government's interest in educational films. In conclusion, the vast potentialities of the educational film field are discussed and the part the Federal Government might play in its development pointed out."
"After discussing briefly the evolution of non-theatrical motion pictures, particularly of the amateur type, and discussing briefly the technical and practical requisites of the non-theatrical filmer, the organization of the Amateur Cinema League is described and its aims and purposes discussed."
"When all experimental errors of testing are adequately minimized, cellulose ester sheets show a dispersion of tensile strength values higher than that found for metal strips and wires. The dispersion of “yield point” values is much less than that of tensile strength. — It is suggested that the lowest value (or, at any rate, the bracket of values lower than the average) of tensile strength for a number of tests equivalent to a given film length is a better measure of the probability of failure in performance than the average value. However, for comparative rating, it appears that generally the ratio of lowest to average is fairly constant."
"The first commercial showing of motion pictures in England was probably made by two men with six Edison peep-show Kinetoscopes installed in a shop in Old Broad Street, London, in 1894. Six duplicates of these devices (which had not been patented in England) were built in that year by Paul, and sixty machines during 1895. A camera having a cam-driven intermittent movement was also built in 1895 from a design by Paul and Acres, the latter an English photographer. Printing and developing equipment were developed to process the films made with the camera. In 1895 a second camera was constructed in which intermittency was achieved by means of a modified Geneva stop. The public interest shown in the Kinetoscope and its inadaptability for projection stimulated Paul late in 1895 to design a projector having an intermittent movement consisting of a seven-toothed starwheel. — Many interesting experiences in making and exhibiting pictures during 1896 and subsequent years are described. The first motion picture studio in Great Britain was designed and built by Paul in 1899 at Muswell Hill, North London. Trick films and scientific pictures were made there as well as other subjects. The project was closed about 1910 because it was regarded as too speculative as a side-line to instrument making."
"An accurate system for timing and judging horse-races installed at Santa Anita Park, Calif., consists of photoelectric cells placed around the track at appropriate positions; a visual electric timing board placed in the infield; two electrically driven cameras associated with electrically driven clocks mounted in a booth above the grandstand exactly at the finish line; and rapid film processing and printing equipment connected to the cameras in a darkroom immediately behind them. — The horses at the starting position interrupt the light-beam focused upon the photoelectric cell, transmitting an impulse to a central control cabinet mounted in the camera booth, and thence to the electric clocks associated with the cameras and to the rotary selector switches operating the electric timer in the infield. The time of each quarter-mile interval of the race is recorded visually on the electric timer. — Two special 16-mm. cameras are mounted exactly at the finish line, and are equipped with a double-lens train: one to photograph the horses crossing the line; the other to record, on the same frame, the reading of the clock associated with the camera. The cameras are driven by synchronous motors at speeds of 62 to 101 double frames per second. The electric clocks are crystal-controlled at 200 cps. The clocks are started by the impulse from the first photoelectric cell in the race, and stopped manually after the cameras are stopped. The cameras are operated manually to photograph the order and the time of the finish."
"As a result of the necessity for greater accuracy in rendering decisions of racing events, without appreciable delay, equipment was developed to permit viewing paper enlargements made from 16-mm. motion picture negatives of the finishes within three minutes. The general requirements of the early rapid processing machine are given together with a description and schematic sketch of the machine, and the early cameras and their requirements are also mentioned. — As a result of experience gained in the field with this equipment, certain changes were desired. The design of the new camera is considered in detail, and illustrations of the camera and results accomplished with it are shown. The new processing machine and its enlarging head are described and illustrated."
"A high-fidelity telephone receiver having uniform response over a wide-frequency range is described. The new type of vibrating system compensates for the loss of low-frequency response due to the normal leak between the ear-cap and the ear. Uniform response is maintained at the high frequencies by employing a system of small effective mass reactance. Experimental data obtained with an “artificial ear” show the effect of the acoustic leak upon the response of various types of telephone receivers. Subjective tests are also described and data given which corroborate the tests with the artificial ear."
"Dehumidification, or removal of moisture by adsorption, is a physical process, and not a chemical action. It is accomplished by gas equipment designed specifically for the purpose. Cooling, or the reduction of temperature, is a heat-exchange process requiring indirect surface coolers, through the tubes of which water or other refrigerants at relatively high temperature are passed by equipment selected specifically for the purpose. — This independent control of humidity and temperature by distinctly separate pieces of equipment assures the maximum of flexibility and simplicity of control, and affords a practically limitless selection of conditions for satisfying individual ideas of comfort. — Some of the more important economies and mechanical advantages are: (a) the two separate and distinct operations are accomplished at comparatively high temperature levels, with corresponding economies; (b) the form of energy is used that is best and cheapest for each particular purpose; (c) low maintenance and depreciation results, due to the absence of reciprocating machinery in the dehumidifier, the durability of silica gel, and the reduction of the time of operation for each of the two primary components of the system—dehumidifying only or cooling only, or any combination, under automatic control to meet any and every need."
"A discussion of the functions of the pull-down in relation to the characteristics of the materials of the film and the mechanism, and a brief description of some of the means employed for overcoming the difficulties."
"A recently published editorial by a well known writer of the industry is quoted, in which the importance of excellence of projection is stressed. The possibility is discussed of realizing beneficial results through the coöperation of the SMPE; and the opportunity for educational work with organizations representing the projectionists is pointed out, and the manner in which such educational work might be carried on effectively is discussed."
"Investigating the possibilities of stereo photography in connection with the study of art and other subjects in schools and colleges, the various properties and the historical development of stereo are analyzed, and the significance of the outstanding steps in the development pointed out. — After reviewing the theoretical conditions for accurate reconstruction of the binocular visual image, the practicability of the system using polarized anaglyphs is demonstrated and the advantages of stereo and its probable use in education discussed."
"The recent misunderstanding concerning the 16-mm. sound-film standards has emphasized the need for close coöperation with other standardizing bodies, especially those in Europe. Various proposals to that end have been made, among which were: (1) That the Engineering Vice-president be requested to appoint several European members of the SMPE to the Standards Committee, in order that they may establish a direct liaison between this Committee and the European Committees. (2) That copies of minutes of the meetings of this Committee be sent not only to such foreign members, but also to the secretaries of other Societies interested in motion picture technology and standardization both here and abroad, and to a selected list of persons who might be expected to offer criticisms or suggestions."
"As noted in the Spring report, the Sound Committee has addressed itself to four main projects. Upon the first of these, namely, that of establishing Primary and Secondary Frequency Reference Standards, considerable work has been done, principally because the Committee regards this project the most important, and for that reason concentrated its attention upon it. This report, therefore, will be restricted to that phase of the Committee's work."
"In the motion pictures which you have just witnessed is exemplified the keynote of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers from the day of its inception, nearly twenty years ago, until today as we open this Thirty-Eighth Convention of the Society. Nor will the keynote change as the Society continues down the years in service to the industry and to its membership, for that keynote is “Progress.” Likewise it is the theme of my message to the Society this morning."
"The trend of development of continuous photographic processing, from the beginning of the art to the more recent elaborations of equipment, is discussed from the point of view of the patents issued from 1886 on. An appendix contains a list of patents describing minor improvements and refinements in processing equipment."
"The subject of optical printing is discussed with particular reference to the problems involved and the requirements for good results. After outlining the requisites of a simple printer for registration printing and straight duping, the printer used in the Camera Effects Department at the RKO Studio is described in detail. The paper concludes with a brief description of some of the special work done upon this printer."
"The problem of wide-range reproduction in theaters is discussed with reference to the amplifier output power capacity; the importance of accurate adjustment of equipment; special installation technic; acoustic diagnosis for positioning of high-frequency, mid-range, and low-frequency units; volume setting; and diagnosis of acoustic treatment of backstage interference."
"Results of investigations on sources of direct current for the non-rotating, high-intensity reflecting arc are presented. Data are given on the operating characteristics, including efficiency and power-factor."
"A brief review of the development of 16-mm. sound-film projection and the possible progress in industrial, educational, and non-theatrical uses."
"During the Spring Convention at Hollywood, Calif., May 20—24, 1935, a symposium on new motion picture apparatus was held, in which various manufacturers of equipment described and demonstrated their new products and developments. Some of this equipment is described in the following pages; the remainder will be published in subsequent issues of the Journal."
"The S. C. K. projector (Fig. 10) is intended for continuous projection from a large loop of film during long periods of time. The machine is equipped with a single magazine into which is built the non-rewind device. Pictures may be projected upon a reflecting screen in the usual way or upon a translucent sand blown glass screen. For the latter type of projection the various elements in the sound reproduction system can be rearranged in thirty-five seconds. The machine is provided with an automatic cut-off, which, in case the film breaks, stops all moving parts as well as the light and the sound, before the film travels eight frames."
"The “Diffusionlite system,” the term applied to this form of illumination, was discovered more or less accidentally after repeated efforts to get away from the use of expensive condensers or diffusers during a long period of years of constructing large projecting and enlarging cameras. It was found that by using a mirror at the front of the lamp and projecting all the light upon an electrolytically treated aluminum surface the result was excellent. The light reflected from the myriads of microscopic brilliant facets formed a beam of illumination that was uniform, well distributed, and without perceptible “spot” or “center” or figuration, yet remarkable in its brilliancy and penetration. The resulting enlargements were more beautiful than any we had produced before. This led us to seek a means of employing the same principle for studio lighting. An object could then be photographed with a perfectly diffused light without having to interpose glass or silk screens and thus lose considerable brilliancy."
"A descriptive report of current methods of handling photosensitive materials in motion picture laboratories; a résumé of practical methods of manipulating raw stock, picture negative, sound-track negative, duplicating picture and sound negative, regular positive prints, master positive prints, and special films in the various laboratories of the United States. In addition are presented descriptions of equipment in current use and the general arrangement and appointments of processing laboratories."
"The properties of various developers, including a two-bath hardening developer suitable for the rapid processing of negatives, are described. In the case of still photography, considerable time can be saved by printing from the wet negatives. Several methods are described for holding the negative to prevent damage to the wet emulsion by the heat of the printer light."
"Two developing machines for laboratory use have been designed and constructed to approximate some of the development characteristics frequently encountered in commercial practice. They are arranged to accommodate only small quantities of film, but rapid film motion is attained by splicing the films into a loop, thus permitting reasonably high linear speeds. — A photoelectric densitometer was constructed which is in use as a secondary standard of density measurement, the mechanical features of its design affording good reproducibility and rapid operation."
"One of the problems engaging the attention of this Sub-committee has been that of working out some sensitometric control method which might be put in operation in each laboratory and which would result in a more uniform quality of release print from a given negative, from the standpoint of both picture and sound."
"As a first step, the Standard Sensitometric Control Group prepared and circulated a general questionnaire to all laboratories making release prints, designed to obtain a comparison of the controls utilized in each laboratory. A very good response was obtained, twelve release print laboratories having returned fully completed questionnaires."
"A simple description of the laws governing the release of electrons from photoelectric surfaces, their collection at anodes, and the creation of ions in photoelectric cell gases by the ‘ionization’ process, and questions of spectral selectivity of various photoelectric surfaces, the influence of spectral characteristics of illumination, and the dynamic characteristics of vacuum and gas-filled cells."
"The various factors that must be considered in the acoustical design and treatment of theaters are outlined, as a guide to architects and engineers in solving the more common problems arising in this particular phase of motion picture engineering. — Fundamental considerations, such as proportions, shape, sound insulation, stage, etc., are briefly covered. The relation of “fixed” absorption to surface acoustic treatment is also discussed. Curves recommended by Electrical Research Products, Inc., showing optimal and percentage optimal reverberation times as functions of volume and frequency, respectively, are offered. Particular stress is placed upon the necessity of carefully selecting the materials for theater treatment with respect to their sound-absorbing efficiencies throughout the frequency range."
"Most sounds consist of a spectrum of frequencies of various intensities. The distribution of the frequencies and intensities determines the quality of the sound. The spectrum may remain fairly constant in time, or it may go through rapid changes. Sound analysis is the process by which the various components of the spectrum are detected and measured. A complete analysis should furnish the frequency and amplitude of each component as well as its phase relatively to the other components, at a given instant of time. If the spectrum changes in time, a complete analysis should be made at intervals throughout the duration of the sound, the lengths of the intervals being determined by the rate at which the spectrum is changing. — For purposes of analysis sounds may be grouped into four classes: (1) sounds that may be maintained at constant frequency, constant intensity, and unvarying quality for a period long enough to carry out the analysis; (2) sounds that are essentially transient in nature; (3) sounds that may be maintained constant, on the average, but whose frequency, intensity, and quality vary periodically within this time; (4) sounds that are entirely random in form but are continuously maintained. The first two groups of sounds require different methods of analysis. The third group in certain instances may be analyzed by the methods used for class 1, whereas in others the method used for class 2 may be necessary. Sounds of class 4 may be analyzed by all methods capable of analyzing sounds of class 1 with one exception. — Instruments for analysis may be grouped into five classes: graphic, resonance, heterodyne, stroboscopic, and diffraction analyzers. The operation of each type of instrument is briefly discussed and the suitability of each for analyzing the various classes of sounds is brought out. Examples of analyses performed by the various methods are presented."
"After considering the difficulties involved in the direct method of x-ray cinematography, in which the x-rays penetrate the subject and pass directly to the photographic film with intensities depending upon the absorption of the subject, some of the work done by the author by means of the indirect method is described. In the indirect method, the x-ray image of the subject upon the fluorescent screen is photographed in reduced size by means of a suitable lens system. Various difficulties and factors of the system to be considered are discussed, and examples of the results attained by the indirect method are presented."
"Duplicates of positives or negatives can be made by the familiar process of exposure, standard development, and fixation of a single film without requiring second exposure and development, as in the case of amateur motion picture reversible film, or resort to the duplicate negative process. Contact printing is required with exposures about equal to those used in printing chloride photographic paper emulsions. The emulsion, although of silver bromide composition, is of a type entirely different from all other photographic emulsions, making use of the solarization effect for the first time in practical photography. Some commercial possibilities of the new type of emulsion are seen in the duplication of x-ray and other valuable transparency originals, aerial mapping, motion picture still picture printing, photo reproduction practice, and general commercial photography."
"Motion pictures have been used for advertising for a number of years, but only in the last few years has the use of the business film reached such outstanding proportions. The majority of such films are now shown on 16-mm. sound equipment. — Some of the applications that have been made and the various groupings into which the several types of advertising pictures fall are described, including a brief historical explanation of why various types of films came into use."
"During the Conventions of the Society, symposiums on new motion picture apparatus are held, in which various manufacturers of equipment describe and demonstrate their new products and developments. Some of this equipment is described in the following pages; the remainder will be published in subsequent issues of the Journal."
"Due to the considerable increase of interest in, and the use of, slide-film projectors of all sorts for educational and commercial purposes, a symposium on the subject was held at the Chicago Convention of the Society on April 30, 1936. Following are three of the papers presented in the symposium, and the joint discussion that followed two of them."
"This report of the Progress Committee covers the year 1935. The advances in the cinematographic art are classified as follows: (I) Cinematography; (II) Sound Recording; (III) Sound and Picture Reproduction; (IV) Film Laboratory Practice and Sensitometry; (V) Publications and New Books; Appendix A—General Field of Progress of the Motion Picture Industry in Great Britain; Appendix B—General Field of Progress of the Motion Picture Industry in Japan."
"A description of recent work carried on to study and formulate requirements to be met by the sound systems of motion picture theaters in order that the reproduction may be of a quality consistent with the recording technic available for some years to come. After setting up requirements relating to sound equipment; load capacitites; efficiency; volume ranges; transient, phase, and attenuation distortion; horn distribution characteristics; size; weight; costs; etc., the paper goes on to describe the design, installation, and performance, of the Shearer two-way horn system, engineered to meet the high standard of performance set up. The material of the paper is useful not only in connection with motion picture sound systems but also with public address systems and home radio equipments."
"A description of the theoretical and practical design of dividing networks for use in coupling power amplifiers to loud speaker systems in which two sets of horns are used for reproducing the sound energy. Performance curves and design data are given to facilitate the engineering of such networks."
"A report of the Scientific Committee of the Research Council of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Hollywood, California, May 18, 1936. Whereas excessive skepticism held the minds of those in the industry some years ago when sound was about to be introduced into the picture, now, in the case of television, instead of disbelief, we have excessive credulity. The report discusses briefly a few of the factors that would be involved upon the introduction of television, and concludes with the statement that there appears to be no danger that television will burst unexpectedly upon an unprepared motion picture industry."
"As an aid to scientific research, Science Service has sponsored development and operation of microphotographic duplication, making available copies of books in libraries and science documents in two forms: (1) reduced-size photographic images upon standard 35-mm. motion picture film, called microfilms; (2) photoprint enlargements from the microfilms. Microfilms need optical aid in order to be read, whereas photoprints can be read with the unaided eye. Two services are in active operation: namely, the Bibliofilm Service in the Library of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, and the Auxiliary Publication Service in coöperation with editors of scientific journals. Application of microphotographic duplication to the important and complex problem of bibliography is suggested."
"Photographs are shown of a book-copying camera using 35-mm. positive motion picture film, and the special features of this camera are discussed. The problem of the reduction ratio is discussed and illustrations shown, with the conclusion that a 10 or 12 to 1 reduction ratio should be employed for book copy work on 35-mm. positive motion picture film. — Photographs are shown of a reading machine of the author's design, and various aspects of the problem are discussed."
"Microphotographic duplication peculiarly fits the research needs of modern scholarship for the following reasons: it reduces the bulk of records in the same geometric ratio in which they are accumulating; it makes them as permanent as they are now ephemeral; it makes them mobile, permitting a more widespread use of them; it makes it possible to supply records for specialized use; it facilitates the cooperative exploitation of records that have become so extensive that they can no longer be mastered individually; and it permits a more exact and accurate use of records."
"During the Conventions of the Society, symposiums on new motion picture apparatus are held, in which various manufacturers of equipment describe and demonstrate their new products and developments. Some of this equipment is described in the following pages; the remainder will be published in subsequent issues of the Journal."
"The demand for higher levels of illumination in 16-mm. projection has led to an investigation of the possibilities of improving the efficiency of the optical systems involved. An analysis of spherical and aspheric condensers of various designs is presented to show the best possible combination with an f/1.65 projection lens and the present high-intensity biplane filament type of lamp."
"Normal persons can make visual distinctions of three types: light from dark, yellow from blue, red from green; light-dark being the most primitive type of discrimination, and red-green the last acquired. Some otherwise normal persons fail to develop in their organs of sight more than a vestige of the mechanism for red-green discrimination. They are called red-green blind, or partially color-blind. A few persons have only the ability to make light-dark discrimination; they are called totally color-blind. These types of abnormality are discussed and tests for red-green blindness described."
"A consideration of present practices in the art of cleaning air, beginning with a description of the solid impurities found in the air in industrial centers and in a number of large cities of the United States. The historical development of air cleaning is described briefly, with particular attention to adhesive impingement filters, automatic viscous filters, dry air-filters, and electric precipitators."
"Motion pictures with sound recording, which can be said to represent second and third dimensions in recording history, are to be given full status with other Federal Archives. The movement was sponsored by the S. M. P. E. Committee on Preservation of Film in 1930, and one of the early advocates of including motion pictures in the archives of the nation was Mr. Will Hays. The preservation of film was one of the chief problems, and is now being worked out by the Bureau of Standards under the joint sponsorship of the National Archives and the Carnegie Foundation through an original research project under an Advisory Committee set up by the National Research Council. The Committee on Preservation of Film of the S. M. P. E. is assisting in the work. The service to be rendered by such a great national film library has many possibilities."
"A brief discussion of the technical and dramatic difficulties encountered in prducing motion pictures containing operatic sequences, and some of the factors that would be involved in producing conplete operas upon the screen."
"The benefits to be expected from establishing projection departments in the large theater chains are briefly discussed, and suggestions are made as to the desirable scope of authority to be granted to the heads of such departments. The relation between such a projection department and the individual theaters of the chain is considered, and the economic advantages accruing from the arrangement in the form of more effective projection and in purchasing equipment are discussed."
"A general discussion of the relations between motion picture writing and engineering technic, together with a brief discussion of the problems facing the writers and the manner of adapting stories to the motion picture technic."
"During the Fall Convention at Washington, D. C., Oct. 21–25, 1935, a symposium on new motion picture apparatus was held, in which various manufacturers of equipment described and demonstrated their new products and developments. Some of this equipment is described in the following pages; the remainder will be published in subsequent issues of the Journal."
"These Standards apply to all types of fuses whether for indoor or outdoor service, except fuses for 600-volts and below for which specifications of the National Electric Code definitely define the requirements."
"The standards in this section shall apply to all types of lightning arresters designed for the protection of alternating-current power circuits."
"Presents the title page of the proceedings record."
"The Conference on Electrical Insulation was organized in 1922 to serve as a common meeting ground for physicists, chemists, engineers and other scientists who, though working in widely different fields, have a community of interest in the theory and practical applications of dielectrics."

"The paper reviews work on high voltage underground cable insulation covering the following points: insulating oil; accelerated oxidation stability; resin ;mineral oil; catalytic effect; insulating metal; lead soap; copper soap; wax formation; chlorine containing compound; ordinary insulating paper esterification; power factor; moisture absorption reduction; paper washing; synthetic insulating material ;gas vapor mixture; and breakdown strength."
"The October 1956 issure of Modern Plastics(l5) contains an excellent review of the various classes of synthetic resins together with their electrical and physical properties. The groups: phenol formaldehyde, urea formaldehyde, furfural formaldehyde, cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate, ethyl cellulose, vinyl resins, casein, acrylic, cumarone, polystyrene and synthetic rubber are discussed at considerable length. The methods of manufacture are briefly explained. Their uses and properties are more completely described. The table of properties checked by the Bureau of Standards is the most complete and accurate the writer has seen. Properties which are included and are of especial interest to the electrical engineer are water absorption, heat resistance, breakdown voltage, dielectric constant, power factor, and softening point. Many other physical, chemical, and mechanical properties are given. The aniline formaldehyde and phthalic anhydride groups are not mentioned."
"Although the literature of paper is voluminous, that on electrical insulating papers is meager. Less than 2% of the cataloged articles on electrical insulation in the New York Public Library deal specifically with paper. When we consider only electrical insulating paper literature for 1936-1937, there is hardly sufficient for a report. It has seemed best, therefore, to include in this review other aspects of paper which are of importance electrically."
"A knowledge of molecular structure and the related physical and chemical properties is of fundamental importance to the solution of many theoretical and practical problems in both academic and industrial realms. It is obvious that the relative progress in the field of electrical insulation is in part determined by the extent of such information made available. Among the several methods which the physicists and chemists have been employing in their search for added structural information the dielectric and conductance dispersion studies have brought distinct contributions to our knowledge of structure and behavior of molecules, especially in view of the increasing volume and variety of researches reported in literature during the past year."
"In the past year and a half practically nothing has been published in the periodical literature on new developments in rubber as a dielectric. Most of the advances are recorded in patents. In view of the frequent deficiencies of such disclosures it is difficult to evaluate them properly."
"Recent developments in research on insulating oils are largely concerned with methods of testing and evaluation rather than with the development of new or better petroleum products. Without adequate test methods (other than long time service tests), no criteria are available for distinguishing between good and bad liquid dielectrics. Unfortunately, a large amount of isolated individual research, by independent companies, has not been published and is, therefore, not available to oil chemists."
"This standard relates only to relays of types directly associated with power switchgear. It does not cover relays of types designed primarily for industrial control, excitation or governor regulating, telephone, telegraph, traffic signal, or similar purpose."
