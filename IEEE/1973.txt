"It is shown that the rate-distortion bound(R(d) \\leq C)remains true when-\\log xin the definition of mutual information is replaced by an arbitrary concave(\\cup)nonincreasing function satisfying some technical conditions. Examples are given showing that for certain choices of the concave functions, the bounds obtained are better than the classical rate-distortion bounds."
"In a variety of practical problems involving random processes, it is necessary to have statistical information on their level-crossing properties. This paper presents a survey of known results on certain aspects of this problem and provides a basis for further study in the area. The goal has been to give a broad view of the problems considered in the literature and a brief indication of the techniques used in their solution. Much material of a more or less historical nature has been included since, to the authors' knowledge, no other survey of this nature exists."
"LetR(s,t)be a covariance function having the representation \\begin{equation} R(s,t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp (isx - ity)d^2 G(x,y) \\end{equation} whereG(x,y)is continuous to the right in both variables and is of bounded variation in the plane; thenR(s,t)is harmonizable in thatG(x,y)is also a covariance. We give examples in which this result is used to determine the harmonizability of new processes and covariances that are formed by operations on old processes and covariances. Specifically, ifX(t)is a real Gaussian harmonizable process, thenX^n (t)is harmonizable. IfX(t)is harmonizable,d^2 G(x,y)has bounded support andg(t)is a Fourier-Stieltjes transform, thenX(g(t))andX(t + g(t))are harmonizable. If \\begin{equation} X(t) =\\int_{-\\infty}^{infty} f(t,u) dZ(u) \\end{equation} wheref (t,u) = f (t - u)is a Fourier-Stieltjes transform andG(u,v) = E(Z(u)Z^{\\ast} (v))has finite total variation, thenX(t)is harmonizable. We also obtain a sufficient condition for Priestley's oscillatory processes to be harmonizable. We find that the Bochner-Eberlein characterization of Fourier-Stieltjes transforms, while not the only method, is particularly convenient for determining the harmonizability of these examples."
 "This paper presents a class of majority-logic decodable codes whose structure is based on the structural properties of Euclidean geometries (EG) and codes that are invariant under the affine group of permutations. This new class of codes contains the ordinary EG codes and some generalized EG codes as subclasses. One subclass of new codes is particularly interesting: they are the most efficient majority-logic decodable codes that have been constructed."
 "The detection of information-bearing Gaussian processes immersed in additive white Gaussian noise (WGN) is an important problem that arises in many signal processing applications. When the level of the WGN is unknown, classical approaches to the problem fail. In this paper a principle of invariance is used to derive a detector with performance that is invariant (or insensitive) to system gain, or equivalently channel attenuation. The detector structure can be realized and detection thresholds set without prior knowledge of the WGN level. When the observation interval is large the detector has the structure of a spectral estimator-correlator, the output of which is compared to an adaptive threshold. The invariance feature of the detector makes it a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) receiver; an ad hoc structure for suboptimal CFAR Gauss-Gauss detection is discussed as well."
"In this correspondence a binary maximal comma-free code for words of length 10 and the search technique used to construct it are described."
"A general decoding method for cyclic codes is presented which gives promise of substantially reducing the complexity of decoders at the cost of a modest increase in decoding time (or delay). Significant reductions in decoder complexity for binary cyclic finite-geometry codes are demonstrated."
"The coding theory literature for the period 1967-1972 is surveyed. Four contributions considered to be of special merit are identified. A brief description of several books solely concerned with coding theory is presented. The major themes reflected in selected English-language journals are outlined. More than 100 references are cited to illustrate these themes."
"Joint optimization of transmitting and receiving filters in pulse-amplitude-modulated stationary Gaussian channels has been considered by a large number of authors under a variety of different circumstances. In most cases it has been found that the optimum filters are strictly band limited. In the present correspondence we give a direct argument why this must be so for a broad class of joint optimization problems."
"For symmetric sources we examine the rate of convergence to the rate-distortion function using block codes and tree codes. With block codes the average distortion decreases toward distortionDat a doubly exponential rate in block length for any fixed rate greater thanR(D), the rate-distortion function. For tree codes a difference equation for the probability distribution of the distortion is derived with tree depth as an independent variable. Its numerical solution suggests that the same doubly exponential convergence behavior applies to tree codes."
"A binary double-phased-burst-error-correcting block code of rate 1/2 has been discovered by computer search. This code is quasi-cyclic, has a total burst-length-to-redundancy asymptotic ratio of 2/5, and is quite easily decodable. It can correct two phased-burst errors, each of length two digits or less. To correct larger nonphased bursts, interleaving is required."
"In the above paper,^1Bahl et aL described a bidirectional search algorithm for computing the free distance of convolutional codes. There are some flaws in that algorithm. This correspondence contains a corrected version of the algorithm together with a proof that the corrected version always computes the free distance for noncatastrophic codes."
"It is shown that a majority-logic decoding algorithm proposed by Lin and Weldon for the product of anL-step and a one-step orthogonalizable code is incomplete whenLis greater than unity. An improvement is presented to overcome this disadvantage in the binary case."
"A linear correspondence is developed between the states of a rate-k/nconvolutional encoderGand the states of a corresponding syndrome formerH^T, whereHis an encoder of the code dual to the code generated byG. This correspondence is used to find an expression for the number of all-zero paths of length\\tauin the code trellis; the answer depends only on the constraint lengths of the dual code. A partial answer to the resynchronization problem also falls out of this development."
"Sequential decoding procedures are studied in the context of selecting a path through a tree. Several algorithms are considered and their properties compared. It is shown that the stack algorithm introduced by Zigangirov and by Jelinek is essentially equivalent to the Fano algorithm with regard to the set of nodes examined and the path selected, although the description, implementation, and action of the two algorithms are quite different. A modified Fano algorithm is introduced, in which the quantizing parameter\\Deltais eliminated. It can be inferred from limited simulation results that, at least in some applications, the new algorithm is computationally inferior to the old; however, it is of some theoretical interest since the conventional Fano algorithm may be considered to be a quantized version of it."
"Given the alphabetA = \\{ \\pm a_0, \\cdots, \\pm a_i, \\cdots, \\pm a_{N-1} \\}the problem investigated is the construction of the largest set of mutually orthogonal sequences of lengthnunder the following constraint on the form of the sequences. Each sequence is a concatenation ofnelements fromAbut not all concatenations are allowed. Rather, the sign of thejth element is negative if and only if the(j - 1)st element is negative with an odd subscript, or the(j - 1)st element is positive with an even subscript. Such sequences have application in continuous-phase frequency-shift-keyed communication. The principal result is the construction of optimal sets of\\nu (N,n)mutually orthogonal sequences under the phase constraint. Ifnis the order of a Hadamard matrix, then\\nu = nN/2, forNeven, andn(N - 1)/2 + 1, forNodd."
"Previously, a coding theorem and its converse for stationary asymptotically memoryless continuous-time channels were proved, giving the capacityCwith an almost sure constraint on the input cost. For calculation, it is more convenient to find a capacity\\bar{C}with the constraint on the expected input cost. Obviously,C \\leq \\bar{C}, but the coding theorem may not hold for\\bar{C}. For a class of input costs typified by the time-average power, we prove the coding theorem for\\bar{C}by directly showingC = \\bar{C}."
"Sharp upper and lower bounds of the Chebyshev type are established for the probability of error due to intersymbol interference and additive Gaussian noise in a digital communication system. The results are in relatively closed form, and the only statistical knowledge assumed about the interference is the peak eye opening and the variance. The bounds apply to correlated and uncorrelated signals and for any signal to noise ratio."
"We consider ann-dimensional vector space overGF(q)which has a probability distribution defined on it. The sum of the probabilities over a properk-dimensional subspace is compared to a sum over a coset of this subspace. The difference of these set probabilities is related to a sum of the Fourier transforms of the distribution over a subset of the domain of the transforms. We demonstrate the existence of a coset and both an upper and a lower bound on the difference associated with this coset. The bounds depend on the maximum and nonzero minimum of the transforms as defined on a special subset of the transform domain. Two examples from coding theory are presented. The first deals with aq-ary symmetric channel while the second is concerned with a binary compound channel."
"It is shown by Shannon that the zero-error capacity of a noisy channel may be increased with feedback. However, feedback cannot improve the zero-error capacity of all memoryless channels. The graphs of discrete memoryless channels are classified on the basis of whether feedback increases the zero-error capacity or not."
"Correlated information sequences\\cdots ,X_{-1},X_0,X_1, \\cdotsand\\cdots,Y_{-1},Y_0,Y_1, \\cdotsare generated by repeated independent drawings of a pair of discrete random variablesX, Yfrom a given bivariate distributionP_{XY} (x,y). We determine the minimum number of bits per characterR_XandR_Yneeded to encode these sequences so that they can be faithfully reproduced under a variety of assumptions regarding the encoders and decoders. The results, some of which are not at all obvious, are presented as an admissible rate region\\mathcal{R}in theR_X - R_Yplane. They generalize a similar and well-known result for a single information sequence, namelyR_X \\geq H (X)for faithful reproduction."
"It is well known that the Barankin bound is locally the tightest lower bound on the variance of any unbiased estimator. If the minimum-variance unbiased-parameter estimation problem is viewed as a minimum-norm problem in an appropriate Hilbert space, the Barankin bound has a very simple geometric interpretation. This interpretation also gives some insight into the influence of bias on the estimation error."
"The Karhunen-Loève expansion of a random process is used to derive the impulse response of the optimal realizable linear estimator for the process. The expansion is truncated to yield an approximate state-variable model of the process in terms of the firstNeigenvalues and eigenfunctions. The Kalman-Bucy filter for this model provides an approximate realizable linear estimator which approaches the optimal one asN \\rightarrow \\infty. A bound on the truncation error is obtained."
"In this correspondence, we comment on some of the shortcomings, for source encoding problems, of the measure of distance between orthonormal representations proposed by Pearl.^1We further examine, using rate-distortion theory, whether rates achievable for a given distortion level by the use of basis-restricted transformations have some inherent dissimilarity independently of input statistics and of other implied parameters."
"A computer simulation technique is used to evaluate the performance of the MAP strategy for sequential block orthogonal signaling over a Gaussian channel with noiseless and delayless feedback. The system performance is given in terms of the character error probability. The obtained results are compared with those derived using other suboptimum strategies previously proposed."
"Suppose white noise is put into anRCfilter with time constant1/awhose output is hard limited and fed into a secondRCfilter with time constant1/b. The density of the outputy(t)of the system has been the subject of several investigations. Most recently, Pawula and Tsai made the conjecture that for Gaussian white noise they(t)density is given by a certain expression, a special case of which was derived earlier by Doyle, McFadden, and Marx forb/a = 2. In this paper an expression for thenth moment ofy(t)is found. From the expression for the fourth moment, it is proven that the Pawula-Tsai conjecture is not true in general. It is further found that if the output of the hard limiter were wide-sense Markov, the Pawula-Tsai conjecture would be true."
"We present a new derivation of the source coding theorem for discrete-time sources. This proof parallels Gallager's [1] derivation of the random coding bound for channel coding theory and shows that the classical random coding exponent also emerges as a critical quantity for source coding. The major advantage of this approach is the simplicity of the derivation and its close relationship to the more familiar channel coding theory. The source coding theorem we derive here also yields a natural bound on the rate of convergence to the rate-distortion limit."
"A new type of nonlinear filter, called theE-filter, is introduced that involves a transformation of the independent variable of the input function. It is shown how anE-filter can be designed to filter out superimposed \"noise\" on a signal, leaving the large peaks of the signal unattenuated. Unlike a Iow-pass linear filter, the low-passE-filter is almost frequency independent and so does not affect the amplitudes of large sharp peaks of the signal. It is shown that theE-filter can be realized in real time and that a wide class ofE-filters have a filtering action which is independent of the dc level of the input signal."
"This paper considers binary pattern recognition of a non-Gaussian pattern in Gaussian noise using supervised learning. The scheme is both structure and parameter adaptive. To facilitate a feasible solution, certain judicious approximations are used. Two examples are presented to demonstrate the learning capability of the proposed algorithms."
"Optimum nonlinear receivers for digital signaling over channels with a relatively long impulse response become too complex to be practical. In this paper a suboptimum but simple and practical receiver is proposed for such channels. The receiver consists of a linear adaptive equalizer in cascade with a maximum-likelihood sequence estimator. A general method of finding the error probability of a maximum-likelihood sequence estimator (MLSE) in the presence of correlated noise is developed. An upper bound on the performance of an MLSE is also presented for the case when thc actual channel is different from the channel estimate known to the MLSE. The performance of the proposed receiver is analyzed and results of the analysis and computer simulation are shown for a typical telephone channel."
"The error probability for a class of binary recursive feedback strategies is evaluated. An exact analysis is given for both a nonsequential and a sequential decision strategy. We obtain the interesting result that even for the nonsequential receiver the error probability vanishes exponentially fast at channel capacity. A similar result had been previously obtained by Horstein for the sequential receiver, but was believed to be a consequence of the sequential nature of his decision strategy. For rates below capacity our feedback strategies have two error exponents, i.e., a lower error exponentE^- (R)and an upper error exponentE^+ (R). The lower error exponentE^- (R)exhibits an anomalous behavior in thatE^- (R)increases monotonically fromE^- (0) = 0toE^- (C) = E(C)as the rateRincreases from 0 to capacity."
"A nonstationary signal source can be decomposed into subsources if it exhibits certain characteristics. Adaptive predictive coding is considered as a method of extracting these subsources from the composite source in such a way that the overall communication problem can then be viewed as two different, but connected, communication problems: 1) transmission of predictor parameters, and 2) transmission of the subsource using difference signals. An intermediate fidelity criterion is defined that describes the effects of predictor parameter distortion on the reconstruction of the difference signal. Then a rate-distortion bound on the channel requirements for the transmission of the predictor parameters is found, subject to a dual fidelity criterion. The approach is applicable to a wide range of nonstationary signal classes. The speech process is chosen here because of the wide interests in the information content of speech. The signal class consists specifically of selected voiced phrases."
"A new nonparametric method of estimating the Bayes risk using an unclassified test sample set as well as a classified design sample set is introduced. The classified design set is used to obtain nonparametric estimates of the conditional Bayes risk of classification at each point of the unclassified test set. The average of these risk estimates is the error estimate. For large numbers of design samples the new error estimate has less variance than does an error-count estimate for classified test samples using the optimum Bayes classifier. The first application of the nonparametric method usesk-nearest neighbor (k-NN) estimates of the posterior probabilities to form the risk estimate. A large-sample analysis is made of this estimate. The expected value of this estimate is shown to be a lower bound on the Bayes error. A simple modification provides unbiased estimates of thek-NN classification error, thus providing an upper bound on the Bayes error. The second application of the method uses Parzen approximation of the density functions to obtain estimates of the risk and subsequently the Bayes error. Results of experiments on simulated data illustrate the small-sample behavior."
"A new class of lower bounds to rate-distortion functions of stationary processes with memory and single-letter vector-valued distortion measures is derived. This class is shown to include or imply all other well-known lower bounds to rates of such sources and distortion measures. The derivation is based on the definition and properties of the conditional rate-distortion function. In addition to providing a unified and intuitive approach to lower bounds, this approach yields several interesting relations among conditional, joint, and marginal rates that are similar to and sometimes identical with the analogous relations among the corresponding entropies."
"The problem of determining the first-order probability density of a filtered version of hard-limitedRCnoise is considered. An integral equation for the density is derived by using Siegert's results on zero-crossing distributions forRCnoise. We also show how the integral equation can be obtained from a two-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation. The exact solution of the integral equation has not been found, but some general information is available. An iterative scheme for determining the moments has been found, and some information has been obtained regarding the behavior of the density as the variable approaches the ends of its range. One result of this portion of the investigation is a disproof of au expression for the density conjectured by Pawula and Tsai. Finally, curves for the density are obtained by solving the integral equation numerically."
"The resolvability of point sources of incoherent thermal light is analyzed by quantum detection theory in terms of two hypothesis-testing problems. In the first, the observer must decide whether there are two sources of equal radiant power at given locations, or whether there is only one source of twice the power located midway between them. In the second problem, either one, but not both, of two point sources is radiating, and the observer must decide which it is. The decisions are based on optimum processing of the electromagnetic field at the aperture of au optical instrument. In both problems the density operators of the field under the two hypotheses do not commute. The error probabilities, determined as functions of the separation of the points and the mean number of received photons, characterize the ultimate resolvability of the sources."
"This paper deals with the problem of recovering a band-limited process after it has been distorted by an instantaneous non-linearity and subsequently band-limited. Several uniqueness theorems for the input-output relationships are derived. In contrast with the deterministic case, no requirement that the nonlinearity be monotonic is made here. An iterative procedure for the recovery of the input is presented. Applications to two-level quantizers are considered, and a new result on the determination of a band-limited Gaussian process from its zero crossings is obtained."
  "We define a distance measure for block codes used over memoryless channels and show that it is related to upper and lower bounds on the low-rate error probability in the same way as Hamming distance is for binary block codes used over the binary symmetric channel. We then prove general Gilbert bounds for block codes using this distance measure. Some new relationships between coding theory and rate-distortion theory are presented."
"A sample-whitened matched filter (SWMF) for a channel with intersymbol interference and additive white Gaussian noise is defined as a linear filter with the properties that its output samples are a sufficient statistic for the MAP estimation of the transmitted sequence and have uncorrelated noise components. These filters are shown to exist for ali realistic channels and the complete set of SWMF's for any channel is determined. It is shown that for nonpathological channels there is a unique SWMF which minimizes the amount of intersymbol interference defined as the discrete-time analog to the rms duration of a continuous-time signal. Finally, the theory is extended to more general modulation systems including pulse position modulation and frequency position modulation."
"In this paper we construct a linear code having length 48, minimum distance 8, and containing2^{31}codewords. This code is obtained by augmenting a (48,22,8) linear code with2^9- 1 cosets so that the minimum distance is not reduced. The (48,22,8) code used is the direct product of a (16,11,4) extended Hamming code and a (3,2,2) single-parity-check code. The new code has twice as many codewords as the best linear or nonlinear code previously known."
"The editedknearest neighbor rule (k-NNR) consists of 1) eliminating those samples from the data which are not classified correctly by thek-NNR and the remainder of the data, and 2) using the NNR with the samples which remain from 1) to classify new observations. Wilson has shown that this rule has an asymptotic probability of error which is better than that of thek-NNR. A key step in his development is showing the convergence of the edited nearest neighbor. His lengthy argument is replaced here by a somewhat simpler one which uses an intuitive fact about the editing procedure."
"The entropyHof an absolutely continuous distribution with probability density functionp(x)is defined asH = - \\int p(x) \\log p(x) dx. The formal maximization ofH, subject to the moment constraints\\int x^r p(x) dx = \\mu_r, r = 0,1,\\cdots,m, leads top(x) = \\exp (- \\sum_{r=0}^m \\lamnbda_r x^r), where the\\lambda_rhave to be chosen so as to satisfy the moment constraints. Only the casem = 2is considered. It is shown that whenxhas finite range, a distribution maximizing the entropy exists and is unique. When the range is[0,\\infty), the maximum-entropy distribution exists if, and only if,\\mu_2 \\leq 2 \\mu_1^2, and a table is given which enables the maximum-entropy distribution to be computed. The case\\mu_2 > 2 \\mu_1^2is discussed in some detail."
"In this correspondence, we consider factoring the spectral matrix of discrete-time systems. The factoring involves finding a matrixH(z)such thatH(z^{-1})H^T (z)equals the spectral matrix and that bothH(z)andH^{-1} (z)are stable and nonanticipatory. The purpose of this paper is to present a new method for obtaining such a spectral factorization."
"It is shown in the classification problem, when independent samples are taken from uniform distributions, that for small sample sizes the probability of misclassification when using the nearest-neighbor rule is \"close\" to its asymptotic value. It is also shown that when using this rule the probability of classification in many cases is close to its Bayes optimum even for small sample sizes. Moreover, if one is restricted to a small sample size from one population, it is shown that it is not necessary to \"make up\" this deficiency by taking a large sample from the other population; best results may be obtained when both sample sizes are small."
"An estimate of an upper bound on performance in terms of probability of error is developed for maximum-likelihood sequence estimation over channels for which only the pulse response energy and duration are known. This bound is evaluated for channels with a pulse response duration up to 10 signaling intervals, and the related minimum-distance channel codes are presented."
"An expression is obtained for the expected duration of a search to find a givenL-ary sequence in a semi-infinite stream of randomL-ary data. The search time is found to be an increasing function of the lengths of the \"bifices\" of the pattern, where the term bifix denotes a sequence which is both a prefix and a suffix."
"A bifix of anL-aryn-tuple is a sequence which is both a prefix and a suffix of thatn-tuple. The practical importance of bifix-free patterns is emphasized, and we devise a systematic way of generating all such sequences and determine their number."
"A class of lower bounds to rate-distortion functions of stationary sources with context-dependent fidelity criteria is derived by mapping the source and distortion measure into an equivalent restricted-transition stationary source with a single-letter fidelity criterion, and then applying the composite bound. This approach is seen to yield bounds which, although sometimes quite loose, apply to general stationary sources and context-dependent fidelity criteria. Two examples are presented."
"An upper bound on the speed of convergence of Blahut algorithm is derived. This bound is inversely proportional to the number of iterations."
"By using the more general class of BCH codes, rather than RS codes as originally proposed, the results of Justesen [1] are improved for code rates below 0.07. The value ofd/nfor the new codes approaches the Varsharmov-Gilbert hound (0.5) as the rate approaches zero."
      "The error covariance matrix corresponding to optimal linear causal filtering of second-order stationary processes in additive noise is considered. Formulas expressing this error matrix in terms of the optimal transfer function are established, and in the nonsingular case the optimal transfer function is expressed in terms of the spectral densities. These are straightforward generalizations of previously published scalar results, and the derivation is similarly based on Hardy space theory. Explicit bounds on the minimal error (i.e., the trace of the optimal error covariance matrix) are obtained for filtering in white noise. Furthermore, an explicit expression for the error covariance matrix is derived for the case of transmitting the same signal over several white-noise channels."
"Thenth-order characteristic functions (cf) of spherically-invariant random processes (sirp) with zero means are defined as cf, which are functions ofnth-order quadratic forms of arbitrary positive definite matricesp. Everynth-order spherically-invariant characteristic function (sicf) is represented as a weighted Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral transform of an arbitrary univariate probability distribution functionF(\\cdot)on[0,\\infty). Furthermore, everynth-order sicf has a corresponding spherically-invariant probability density (sipd). Then we show that everynth-order sicf (or sipd) is a random mixture of anth-order Gaussian cf [or probability density]. The randomization is performed on\\nu^2 \\rho, where\\nuis a random variable (tv) specified by theF(\\cdot)function. Examples of sirp are given. Relations to previously known results are discussed. Various expectation properties of Gaussian random processes are valid for sirp. Related conditional expectation, mean-square estimation, semMndependence, martingale, and closure properties are given. Finally, the form of the unit threshold likelihood ratio receiver in the detection of a known deterministic signal in additive sirp noise is shown to be a correlation receiver or a matched filter. The associated false-alarm and detection probabilities are expressed in closed forms."
"For the purpose of localizing a distant noisy target, or, conversely, calibrating a receiving array, the time delays defined by the propagation across the array of the target-generated signal wavefronts are estimated in the presence of sensor-to-sensor-independent array self-noise. The Cramér-Rao matrix bound for the vector delay estimate is derived, and used to show that either properly filtered beamformers or properly filtered systems of multiplier-correlators can be used to provide efficient estimates. The effect of suboptimally filtering the array outputs is discussed."
"A short-time dyadic autocorrelation function (dacf) and a short-time Walsh energy spectrum of the first kind are defined in the Walsh-Fourier domain. The \"natural\" choice of the short-time functions does not lead to a Walsh-Fourier transform pair (dyadic Wiener-Khintchine theorem), and thus a second kind of short-time dacf and short-time Walsh energy spectrum are defined as the Walsh-Fourier transforms of the first kind. This leads to a meaningful and convenient Walsh transform pair between the first short-time Walsh energy spectrum and the second short-time dacf. The measurement procedures for both kinds of functions are discussed, and the mean values of these short-time functions are shown to be related to the corresponding long-time functions."
"This paper considers the problem of the detection of a binary phase-modulated carrier which has been transmitted along with noise through a hard-limiting repeater, corrupted by additional noise, and demodulated by cross correlation and sampling at the receiver. Three equivalent expressions are obtained for the error probability of the receiver output. Two of these expressions take the form of an infinite series involving either confluent hypergeometric functions or modified Bessel functions. A third form allows representation of the error probability in terms of Rice'sIefunction. In the special case where the signal-to-noise ratios\\rho_1^2and\\rho_2^2at the limiter and receiver inputs are equal, the error probability is simply \\begin{equation} P_e = \\frac{1}{2} \\exp (-p_1^2). \\end{equation} Asymptotic expressions for the error probability for large and small signal-to-noise ratios are also derived. The error probability is found to be smaller than that of a linear system for all practical values of limiter and receiver input signal-to-noise ratios. The optimum repeater non-linearity is investigated and is shown to be a limiter at such signal-to-noise ratios."
"A procedure is given for optimizing the sequential estimation of a random variable in the mean-square sense, with the constraint that the data must be summarized by a finite-valued statistic. This finite-valued statistic can be considered to be the memory of the processor. The estimate is constrained to be a function of the contents of the memory and the time of the estimate. An example is given to illustrate the results."
"This article treats the asymptotic theory of estimating a binomial parameterpwith time-invariant finite memory. The approach taken to this problem is as follows. A decision rule is a pair(t,a)in whichtfixes the transition function of a finite automaton, andais a vector of estimates ofp. Attention is restricted to automata whose transition functions allow transitions only between adjacent states. Rules(t,a)for whichtsatisfies this restriction are termed tridiagonal. For the class of prior distributions on [0,1] which have continuous density functions, we study the performance of a corresponding class of tridiagonal rules\\{ (t^{\\ast},a^{\\ast}) \\}relative to quadratic loss functions. These rules display sensitivity to the shape of the prior, and have the advantage that the Bayes estimatea^{\\ast}(givent^{\\ast}) is easily computed. Within the class of all tridiagonal rules, a particular rule(t^{\\ast},a^{\\ast})is shown, for memory size up to 30, to be locally admissible and minimax as well as locally Bayes with respect to the uniform prior."
"A class of finite-memory deterministic algorithms is introduced and investigated. Optimum algorithms are found for small numbers (up to 21) of states. The algorithms provide their own stopping rules."
"A television system is proposed which sends a succession of high-bandwidth and low-bandwidth pictures over a channel. If flicker is avoided, the eye judges picture quality from successive presentations of the pictures by taking an average. It appears that an exchange can be effected between the power in the high-frequency components and the actual duration of these components. Using only successive high-bandwidth and low-bandwidth pictures, a 1.5:1 compression ratio can be achieved, accompanied by a small drop in subjective quality. Using a \"high-frequency boost circuit\" to get a compression ratio up to 2.75:1 still gives satisfactory picture quality. Experiments using movie pictures in place of the previously mentioned stills show that high compression ratios are possible."
"A class of product codes for which an augmented syndrome can be defined is studied. By using this augmented syndrome, we are able to add new codewords to a product code while keeping the minimum distance fixed. In many cases the resulting code is as good as any known code. Decoders that may be simpler to implement than existing decoders are described for these augmented codes. It is also seen that in certain cases, by choosing not to correct a small number of correctable errors, significant simplifications in the decoder can be achieved. Finally, this augmentation technique is used in an example to generate a code of length 32 and minimum distance 8 with more codewords than any code previously known."
"In many communication channels noise disturbances occur in the form of low-density bursts. Codes capable of correcting multiple bursts of low density are efficient tools of error control for such channels. One such class of codes is presented ia this paper. This Class of codes can be decoded by simple majority logic. The approach is to use codes which are the duals of product codes whose component codes are majority-logic-decodable cyclic codes."
"A new class of cyclic multiple-error-correcting arithmetic codes is described, and the minimum distance of these codes is determined analytically. A two-step majority-logic decoding scheme is developed for these arithmetic codes. The new class of codes is extended to a new class of arithmetic codes having a primitive cyclotomic factor as the generator and anL-step majority-logic decoding scheme is developed for the extended class of codes."
"The problem of labeling the vertices of an undirected, connected graph with binaryn-tuple addresses is considered. These addresses are to have the property that if two vertices are a distancekapart in the graph then the Hamming distance between the corresponding addresses must bekdwheredis a positive integer which is constant for the graph. Not all graphs may be so addressed. A weak characterization of addressable graphs in terms of the eigenvalues of a certain matrix associated with the graph is given. It is shown that any addressable bipartite graph may always be addressed withd = 1. For nonbipartite addressable graphs,dmust be even, and it is shown that there exist graphs requiring an arbitrarily largedfor addressing. An addressing algorithm is given which is guaranteed to address any addressable graph."
"Goppa described a new class of linear noncyclic error-correcting codes in [1] and [2]. This paper is a summary of Goppa's work, which is not yet available in English.^1We prove the four most important properties of Goppa codes. 1) There existq-ary Goppa codes with lengths and redundancies comparable to BCH codes. For the same redundancy, the Goppa code is typically one digit longer. 2) All Goppa codes have an algebraic decoding algorithm which will correct up to a certain number of errors, comparable to half the designed distance of BCH codes. 3) For binary Goppa codes, the algebraic decoding algorithm assumes a special form. 4) Unlike primitive BCH codes, which are known to have actual distances asymptotically equal to their designed distances, long Goppa codes have actual minimum distances much greater than twice the number of errors, which are guaranteed to be correctable by the algebraic decoding algorithm. In fact, long irreducible Goppa codes asymptotically meet the Gilbert bound."
 "Some new lower bounds on the minimum distance of cyclic codes of composite length are presented. These bounds generalize some existing bounds and give better estimates of the minimum distance for a wide range of cyclic codes, Lower bounds on the random-error-correction capability of a particular class of cyclic codes of composite lengthn = n_1n_2, wheren_1andn_2are relatively prime, are easily derived."
"This paper surveys the literature on communication theory from 1968 to 1973. A large part of this literature, and of this paper, deals with digital communication through linear dispersive channels. Error rate bounds for pulse-amplitude modulation systems, the optimization of linear transmitters and receivers, and adaptive equalization are topics discussed initially. Important results from the literature on non-linear receivers are described next, including decision feedback, maximum-likelihood, and Viterbi algorithm approaches. New results on the conventional digital modulation formats of amplitude, phase, and frequency-shift keying are summarized. The paper concludes with sections describing the literature from this period on nonlinear and non-Gaussian problems, analog communication, and feedback communication."
"Universal coding is any asymptotically optimum method of block-to-block memoryless source coding for sources with unknown parameters. This paper considers noiseless coding for such sources, primarily in terms of variable-length coding, with performance measured as a function of the coding redundancy relative to the per-letter conditional source entropy given the unknown parameter. It is found that universal (i.e., zero redundancy) coding in a weighted sense is possible if and only if the per-letter average mutual information between the parameter space and the message space is zero. Universal coding is possible in a maximin sense if and only if the channel capacity between the two spaces is zero. Universal coding is possible in a minimax sense if and only if a probability mass function exists, independent of the unknown parameter, for which the relative entropy of the known conditional-probability mass-function is zero. Several examples are given to illustrate the ideas. Particular attention is given to sources that are stationary and ergodic for any fixed parameter although the whole ensemble is not. For such sources, weighted universal codes always exist if the alphabet is finite, or more generally if the entropy is finite. Minimax universal codes result if an additional entropy stability constraint is applied. A discussion of fixed-rate universal coding is also given briefly with performance measured by a probability of error."
"To improve the reliability of two-dimensional information, codes that can correct two-dimensional bursts (or spots) may be useful. In this paper a class of two-dimensional burst-correcting codes, called two-dimensional Fire codes, is proposed. The definition of these codes is a natural extension of that of the conventional Fire codes. The two-dimensional Fire code is a two-dimensional cyclic code designed for single two-dimensional burst correction. Several important properties such as the burst-correcting capability and the positions of the check symbols are presented. Also, encoding and decoding methods are presented. It is shown that the encoding and decoding are easily implemented by using two-dimensional feedback shift registers."
"A bound on the probability of error is obtained for anM-ary direct-detection optical communications system consisting of an amplitude-stabilized source, a lognormal atmospheric channel, and a photocounting detector array. Equal-energy, equiprobable, orthogonal signaling, and fiat independent fading at all detectors is assumed. The result reduces to that obtained previously in the absence of fading. A comparison is made with the analogous solution for the heterodyne array receiver."
"In obtaining a discrete set of data points to represent a signal, the problem of how to obtain sufficient information about the signal can become pronounced if the rate of obtaining samples of the signal is limited. The multiple-channel interpolation scheme presented in this correspondence uses periodic samples of the output of a set of prefilters excited by a deterministic input signal to reconstruct the original input signal. The input signals considered are band limited, and the sampling rate proposed is less than the Nyquist rate. This procedure may have applications in the analysis of transient signals."
"Bounds on the capacity of a class of digital communication channels are derived. Equating the bounds on capacity to rate-distortion functions of (typical) sources in turn produces bounds on the performance of a class of digital communication systems. For ratios of squared quantization level to noise variance much !ess than one, the power requirements for this class of digital communication systems are shown to be within approximately 3 dB of the theoretical optimum."
"We consider a class of strictly stationary binary sources\\{u_n, n \\geq 1\\}, characterized by joint conditional probability mass functions \\begin{equation} Q_n(U_n = k_n \\mid \\theta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\theta^{1-k_i} (1 - \\theta)^{k_i} \\end{equation} for alln \\geq 1, where\\thetais an r.v. on"
"The class of codes introduced by Goppa [1]-[3] includes the BCH codes as a proper subset. It also includes a large subset of asymptotically good codes, each of which has an algebraic decoding algorithm for correcting some smaller number of errors. In Section 7 of [1], Goppa gives necessary and sufficient conditions for his codes to be isomorphic to cyclic codes under a certain correspondence. In this correspondence, we exhibit another correspondence which reveals that certain other Goppa codes (including the example of Goppa's Section 6) become cyclic when extended by an overall parity check. In particular, the extended Goppa codes with(n,k,d) = (2^m + 1, 2^m - 2m, 6)are isomorphic to the reversible cyclic codes with check polynomial(x + 1)f(x), wheref(x)is an irreducible polynomial of period2^m + 1."
"By shortening certain binary primitive BCH codes, we derive a number of linear error-correcting codes with minimum distances superior to any known previously. We also give the weight spectra of three nonprimitive BCH codes whose minimum distances likewise constitute a significant improvement over those of the best codes previously known."
"In this correspondence we define a \"nonadjacent form\" for integers in an arbitrary radixr > 1. This form is proved to be unique, and the arithmetic weight of an integer is shown to be equal to the number of nonzero terms in the form. Two algorithms are presented for the computation of this form. Ifr = 2, our form coincides with the well-known modified binary nonadjacent form."
  "A quantum mechanical form of the Cramér-Rao inequality and a minimum-mcan-square-error quantum estimator for multiple parameters are derived, allowing all possible quantum measurements of the received field. The role of nonselfadjoint operators is emphasized in the formulation. Relations of our results to previous work on quantum estimation are discussed. For the estimation of complex mode amplitudes of coherent signals in Gaussian noise, it is shown that the optimal receiver measures the photon annihilation operator, which corresponds to optical heterodyning. This demonstrates the possible optimality of nonselfadjoint operators and clearly indicates the importance of considering more general quantum measurements in quantum signal detection."
"Recursive least-squares estimates for processes that can be generated from finite-dimensional linear systems are usually obtained via ann \\times nmatrix Riccati differential equation, wherenis the dimension of the state space. In general, this requires the solution ofn(n + 1)/2simultaneous nonlinear differential equations. For constant parameter systems, we present some new algorithms that in several cases require only the solution of less than2nporn(m + p)simultaneous nonlinear differential equations, wheremandpare the dimensions of the input and observation processes, respectively. These differential equations are said to be of Chandrasekhar type, because they are similar to certain equations introduced in 1948 by the astrophysicist S. Chandrasekhar, to solve finite-interval Wiener-Hopf equations arising in radiative transfer. Our algorithms yield the gain matrix for the Kalman filter directly without having to solve separately for the error-covariance matrix and potentially have other computational benefits. The simple method used to derive them also suggests various extensions, for example, to the solution of nonsymmetric Riccati equations."
"The doubly-compound hypothesis detection problem with finite-dimensional parameter vectors is treated in a general context. It is shown that estimation and detection occur simultaneously, with the detector using the a posteriori densities generated by two separate estimators, one for each hypothesis. No assumptions are made on the estimation criterion and very loose assumptions on the detection cfiterion. If sufficient statistics and hence natural conjugate densities exist for the unknown parameters, the procedure is quite tractable. In this case, the optimal detector partitions in such a way that the primary processing can be done without knowledge of the a priori parameter distributions."
 "In this, the first part of a two-part paper, we establish a theorem concerning the entropy of a certain sequence of binary random variables. In the sequel we will apply this result to the solution of three problems in multi-user communication, two of which have been open for some time. Specifically we show the following. LetXandYbe binary randomn-vectors, which are the input and output, respectively, of a binary symmetric channel with \"crossover\" probabilityp_0. LetH\\{X\\}andH\\{ Y\\}be the entropies ofXandY, respectively. Then \\begin{equation} \\begin{split} \\frac{1}{n} H\\{X\\} \\geq h(\\alpha_0), \\qquad 0 \\leq \\alpha_0 &\\leq 1, \\Rightarrow \\\\ \\qquad \\qquad \\&\\qquad \\frac{1}{n}H\\{Y\\} \\geq h(\\alpha_0(1 - p_0) + (1 - \\alpha_0)p_0) \\end{split} \\end{equation} whereh(\\lambda) = -\\lambda \\log \\lambda - (1 - \\lambda) \\log(l - \\lambda), 0 \\leq \\lambda \\leq 1."
"In this, the second part of a two-part paper, we apply the result of Part I [9] to three problems in multi-user communication. 1) For the special case of the broadcast channel where both channels are binary symmetric, we establish a converse result that shows the ad hoc scheme suggested by Cover and Bergmans [2], [3l is in fact optimal. 2) For a modified version of a source coding problem with side information of Slepian and Wolf [3], we establish a converse result. 3) We show that the \"common information\" of a certain pair of dependent random variables is zero."
"Any finite information source is given a graph structure, in which two vertices are adjacent whenever the two corresponding source letters are distinguishable by the coder-decoder pair. Usual sources correspond, therefore, to complete graphs. If the associated graph is not complete, however, an\\varepsilon-code for the source can be constructed in two steps: in the first, distinct codewords are given to distinguishable letters only; in the second step, a similar encoding is carried out for the complementary graph, in which distinguishable letters become indistinguishable and the converse. A particularly simple case shows up when nonadjacency is an equivalence relation among the vertices of the graph: each class of nondistinguishable letters can then be considered as a letter in a coarser source alphabet. The two-step procedure is then particularly intuitive. A problem arises when this procedure does not destroy optimality of the resulting\\varepsilon-code; some partial results are given in this direction. The results obtained are largely based on some graph-theoretical ideas and tools."

"Word currents in the batch fabricated THEMIS store are supplied by magnetic selection needles closely integrated with the storage elements. The selection needle behaves like the well-known switch core. The word current generated is a function of many parameters and tolerances because of interactions between the storage elements and selection needles. This paper discusses these interactions in detail and describes the needle-stack construction which led to well-defined word currents. It also gives results of full- and half-selection current measurements on two 256-plane stacks."
"Provides a histoey of the events leading to the Fifth International Colloquium on Magnetic Thin Films (Mt. Fuji Area, Japan, April 16-19, 1972)."
"Polycrystalline Eu1-xGdxS films (0 < x < 0.35 and x = 1; thickness is 40 to 600 nm) were prepared by electron-beam and flash evaporation onto heated substrates. The electrical and magnetic properties of these films were investigated through resistivity and hysteresis measurements at temperatures between 4 and 300 K, with a magnetic field, B, of 0.4 Tesla. After a short discussion of intrinsic differences between the electric and magnetic behavior of films and single crystals, the first results on I-V characteristics of isomorphic GdS-EuS-GdS film junctions are presented. With increasing x and/or lattice-defect concentration, the Curie temperature, TC(x), increases to about 150 K, while the magnetization Js(x), strongly decreases (extrapolating to Js=0 at x=0.5). Typical properties of the GdS-EuS-GdS junctions are the N-type I-V characteristics and the attributed current oscillations at T ≪ TC, the change to Ohmic I-V characteristics for T approaching TC, and the large negative magnetoresistance, ranging up to ΔR/R/ΔB = -10 T-1, at small B and T > TC, where ρ(T) passes a broad maximum."
"Thin films of EuS, prepared by electron beam evaporation, were investigated by Lorentz microscopy in a special low-temperature object stage. In the thermally demagnetized state of an isotropic film, a multidomain configuration is observed with the smallest detectable domain size being about 200 nm. In the ac-demagnetized state, the domain configuration is similar to the configuration during a magnetization reversal. The magnetization reversal in an isotropic film starts by nucleation of small domains at inhomogeneities in the film, mostly at the edges, and by the growth of the nuclei. The domain configuration is strongly influenced by mechanical stress. The mechanical stress has an effect on the magnetization reversal of EuS similar to a field-induced anisotropy in NiFe films. The walls in EuS films down to a film thickness of 7 nm are Bloch walls."
"Ni-Fe films in the composition range 60% to 90% Ni have been evaporated on glass substrates and epitaxially on"
"The static wall coercive force of thin ferromagnetic films has been calculated from a model of conservative wall energy. The spatial dependence of the wall energy γwis assumed to be given by the mean value of the local anisotropy energy, averaged over a coupling volume of the wall. The result of the calculation shows thatH_{w} \\propto \\frac{S}{M_{s}} (\\frac{D}{W})^{1/2} \\frac{1}{L}where the structure constantSincludes the local anisotropy,Dis the mean diameter of a region with constant anisotropy (for instance crystallites),Wis the wall width; andLis the coupling length parallel to the wall."
"Of late, the number of papers on magnetic surface states has greatly increased since the experimental detection of these states has been proven to open up a highly promising source of abundant data on the magnetic properties of materials. Spin wave resonance (SWR)-an effect observed in thin ferromagnetic films-is well adapted for such detection. In this paper, we are concerned with the theoretical conditions for surface mode detection in SWR. Since SWR depends essentially on the conditions existing on the surfaces of a film, we begin with a closer analysis of the concept of surface spin pinning. Next, resorting to the Surface Inhomogeneity Model (thin film, totally homogeneous within, but presenting arbitrary asymmetric conditions on its surfaces), we solve the problem of the existence of surface modes as a function of the pinning conditions, and discuss the essential features of these modes. Finally, we propose a criterion for identifying surface peaks in SWR spectra."
"It is possible to set up equations of the formB(H) = a_{0} + a_{1} e^{-\\alpha_{1}H} + a_{2} e^{-\\alpha_{2}H} + a_{3} e^{-\\alpha_{3}H} + a_{4} e^{-\\alpha_{4}H}on an analog computer to fit accurately aB-Hcurve of any magnetic material over the whole range from zero to the knee of the curve to the saturation part of the curve."
"Magnetic torque curves were measured in several specimens of polycrystalline"
"Magnetic accumulating core counters having large capacity and good linearity can be built by using the flux flyback in rectangular-hysteresis-loop cores for forming constant flux increments. Such counters can be used as analog memory and adaptive elements for building contactless controllable linear resistors with memory, etc. Their use in accumulating logical matrices for statistical processing of stochastic signals is considered."
"Thin-film uniform arrays (UA's) are general purpose, easy to produce, and reliable even when implementing complex logic functions. The use of controlled domain motion in narrow channels of low coercive force, formed in a high-coercive-force film, may serve as the basis for the implementation of large uniform programmable logic arrays with memory which feature information storage immune to power supply failures, and the simplicity of logic and control implementation. In this paper, principles of UA design are considered. Attention is given to performing logic operations using the controllable movement of magnetic domains in thin films."
"High-density thin-magnetic-film memory devices using double-layer storage films with NDRO properties were designed and tested. Use of the two double-layer films-one on the bottom and the other on the top of the bit-sense line-produced a structure that allows flux closure in such a way as to make possible a high-density film array. The devices tested were experimental arrays with densities of 4400 bits per cm2. Test results agreed well with those predicted from the theoretical model. Static measurements, as well as dynamic worst-case pulse tests for films and storage cells, were conducted, and the resulting signals and operating currents were determined."
"Determination of Joule magnetostriction by the method of tensile strain measurement has a lower limit of about 10-6because of error strains clue to magnetostatic forces and changes in temperature. It is shown that these disturbances can be eliminated by measuring shear strains induced in thin-walled tubes by helical magnetic fields. By a resonance method, the measurement of the magnetostriction constant can be made down to 10-13."
"Knowledge of the internal magnetization distributionsM(r)of polarizable media allows straightforward calculation of fields for any configuration which includes these media. Although useful calculations have been made using an assumedM(r), little work directed at calculatingM(r)has been done. This paper includes assumptions that, in addition to Maxwell's equations, are sufficient for determining the resultant integral equation. A method for the solution of this equation forM(r)is also presented. As an example, the nonuniform demagnetizing fields and magnetization distributions are calculated for cylinders of isotropic magnetic material. The results for these samples are compared with experimentally determined values and show average errors less than 9 percent forM(r)."

"A new compensating method for skew measurement in toristor-type cylindrical magnetic films is described. The state of the magnetization vector is scanned with a bipolar magnetic-field pulse and a compensating dc field is applied. Both the magnitude and direction of the skew are obtained."
"The magnetic field distribution in a cylindrical ferromagnetic conductor is determined for the case of a direct current flowing along the axis of the cylinder and a constant external magnetic field applied in a direction transverse to the current flow. The Gauss-Seidel iteration method is employed to obtain the vector potentials for different values of current and external field with the aid of a digital computer. The magnetic fields are then calculated from the resultant vector potentials. Calculations are carried out for currentI = 1.5A, radius of the cylindera = 2mm, and external magnetic fieldB_{0} = 0to 0.6 Wb/m2."
"The total core loss at 15 kG induction of different types of nonoriented lamination steel is described empirically as a single function of thickness, grain size, resistivity, and a quantity related to the preferred orientation of the material. This texture-related quantity is the induction at 30 oersted, B30, divided by the saturation induction, BS. In addition, a linear effect of oxygen content on core loss is described for a more restricted group of materials."
"An experimental investigation has been made of the dependence of the read-back signal on medium thickness and read transducer spacing for magnetic recording particulate disk file systems using saturation recording. The novel technique employed permits the study of the effects of transducer spacing and medium thickness without the need for changing either the medium specimen or the read transducer. For the ranges of transducer spacing (1.25-6.0 μm) and medium thickness (0.0- 1.75 μm) investigated, excellent agreement with theoretical predictions was found for peak signal amplitudes and half-pulsewidths of isolated pulses. It was also found that the -6 dB pulse packing density, calculated from half-pulsewidth measurements of isolated pulses, agrees well with experimental results."
"The effect of interactions on the saturation remanence of assemblies of identical, uniaxially anisotropic, single-domain particles is calculated using a spatial-mean interaction field. The particle easy-axis directions are assumed known and given by a distribution function. The remanence is determined by finding the magnetization orientation functional of the particle easy-axis orientation which minimizes the total assembly energy. Curves of remanence versus interaction strength (assembly packing fraction) are shown for a) randomly oriented assemblies of spherical particles with uniaxial crystalline anisotropy only, b) randomly oriented assemblies of acicular particles with shape anisotropy, and c) oriented assemblies of acicular particles with 6:1 aspect ratio. Disregarding external sample-shape demagnetization effects, this model always yields increased remanences due to interactions. A criterion is given which predicts when external shape effects are capable of dominating the net interaction field to yield a reduction in remanence. The applicability of these results and extensions of the theory are discussed in relation to particle assemblies in magnetic tape and high coercivity CoNiP films."
"The repulsive force between identical right-circular-cylindrical permanent magnets is calculated, and the ratio of this force to the weight of a magnet is maximized through optimization of magnet size and shape. It is assumed that the magnets are uniformly magnetized along their axes. For magnets of thicknesstand radiusR, separated by a distance2h, the optimum dimensions areR = 3.45handt = 2.7h. For these dimensions, the repulsive magnetic force has the value2.65 \\mu_{0}M^{2}h^{2}newtons, with the magnetizationMin At/m andhin meters."

"The design of the joints in a power transformer core has a marked influence on the efficiency of the core as a whole. Two experimental cores have been built such that the lengths of their 45° mitered overlaps could be varied from 0 to 2.0 cm. The larger core, with 1.0 m limbs, was used for investigating flux and loss variations and the second, smaller core was used to study how the results might be affected by changes in dimensions. For the larger core, the power loss was measured in two ways for a range of overlaps: first, using the localized power loss technique, and then by measuring the total power loss with a precision wattmeter. In both cases, a minimum power loss was found when the core was built with an overlap of 0.5 cm. The overlap length was varied in the smaller core and again a minimum power loss was found, but with a 1.0 cm overlap. A change in loss of over 20% was found for the range of overlap lengths used, and the optimum overlap length was independent of flux density over the range from 1.0 T to 1.8 T. The special flux distribution was determined from an array of search coils. The variations in flux distribution enables a qualitative explanation of the occurrence of the minimum in power loss."
"The capacity and limitations of fast random-access holographic memory are discussed. Capacities such 1011bits can be envisioned by superposition of holograms in a thick erasable storage material. The organization of the read-write holographic memory provides the possibility of varying the reference beam angle at any given point of the memory plane."
"The general features common to all rotating-sample magnetic measurements are described, and the governing equations are given. A number of cases of special interest are discussed in some detail: these include the measurement of magnetization as a function of field and temperature and the measurement of rotational hysteresis, various kinds of anisotropy, and magnetostriction. The concept of the rotating sample magnetometer is not new, but the method has greatly increased in practical value because of the development of the lock-in amplifier. The rotating-sample magnetometer method has many points of similarity to the vibrating-sample magnetometer. It is superior to the vibrating-sample magnetometer for some purposes, notably for anisotropy and magnetostriction measurements, and is generally simpler to construct."
"Progress made during the past years in the area of magnetooptic data storage by the computer industry has been most impressive. Many material media and physical phenomena have been developed for this particular application. It now appears that a large capacity (\\gsim 10^{10}bits) magnetooptic data store possessing major advantages over the conventional recording techniques could be developed. Of the many materials and techniques advanced to date, the use of thin films of MnBi for thermomagnetic writing, erasing, and magnetooptic reading has received particularly intensive study because of the many unique properties of this film medium. In order to provide an assessment of the potential of this medium for optical memory application, we have included in this review the pertinent material physical properties of MnBi; the memory characteristics in regard to read, write, and erase operation; the physical process involved in the writing and erasure by thermomagnetic technique; the technique for detection of written information; and the utilization of this medium for magnetic holographic storage. Emphasis is given to the material properties and physical phenomena, rather than the systems considerations in using MnBi films for optical memory."

"The design and operation of bubble circuits for mass memory applications processed through but a single mask level are presented. Control \"conductors\" are integrated within the propagate structure to effect generation, annihilation, transfer and replication. Several chevron expander detector designs are discussed including a curved guard rail detector as well as a nucleate generator in which the field threshold for domain nucleation is permanently lowered by a laser anneal. A memory organization featuring the replicate function is described."
"A 1024-bit bubble memory chip having a storage density of 1.5 × 106bits/in2has been designed, fabricated, and tested. The chip organization consists of two identical, independent, 512-bit major-minor-loop configurations. All device functions have been operated at the chip level at 500 kHz. The bubble chip has been mounted in a ceramic module assembly containing a sense amplifier chip, the in-plane field coils, and the permanent-magnet bias field. All device functions have been operated at the module level at 100 kHz, and the nonvolatility capability has been established."
"Large magnetic bubble circuits, having a capacity of 2 × 104bits and a storage density of 106/in2, have been fabricated on-the-chip by conductor-first processing using non-planar and planar processing approaches. Aluminum-copper and Ti/Au conductors have been examined with Al-Cu being preferable since it overcomes two major problems encountered when Ti/Au is used-resistance changes due to subsequent high temperature processing and adhesion of a P-glass dielectric which is used as a separating layer between the conductor and the Permalloy elements. When Ti/Au/Ti is used to improve adhesion of the dielectric layer, it is found that resistance changes are even larger than in Ti/Au. The use of intermediate layers of palladium does not alleviate the problem. High-speed operational testing reported elsewhere has demonstrated that non-planar processing results are equivalent to those obtained from planar processing. This is shown in scanning electron micrographs to be a result of achieving excellent step coverage where Permalloy elements overlap the conductor."
"Corrosion of magnetic films greatly affects the reliability of plated-wire memories. In plated films, additives in plating baths are codeposited onto films and affect the electrochemical state of the films. In this connection, a study was undertaken on the effects of thiourea and saccharin on corrosion. From current-potential curves and environmental tests it was found that the film deposited in a thiourea bath was easier to corrode than the film obtained from a saccharin bath. To protect the film from corrosion, a coating of Ni-P was made on it. This Ni-P coating was effective as an anticorrosive layer, but not to the required extent. Again when the wire was coated with a polyparaxylylen polymer on top of the Ni-P layer, no corrosion was found to occur. Moreover, no failure bit occurred from among the 6 × 104bits during the test of 30 cycles of MIL-STD-202D-106C."
"An island structure Ni-Co layer is deposited from a complexing bath containing glycine as a ligand agent. For multilayered films with this layer, it is shown that the Ni-Co islands are important to obtain a fluctuation of local anisotropy. Clear correlations are found among various parameters to evaluate memory characteristics of magnetic films. Especially, it is shown that it is possible to explain theoretically the correlation between write threshold and digit disturb threshold. The NDRO quality is strongly dependent on the fluctuation of local anisotropy. The island structure deposits are shown to be determined by a positively charged complex ion in the bath."
"In order to increase bit packing densities in plated-wire memories, their film thickness should be increased instead of being decreased. By laminating them with nonmagmetic intermediate layers, the total thickness of magnetic layers can be increased still preserving their characteristics. A contract flux keeper is useful for compensating for the increase of demagnetizing effects induced by the reduction of bit size and also by the increase of film thickness, but in order to reduce the bit size to below 0.4 mm its effective permeability has to be increased. The magnetization spread can be estimated by using adjacent disturb thresholds."
"The fabrication, construction and switching properties of an improved switching core are described. It is composed of electrodeposited Cr Permalloy film. The addition of Cr to electrodeposited NiFe film remarkably simultaneously reduces the eddy current effect, the anisotropy field, and the switching coefficient Sw, and improves the rectangularity. Thereby, a high-speed low-noise core is obtained. The cores are fabricated by the wrapping and slicing of the film. A typical core has an Swof 0.2 μs.Oe, a full-selected output current to half-selected output current ratio of 300 to 1000, and a threshold field of 1.2 Oe."
"Considerable structure has been found in the magnetization of spots written thermomagnetically on a film of MnAlGe by an impinging GaAs laser beam. Regions of the spot only 1 μm apart can exhibit strong, but opposing, remanence. We have investigated the effect of an external bias field on the behavior of different regions of the spot. From these experiments we show that the structure cannot be attributed either to local variations in film coercivity or to the fact that the magnetization reverses sign at a temperature well below the Curie point. These results support our previous conclusion that the effect is due to a demagnetizing field originating from within the spot during the writing process."
"Since the discovery of hard bubbles [1,2], several techniques for their suppression have been reported [3,4]. This paper describes a new double-layer method which is more versatile than previously reported suppression techniques. It is also shown that it may be possible to prevent hard bubble generation without resorting to exchange coupling of multi-layer films. This study has also produced interesting evidence that it is only the generation of hard bubbles that is suppressed, not their existence. The latter result indicates that the existing model of hard bubble suppression [5] is incomplete."
"This paper describes a new method in which normal bubbles and hard bubbles having arbitrary values of collapse field within a range allowable for a given sample can be produced merely by cutting straight strip domains with single-pulse currents applied to a pair of parallel strip conductors. When cuts are made along the inner edges of the conductor strips, normal bubbles result, while hard bubbles result when cuts are made along the outer edges. The collapse field of hard bubbles thus produced depends upon the orientation of the original straight strip domains with respect to the conductors. Moreover, the \"sense\" of hard bubbles is uniquely determined by whether the straight strip domains are tilted to the right or left of the perpendicular to the conductors before pulsing. An attempt is made to interpret the experimental results in terms of a mechanism in which a pulse field \"overdrives\" a domain wall to produce Bloch lines."
"A practical approach to packaging magnetic bubble devices is described. The aim of this package concept was to devise and maintain a nonvolatile bubble register, of low cost, low power consumption, and capable of being repaired easily. The package design incorporates existing techniques, manufacturing processes, and tooling. The criteria of nonvolatility is achieved with the use of permanent magnets and permalloy keepers which encompass the device package, Low cost and low power consumption are possible with the use of epoxy glass laminates containing etched drive coil configurations and I/O terminations. The magnetic devices contained within these laminations are accessed via module I/O pins. The product package, as compiled, features low inductance drive coils, uniform magnetic fields, low I/O noise levels, and a low physical profile. Thermal problems as well as shock and vibration problems have been minimized by the inherent design."
"A discussion is given of the consequences for the stability and behavior of bubbles and strip domains of an additional magnetic field which is parallel to the plane of the platelet. Apart from the instability of bubble domains, leading to a collapse or a running out into strip domains, a second kind of instability is discussed. This is due to the fact that inside a domain, the magnetization becomes unstable when a suitable in-plane field is applied and will be rotated to a direction parallel to the magnetization outside the domains."

"The attenuation of MSSWs versus frequency from 4 to 15 GHz and the effect of surface polish upon that attenuation is reported. Previous workers reported the observation of MSSWs on thick slabs of YIG at frequencies below 4 GHz and on thin films below 3 GHz. For the thin films and most slabs the losses were ∼ 100 dB/μs; in one case lower losses (54 dB/μs) in slabs at 4 GHz were obtained by chemically polishing the surfaces with hot phosphoric acid. We have employed a simpler technique which results in lower losses and allows 15 GHz MSSWs to be easily observed. We find that half of the observed loss is due to scattering from potentially removable volume pits."
"A read-write circuit for conductor-groove magnetic-bubble data storage loops has been tested which nucleates and destroys domains for writing and stretches domains along a thin Permalloy magnetoresistive element for detection. A small module the size of a 16-pin DIP package which can contain an 8 mm square garnet chip and bias magnet is described which could store 32-kbits if sixteen out of thirty-two 2-kbit storage loops on the chip are selectively connected. The organization of thirty-two such modules to make a megabit card is outlined. Circuit techniques are discussed which greatly reduce the effect of random propagation failures by rephasing the domain stream as it passes through the read/write area."
"The choice and organization of bubble-circuit functions in the design of a magnetic bubble mass memory chip are discussed with emphasis on factors such as circuit function compatibility and performance, circuit density, and processing simplicity. A specific major-minor organized chip design is described which uses rotating field driven propagation, $-sign transfer gates, all T-bar minor loops, a nucleate generator with chevron merging port, a chevron based replicator/ annihilator and a chevron guard rail expander detector. The overall operating characteristics of chips having 20 510 bits of storage capacity have been measured and a bias field margin of 12 Oe is typically obtained with a 25 Oe, 100 kHz rotating field."
"A review is presented on the research and development conducted in the past three years in Japan in the field of microwave ferrites. The review is divided into six topics as follows: a) circulators and isolators comprising conventional ferrites and garnets, b) polycrystalline CaVGs, their preparations, characterizations and applications, c) large size single crystalline YIGs and their application to circulators, d) conventional YIG materials tailored to digital phaser designs and fabrications, e) lithium ferrite and its applications, and f) highly anisotropic Ba and Sr ferrites tailored for millimeter-wave resonance isolators. The review is concluded with a forecast of future research activities in this area in Japan."
"Some recent developments and problems in the field of microwave ferrites will be reviewed. Properties which are considered interesting will be presented and discussed for materials with new chemical formulas in the spinel and garnet diagrams. Then we shall give an example of the physico-chemical problems brought up by the synthesis of ferrites with very low dielectric losses. Among the problems related to the micro-structure, materials with very small grains and those without porosity will be examined. The cation distribution between the crystallographic sites will be studied in another chapter. Then we shall try to discuss the experimental data available on microwave relaxation in polycrystalline ferrites. For that purpose, the effects of the relaxing ions and of the granular structure will be compared on\\DeltaH, \\DeltaH_{eff}and\\DeltaH_{k}."
"A model for the cross-tie wall is proposed which is based on parabolic coordinates. The model is also based on the experimental and theoretical work of several authors. The several parts of the wall are brought together and calculations are made. It is expected that the results obtained will be helpful in obtaining a complete solution on an analytical basis."
"A model describing quasi-static partial rotation and dynamic noncoherent rotation is presented and shown to agree with experiment. It is shown that, with applied field rise times longer than 1 ns, the ripple can be expected to relax in equilibrium with the rotating means magnetization. Magnetostatic stray fields prevent blocking from strongly affecting the rotational process and permit a stable ripple configuration even beyond the critical astroid. At a defined applied field threshold the inhomogeneous portion of the effective field from uniaxial anisotropy and applied field overcomes the stabilizing effects of the magnetostatic stray fields in alternate half-wavelengths of the ripple causing the magnetization there to switch through a large angle. The predicted large angle switching of the magnetization in alternate half wavelengths of the ripple is in good agreement with experimentally observed bands or stripes of reversed and unreversed magnetization both during quasi-static reversals in inverted Permalloy films and during dynamic non-coherent rotation with applied field rise times longer than 1 ns in normal Permalloy films. The model presents a reasonable fit to the field dependence of the angle between the observed stripes and the uniaxial anisotropy axis. Magnitudes of the local anisotropy causing the ripple are obtained from the fit to the data and shown to agree with the values determined by transverse susceptibility measurements."
"A calculation of the wall-motion response in thin films which combines Walker's dynamic theory with a conservative wall coercive force interaction has been done. The results are compared with recent wall motion data for Permalloy films. The comparison shows that the observed nonlinear response cannot be explained by these two factors alone. A more sophisticated analysis of wall motion in a conservative potential is needed. Relaxation effects may provide an alternate explanation of the nonlinear behavior."
"This investigation describes analytical and experimental results obtained on a broadband ferrite limiter at Kuband which utilizes a synchronously tuned waveguide bandpass structure. This device is aimed at providing protection for communications and electronic warfare systems over a bandwidth from 12 to 30 percent at Ku-band frequencies. The circuit consists of a series of three cavities in a waveguide transmission line, the coupling being accomplished via the irises or symmetrical inductive slits between cavities. Because of this cavity structure, the observed threshold power levels have been reduced by an order of magnitude. By utilizing a combination of single crystal YIG and lithium ferrite rods, the threshold power for limiting varies from 0.75 W at 16.0 GHz to 2.0 W at 17.0 GHz with an insertion loss of 0.9 dB."
"The influence of the steady magnetic fieldHon the peak-power handling capability of a junction circulator is studied. A similarity between the variation of the critical power Pc(measured on the circulator) and the critical field hc(measured in cavity) versus static magnetic field is observed. It is particularly attractive to apply a magnetic fieldHwhose value is near the limit magnetic field Hlimfor which nonlinear effects disappear. In this case the critical power is very high. In order to prevent the decrease of the magnetic field (delivered by the magnet) with increasing temperature, it is desirable to use samarium-cobalt magnets so that the magnetic fieldHis near the limit field Hlim. When the magnet is temperature unstable (for instance, barium ferrite) it is possible to achieve high peak-power performance at temperatures above room temperature with relaxing-ion-doped garnets but at the expense of higher insertion loss."
"Uniaxial ferromagnetic double layered films with a nonferromagnetic intermediate layer (Au) were investigated with a quasi-statically increasing reverse dc field. The directions of the mean magnetizations in the magnetic films of the sandwich system and in simultaneously evaporated single layered films were measured. Torques, caused by the coupling between the two magnetic films of the system, were observed. From these torques a coupling field was determined. In addition the micromagnetic theory of a magnetostatic coupling field is given. In this theory coupling is assumed to be caused by the ripple stray fields, which penetrate the intermediate layer of the system. The coupling field given by this model depends on the applied field. Its calculated value agrees quantitatively with the experiment."
"The figure of merit of magnetoresistive Permalloy thin films, which are commonly used for bubble domain sensors, is shown to improve considerably after annealing treatments. This improvement is caused by a lowering of the electrical resistivity, due to particle size and grain growth with activation energies of 0.70 ± 0.05 eV and 1.86 ± 0.15 eV, respectively. Comparisons indicate that thin permalloy films, which are deposited at 250°C and subsequently annealed, are superior as sensor materials to those deposited at 325°C."
"10 000 Å thick 80/20 Ni-Fe films were deposited bye-beam evaporation on oxidized silicon wafers in a magnetic field. The dependencies of the internal stresses and of the magnetic properties on the substrate temperature and on the deposition rate were investigated. Measurements were done in the as deposited state and after a 5 h easy-axis anneal at 400°C. It turned out that both the magnetic properties and the internal stresses were strongly dependent on the kinetics of deposition. The observed field-induced magnetic anisotropy is entirely contributed to pair ordering. No interdependence between the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and the internal stresses was found."
"This is the first report of the ferromagnetic resonance properties of thin single-crystal YIG films grown by liquid phase epitaxy techniques (LPE). The resonance linewidths of photoetched disks are close to that of bulk YIG for both parallel and perpendicular resonance without any annealing of the films. A new type of surface spin wave, localized at the air-film interface, is shown to exist in perpendicular resonance. The boundary conditions necessary for this surface spin wave to exist are produced either by SiO2sputtering or ion implantation."
"The ferromagnetic domain structure was studied in 3% Si-Fe single crystals during magnetization using the longitudinal Kerr effect and high speed cinematography. Large and variable wall spacings were observed during 60 Hz magnetization with no evidence of wall bowing in a crystal with perfect"
"In one assembly of gyros stray field from the hysteresis-motor stators had to be controlled. In addition, the motors had to achieve adequate starting and synchronizing torques. Power input, voltage and exciting current were also specified. Wide variations in system performance stemmed from variations in the rotor's hysteresis rings. These ring laminations were punched from P6 alloy, a modified 50/50 cobalt-iron alloy. Analysis of experimental results indicated the lack of control of alloy heat treatment as the source of trouble. Modified minor-loop properties were specified as well as a recommended heat treatment. These specifications now guarantee maximum starting and synchronizing torques associated with a minimum stray field."
"A method has been developed for determining the current time constant τ at which eddy currents become detrimental to electromagnet operation. Plots of flux densityBversus time, and currentIversus time were made for various values of τ on electromagnets having a constant air gap and a fixed value of maximum current Imin the coil. Such an electromagnet can be approximated by a linearRLcircuit as long as eddy current effects are negligible. τ was the time required for the current to reach 0.63 Im. This corresponds to the time constant in a linearRLcircuit. Values ofdB/dtwere measured at τ and the relationshipdB/dt = C/\\tau^{m}, wheremequals 1 andCis a constant, was found to be applicable for large values of τ, as expected in a linearRLcircuit. The τ value τcat whichmbegan to decrease from 1, determined the onset of eddy current effects since the circuit is no longer linear. Experimental results were compared to a theoretical solution for a ramp field applied to sheets of thickness δ. Calculations were performed of the time\\Deltatby which the flux density lags the applied field. Reasonably good correlation was obtained between\\Deltatand τc. Measurements were made on various soft magnetic materials in various thicknesses. The results provide a guide in selecting material and lamination thickness for a given application."
"Experimental procedures relevant to the growth of liquid phase epitaxial magnetic garnet films are discussed. These include substrate etching and cleaning, and techniques for obtaining uniform films with low densities of magnetic defects. A melt composition, designed to avoid the occurrence of orthoferrite or magnetoplumbite, is tabulated for the growth of Sm0.4Y2.6Ga1.2Fe3.8O12and a new melt preparation technique is described. The phenomenon of melt compositional \"drift\" is introduced and the contributing mechanisms are explained. Melt drift causes systematic changes in the properties of successive films grown from a single melt. An empirical melt control scheme has been developed to counteract the effects of drift so that more than 50 films have been grown from a single melt with their properties maintained within device specifications. Data from 1250 films grown using the melt control scheme have been collected and analyzed."
"The dependence of coercivity, resistivity and mechanical hardness on aging time and temperature was studied in solution treated and quenched 5 mil thick 82Co-12Fe-6Ti tape and related to changes in microstructure observed using transmission electron microscopy of thin foils. The results indicate that a fine scale periodic array of coherent precipitates is responsible for the increase in coercivity in this alloy in the solution treated, quenched, and aged state. This periodic coherent phase mixture must coarsen appreciably in order to produce a significant increase in coercivity, whereas mechanical hardness is significantly increased by the development of the modulated structure from the onset of precipitation."
"The rare-earth-free iron garnets of the system Y3-2xCa2xFe5-xVxO12have been studied to obtain a new bubble material which has a high domain wall mobility and stable temperature characteristics. The crystals were grown by the flux and LPE methods. It was, however, very difficult to grow large and high quality crystals. The bubble domains were observed both in the flux-grown crystal platelets and in LPE films. The domain wall mobility measured by the collapse method was 170 cm/s/Oe, which is not as high as the value expected. The temperature dependences of domain diameter and the collapse field were small up to about 70°C."
"A method of eliminating the external magnetic bias field necessary to sustain stable cylindrical magnetic domains (magnetic bubbles) is presented. This method uses double-layer garnet films. The films were grown on the (111) surface of Gd3Ga5O12 by the LPE method under different conditions for each film. There is an exchange coupling interaction across the interface of the double layer. This interaction acts as an effective magnetic bias field by which stable bubbles can be maintained without any additional external magnetic field. The largest effective bias field, approximately 19 Oe, was obtained for a double layer consisting of Y2.55Gd0.45Ga1.37Fe3.63O12 (upper film) and Y2.5Gd0.5Ga1.4Fe3.6O12 (lower film). Temperature characteristics of the internal bias effect and the relation between the normalized effective field and normalized film thickness are discussed. The bubble domains in the double layer films, when propagated by means of the usual permalloy T-bar patterns but with no external bias field, showed somewhat different operating margin characteristics from those of the bubbles in the usual single-layer garnet films."
"The ac biased and unbiased write processes in digital recording are compared using the Preisach diagram. Whereas differences occur at low densities, the high density Preisach representations become indistinguishable, provided that the same total write field is used for sharp digital transitions in a \"run-length-limited\" (Manchester, Miller) code. Since the output waveforms are then identical it follows that the same input-output relationships occur even when ac bias is not used."
"In high-density recording systems it is important to know the actual pulse shape as well as the validity of the use of superposition. Experimental results for these phenomena were obtained for thin oxide, thick oxide, and metallic disks, both as regards pulse shape and the validity of superposition."
"A principle is established for determining the extent of the self-demagnetized transition at equilibrium in nonsquare recording media, thereby generalizing the notion that the maximum demagnetizing field cannot exceed the coercivity. Data are presented showing that the second quadrant of the major hysteresis loop can be adequately modelled if the saturation remanence, coercivity and statistical \"squareness\" are known. A final arctangent distribution is phenomenologically assumed after self-demagnetization and the transition extent is found and tabulated as a function of media parameters."
"A previous analysis of the length of the isolated transition in digital magnetic recording, which used an analytical model of the write process, is extended to predict the output of the readback head for an alternating series of transitions with variable spacing, which is referred to as spatial frequency response. A convolution integral is derived which is used to calculate the spatial frequency response of a wide-pole-tip readback head to a series of arctangent transitions. For high densities it is found that the response is nearly sinusoidal and an analysis is given of the write process for sinusoidal magnetization, which is then also used to calculate spatial frequency response. The theoretical results are compared with experiments on chemically deposited magnetite films and agreement with the convolution integration is reasonable."
"The effect of rolling texture on both the elastic modulus and the temperature coefficient of the elastic modulus (TCE) in an age-hardenable Fe-Ni-Cr alloy was investigated. Experiments were conducted on cold-rolled and magnetized strips. Tuning forks which were machined from cold-rolled strip to have differently oriented rolling textures were also studied. Fifty percent cold-work was sufficient to produce a strong orientation effect, and, in addition, resulted in an uneven rolling texture over the cross section of the specimen. With an increasing degree of cold-work the elastic modulus and the texture sharpness increased, whereas the dependence of TCEon the texture orientation decreased. Young's Modulus still increased significantly when a magnetic field was applied to 90% cold-worked specimens. To suppress the ΔE-effect, degrees of cold-work greater than 90% are required."
"Static hysteresis and dynamic losses were characterized at 77 K for 0.21 mm thick polycrystalline gadolinium sheet having a predominant basal plane orientation with respect to the sheet rolling plane. Dynamic losses were separable into noninteracting hysteresis and eddy current losses, the static hysteresis losses making the major contribution to total losses at all frequencies (20-240 Hz) and inductions (1-2.5 T) investigated. Losses per cycle at inductions of 1. 1.5, and 2.0 T were linearly dependent on frequency with the intercept(s) atf = 0being correlated with measured static hysteresis losses per cycle."
"The purpose of this paper is to describe the technical advantages of integrated magnetic heads. This technology has been tested for use in two types of applications: magnetic tape and magnetic disk. Results relating to magnetic compatibility or \"media compatibility,\" definition, high-density feasibility, frequency bandwidths, and wear are presented for the two types of applications tested. It has been found that integrated heads produce a field gradient that is determined by the geometrical form of the head tips. Moreover, the field gradient does not depend on the applied magnetomotive force, which permits the optimization of a head on any given medium. The manufacturing possibilities of these heads and their advantages over conventional heads are discussed."
"The effective magnetic head-tape spacing was determined by fitting the measured tape-noise spectral density to the Wallace exponential spacing-loss function. The advantage of this approach over the customary method of measuring the spectrum of the recorded signal is that no corrections are necessary for recording or demagnetization losses. Calibration was done with a spacing shim; good experimental fit to a straight line was obtained in the semi-logarithmic plots."
"In the case of a rotating disc memory system with optical access, the effects of the rotating speed and of the depth of focus are investigated. It is shown that for high speeds and short pulse durations, the written bits are shifted with respect to their static position. A \"writing depth\" can be defined from the variations of the bit diameters versus the depth of focus. The threshold properties of the thermomagnetic writing allow this writing depth to increase by increasing the light spot diameter at constant bit size. The effect on reading of increasing the spot diameters is then studied and data on the high frequency modulation of the reading beam are shown. This kind of detection allows the attainment of data rates compatible with the existing memories, but with higher densities."
"The discovery of MnGaGe and GdCo, room-temperature magnetooptical materials, and their fabrication in thin-film form has led to experiments on high-areal-density high-data-rate optical storage of digital data. The results of read/write experiments using 77 K GaAs lasers will be presented and briefly discussed. Calculation of the ultimate performance in terms of areal density for a given signal-to-noise ratio as a function of material figure of merit, detector bandwidth, and detector quantum efficiency will be reviewed and discussed giving experimental data for MnGaGe and GdCo. This will be compared with predicted performance for conventional inductive magnetic recording."
"The effect of nuclear radiation on garnet film material parameters and bubble domain devices has been studied both during and after irradiation. The materials investigated include CVD grown Y3(FeGa)5O12, Er3(FeGa)5O12and LPE grown (YGdTm)3(FeGa)5O12films. The devices were different shift registers fabricated on ion implanted, non implanted and double layer YGdTmGaIG LPE films and GaErIG CVD films. Permanent damage on the material parameters caused by the irradiation were determined by measuring the4\\piM_{s}, \\sigma_{w}, l, \\mu_{w}, H_{c}, V_{s}and defect density before and after each irradiation, while the device performances were studied by comparing the propagation and annihilation margin and the detector signal. The irradiation sources included neutrons from a nuclear reactor and gamma rays from a Co60source. No significant Variation due to irradiation was found in any of the measurements for neutron irradiation up to 1015n/cm21 MeV equivalent and gamma irradiation up to 50 Mrads. Transient stability of information stored in a bubble memory was tested by writing information into different shift registers and then bombarding these registers with a high energy (∼1.5 McV) pulsed electron beam. The results indicate there is no loss of data for a dose rate of 104rads in a 30 ns pulse."
"The optimum design of linear inductors used in switching regulator circuits is outlined with regard to core and winding losses. It appears that tape wound toroidal cores with 36-48 percent Ni-Fe alloys (0.03-0.05 mm thick) with one air gap are well suited for these applications because of their small iron losses and their particularly wide range of dc biasing. Non-linear reactors are required in thyristor circuits as protective elements. Newly developed alloys (specially annealed 65 Ni-2.5 Mo-Fe and 79 Ni-4 Mo-Fe) exhibit particular advantages for these applications with respect to the excursion range of induction and the pulse permeability. For RFI suppression in SCR circuits, nonlinear chokes prove to be more effective than the hitherto existing solutions. Optimal results are realized with tape wound cores composed of several magnetic materials (e.g., 36 NiFe and 2.5 SiFe or 72-81 Ni-1-3 Mo-Fe and Fe). In particular, the acoustic noise levels produced by these chokes are considered."
"A family of five static dc-to-square-wave inverters, each employing a square-loop magnetic core in conjunction with two switching transistors, is analyzed using piecewise linear models for the nonlinear characteristics of the transistors, diodes, and saturable-core devices. Four of the inverters are analyzed in detail for the first time. These analyses show that, by proper choice of a frame of reference, each of the five quite differently appearing inverter circuits can be described by a common equivalent circuit. This equivalent circuit consists of a five-segment nonlinear resistor, a nonlinear saturable reactor, and a linear capacitor. Thus, by proper interpretation and identification of the parameters in the different circuits, the results of a detailed solution for one of the inverter circuits provide similar information and insight into the local and global behavior of each inverter in the family."
"In magnetic bubble technology, high speed operation in practical systems has been hampered by the lack of suitable coil designs for in-plane fields. These coils should produce 20-40 Oe per ampere, have uniform fields over a large area, have low inductances, and be practical to fabricate. A close-wrapped, large area multistrip line approach, with the large areas being separated by only tens of mils (≥30 mils), is proposed. The normalized data allow handbook-type designs of a large range of coil sizes. A model, design equations, field uniformity contours, and useful coil area plots are presented. Results calculated using probable fabrication tolerances show that uniform fields with a tolerance of ±5 percent can be provided over an area covering 70 percent of the coil and with field strengths up to 45 Oe per ampere. Inductances range from 200 nh to 10 μh for 1/4 to 2 1/4 inch wide coils."
"Presents the keynote address from this conference."
 "The basic properties of a new high Hcgamma ferric oxide (γ-HY) exhibiting coercive force as high as 450 ∼ 470 Oe were compared with those of conventional gamma ferric oxide (γ-LOP). The average axial ratio was 9 : 1 and the average number of pores was 0.2 per one particle for γ-HY. The pigment volume concentration was 15% increased and the gloss of tape surface 25% improved for γ-HY in the same tape formulation. The squareness ratio was 8% larger and the switching field distribution 25% narrower for γ-HY. The improved dispersibility and orientability were directly observed from the scanning electron micrograph for γ-HY tape."
"Evaporation of Fe and Co at a residual O2pressure of 10-5to 10-4Torr yielded magnetic films of high coercivities up to 500 Oe and magnetizations of about 1000 EMU/cm3. While the Co films were continuously deposited in the O2atmosphere, a sandwich structure of Fe and Fe2O3was formed by intermittently altering the evaporation conditions. Both kinds of films were produced in the same geometrical arrangement. The Fe/Fe2O3films showed shape anisotropy caused by the oblique incidence deposition, while no uniaxial anisotropy was observed on the Co films. For both, Co films and Fe/Fe2O3sandwich films, it was possible to adjust the magnetic properties within a certain range. In both cases the coercivity increased considerably by annealing at 200°C."
"We propose to use the stray field of a magnetic domain (e.g, a bubble) for magnetic recording. It is shown that these stray fields are large enough to write information into a conventional disc or tape. An experiment in which an audio signal is recorded on a conventional tape with the aid of a stripe domain is described. We consider the feasibility of an integrated recording head for \"one head per track recording\" by using a multitude of bubbles in one crystal plate as well as the possibility of realizing a scanning head for video recording. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate the feasibility of recording based on this new principle."
"Magnetic measurements on pseudobinary intermetallic compounds of the series R(MnxFe1-x)2(R = Y, Gd, Er) R6(MnxFe1-x)23(R = Y, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm) R2(FexCo1-x)17(R = Y, Gd, Dy) R2(FexNi1-x)17(R = Y, Gd) are reported. Magnetization and susceptibility measurements have been performed at temperatures from 4 K to 1500 K. The magnetic interactions between Mn and Fe are discussed in terms of a localized-moment model. In the case of the R2(FexM1-x)17(M = Co, Ni) compounds, a band model seems to be more appropriate. Mössbauer Fe57spectra obtained on the R2(Fe,Co)17series can be explained by a superposition of four different six-line patterns corresponding to the four crystallographically nonequivalent 3d sublattices."
"In situ observations of the domain structure of SmCo5under changing magnetic field conditions have been carried out with a high-voltage electron microscope. These observations demonstrate the existence of some pinning processes and suggest that while pinning at crystallographic defects may have some significance, that at grain boundaries may be more important. Such a view is supported by the apparent disregard of domain walls for the majority of crystallographic defects which penetrate the homogenized material and the pinning observed at a grain boundary."
"Modern intercity ground transportation requires such high speeds that novel means of suspension and propulsion must be developed. Wheelless trains driven by linear electric motors offer definite advantages with regard to passenger safety and comfort, reliability, efficiency, chemical and noise pollution. Projected densities of traffic may even render economical the transfer of energy from the wayside, by utilizing the mechanism of electromagnetic induction. Various realizations of linear synchronous motors, energized from either the vehicle side or the wayside, are considered, their relative merits, when compared with linear induction motors, are assessed, and the constraints which their peculiar operational and stability characteristics impose on the designer are highlighted. It is concluded that the structural complexity of the linear synchronous motor warrants an effort to make use of the same electromagnets for propulsion, suspension, and lateral guidance. Although sophisticated control systems may be needed, no basic obstacle appears to stand in the way toward the achievement of such a goal."
"Center containment and simultaneous support of rotating bodies by forces between two permanent magnets has become a technical reality due to high-coercive force magnets. The Self-Centering principle is described and experimental results are reported as examples for the advantages of the new arrangement over conventional magnetic bearings. Performance tests of prototype units are described concerning the damping conditions and the centering functions. Centering forces and supporting forces can be adjusted independently to meet changing requirements by positioning of the axle by an end bearing or by ac-forces. The actual forces measured for barium ferrite units are compared with the forces measured for samarium cobalt units. Typical values show the samarium cobalt units to be up to 25 times stronger (by weight) and up to 40 times better (per unit volume) than barium ferrite bearings, forces were measured in excess of 100 times the weight of the magnets. Analytical, computerized studies for the basic forces have been made for optimization and the design for combinations of many units for high stiffness requirements."
"As part of a continuing program to understand and optimize the magnetic behavior of Co-Fe-Cu-Ce permanent magnet alloys, we have made studies on the alloy system Co3.5Fe0.5CuCexwith x in the range 0.8 to 1.2. An alloy of x = 1 had previously been studied in detail and found to have good permanent magnet properties. In the present work, it was found that when x > 1, the coercive force was increased while both the Curie temperature and saturation magnetization were decreased. However when x < 1, the coercive force tends to decrease while the Curie temperature and saturation magnetization increase. The increase in coercive force with increase in cerium content can be accounted for largely by the decrease in saturation magnetization. These results are in accord with a domain wall pinning mechanism. Scanning electron microscopy studies have shown that a major second phase in the low cerium alloys is low in copper as compared with the matrix. On the contrary, the copper content of the second phase in the high cerium alloys is larger than that in the matrix."
"The precipitates responsible for magnetic age hardening of a Co3.8Cu0.9Fe0.5Ce alloy have been directly observed by transmission electron microscopy. The precipitates are coherent, plate shaped disks which possess the rhombohedral Co17Ce2structure. They form in a [001] plate normal orientation and cluster in staggered rows at\\sim 30\\degfrom the [001] axis. The development of precipitate microstructure has been examined in quenched, optimally aged, and overaged alloys. Direct evidence for interaction between the precipitate particles and magnetic domain walls has also been obtained. Among the recently developed Co5R based permanent magnets, the Cu containing alloys developed by Nesbitt et al. are of particular interest. These alloys are age hardenable; i.e., their magnetic properties may be improved and controlled by heat treatment. Previous work has revealed that their high coercivities may be attributed to the pinning of domain walls rather than to the nucleation of reverse domains. This report contains a description of some results obtained during an investigation of the alloy structures by transmission electron microscopy. We present direct evidence for the existence of coherent precipitates as well as for the existence of a pinning interaction between magnetic domain walls and the precipitate particles."
"Magnetic domains have been observed in NdCo5using an electro-etching technique. Electro-etching in an applied magnetic filed yields a surface record of the field related domain structure that can be viewed using a light microscope without polarizers. High contrast between oppositely magnetized domains can be obtained on surfaces both parallel and perpendicular to thecaxis. The effect of increasing the magnetic field to the point where circular or spike domains are obtained is shown and other etching variables are discussed"
"The Kerr magnetooptic effect has been used to observe the magnetization configuration in the layered magnetic elements of a magnetic recording device. The easy-axis disturb characteristics of partially saturated and fully saturated elements have been measured. The disturb threshold field increases markedly as the disturb pulse width is decreased. The disturb behavior of fully saturated elements can be correlated with flux reversal mechanisms which are observed in larger area single layer films. Partially saturated elements have significantly lower disturb thresholds. Methods of inhibiting the formation of these partially saturated elements are discussed."
"Nucleation of magnetic bubbles in the fields of a pulsed hairpin conductor is investigated experimentally and theoretically. It might be supposed that the current required for nucleation produces a vertical field in excess of the anisotropy field throughout the bubble film. We have found evidence that the current required is reduced because a) intense fields are required only at a surface of the bubble film, b) the horizontal field contributes in the initial surface reversal, and c) the surface of proton-implanted films is more easily reversed than the rest of the film. Field nucleation has been used to seed bubble generators and to generate bubbles controllably at 100 kHz."
"Tapes based on acicular iron particles give an outstanding recording performance compared to γ-Fe2O3and CrO2tapes. Especially in the short wavelength region the signal to noise ratio is, respectively, 12 and 7 dB better, whereas the bias noise level is somewhat lower. The iron tapes have a high coercivity, between 80 and90 \\times 10^{3}A/m, and hence the required bias is about 9 dB higher than for γ-Fe2O3. The print through properties are excellent."
"A vector magnetometer has been built utilizing then = 0, p = 1parametric resonance associated with zero-field level crossings in the optically pumped 23S1level of He4. The principles of operation are discussed and performance is described. The parametric resonance signal-to-noise ratio is 3.5 × 104in a 0.5 Hz noise bandwidth. The linewidth is 9.7 × 10-4G. Techniques for optimizing the sensitivity are discussed, and the sensitivity of the instrument is demonstrated by placing the sensor inside a superconducting magnetic shield and applying calibration signals, The peak-to-peak noise level is 1 × 10-8G. The use of parametric resonance instruments to measure interplanetary and geomagnetic fields is discussed."
"A measuring system is described which is capable of rapidly analyzing dynamic ac domain wall displacements monitored by Faraday photometric signals from bubble materials placed in a polarizing microscope. An audio modulated rf drive field used in conjunction with signal processing electronics produces a signal proportional to the derivativedx/dh_{p}of the displacement amplitude with respect to the peak drive field. This signal is the basis of plots produced automatically ofdx/dh_{p}versus frequency (10 kHz - 32 MHz),dx/dh_{p}versus hp, andxversus hp. Data obtained on an epitaxial garnet film of Eu0.7Y2.3Fe3.85Ga1.15O12are presented showing domain wall resonances and nonlinearities between wall velocity and drive field."
"Three techniques have been applied to the analysis of the field geometry of the Magneplane magnet. It is shown that the characteristics of the lift and drag forces can be clearly visualized when the field and the eddy currents in the guideway are decomposed into harmonics. The drag force is proportional to the in-phase portion of the eddy current while the lift force is proportional to the quadrature current. Contours of magnetic field strength and relative lift factor as functions of magnet geometry are given. A numerical analysis of the field in and around the magnets and their iron return path in which saturation is taken into account is reported. It is shown that the ratio of lift force to magnet weight is maximized when the iron is just thick enough to avoid saturation."
"Magnetometers have been placed on the moon by astronauts of the Apollo 12, 14, 15, and 16 missions. These instruments have measured permanent fields due to fossil magnetic material in the lunar crust and transient fields due to electrical eddy currents generated in the lunar interior. A stationary magnetometer which transmits data continuously was flown on each of the Apollo 12, 15, and 16 missions as part of a group of five geophysical instruments emplaced on the lunar surface by the astronauts. A portable magnetometer which was used to make discrete measurements at different points of the astronauts lunar traverse was flown on the Apollo 14 and 16 missions. All instruments measured magnetic fields intrinsic to the moon. In this paper we will discuss the properties of both the stationary and portable magnetometers used in the Apollo program to measure static and dynamic fields on the lunar surface."
"It is possible to improve the margins of propagation in field-access bubble memories considerably by a new arrangement of the Permalloy bars which constitute the propagation path. More slender bars of equal length become possible if the bars form an X-shaped pattern and the bubbles propagate at an angle of 45° with respect to the bars. U-turns and bubble gates have been designed and tested successfully as well. By using a 50 μm platelet of Sm-Tb-orthoferrite and bars 20 μm in width, propagation speeds up to 600 kbit/s could be obtained. This represents an improvement by a factor of two as compared with the propagation along a conventional Y-bar pattern, also tested. Below the critical frequency of propagation the field margins are improved when using the X-bar pattern. Some details of the bar fabrication are given."
"The evolution and characteristics of dollar-sign transfer gates for use in bubble mass memories are described. With this type of gate both directions of transfer require only a single conductor and unipolar current pulses. Directionality is achieved by the phase relationship between the transfer current pulse and the rotating field. It is shown that ordinarily the transfer function performs bidirectionally over the entire propagation range at current amplitudes of the order of 35 mA. Experiments on a 20 kbit chip indicate that over a range of rotating field between 25 and 35 Oe and a bias field range of 74 to 85.5 Oe, the worst-worst margins on the transfer current amplitude, phase and pulsewidth are ±14%, ±11° and ±23%, respectively."
"An exact analytical and numerical method has been elaborated for the complete determination of the propagating modes in a reduced size circular TE11waveguide partially or fully filled with a lossy axially magnetized ferrite rod below saturation. We are presenting some computed results at 17 GHz which allow for optimization of circularly polarized phasers such as Dual Mode Phasers or Polarization Insensitive Phasers (P.I.P.)."
"A general computer program, developed to calculate magnetic fields in the presence of ferromagnetic shields, solves the two-dimensional Laplace equation on a rectangular grid of up to 5000 nodes using the difference-equation technique. It may assume the magnetic inductionBto be either a linear or nonlinear function of field strengthH. Shielding material thickness for most applications is small compared to the difference equation grid resolution. Therefore, a resistor network analogy was used to appropriately modify the difference equation for thin materials on a uniform grid."
"Several hysteresis loop models are evaluated including the well-known arctangent and hyperbolic tangent models. Other models are derived from the normal statistical distribution. A general method of deriving hysteresis loop models is shown. When the different models are compared, it is seen that the hysteresis loops are different even though φm, (squareness), and Hcare the same. These three parameters are seen not sufficient to characterize a hysteresis loop, and at least one other parameter is needed. The pulsewidth of the differentiated loop is sensitive to small changes in loop shape, and a suggested fourth descriptive parameter is W, the half-height width of the differentiated loop. This parameter is more useful if it is reduced by the coercive force Hc. The several models are compared to actual hysteresis loops of various materials (powdered media, tapes, transformer laminations, etc.) and choices are made for applicability in each case. Only one of the models, the arctangent model, is useful for the purpose for which they were derived. Others should be adequate for reactor-transformer theory and magnetic amplifier theory, but of limited use in magnetic recording theory. To make them more functional as models, a natural way of deriving minor loops from the major loop is indicated."
"The structure of the film element used in the magnetic matrix recorder is described. The amplitude resolution is proportional to the digit margin, the ratio of digit current required to disturb to that required to write. An experimental curve of this parameter versus film thickness is given. Experimental curves of time response of the recording element are presented. The differential equation for the behavior of the magnetization in a thin film recording element is solved for several cases of interest; the time resolution (the smallest time between a small signal of one polarity and a large signal of the other such that the recorder does not make a mistake on the small signal) is given as a function of the anisotropy of the film and the applied hard axis field before and during the measurement. The resolution time is inversely proportional to the square root of the sum of the anisotropy field and the applied hard axis restoring field; time resolutions range from 1.4 ns for a permalloy film with an Hkof 3 Oe to 0.15 ns for a cobalt film with an Hkof 48 Oe or a permalloy film in which a large hard axis restoring pulse is used. This corresponds to an errorless frequency response of 350 MHz and 3330 MHz, respectively."
"The working principle of the Magnetic Matrix Recorder is one of hard-axis fall-back. While the relaxation time may be several nanoseconds, the commitment time is a fraction of a nanosecond. The recorder sampling time is thus tens of picoseconds, allowing a gigahertz response at a low resolution, or 100 MHz response at 6-bit (1.6 percent) resolution. A 1 ns rise-and-fall-time pulse was demonstrated in a 10 level matrix recording. The Mated-Film cores in the matrix presently allow expansion to 100 levels (6 1/2 bits) or 1000 levels (10 bits) if calibrated. Presently, a severe limitation exists in time coverage due to the degradation of the analog signal along the bit line. The required low-dispersive Permalloy has only been obtained on a rather thin bit line, making the line resistive and dispersive to the signal. To minimize signal path length, the bit lines are fed in parallel. The number of quantizing levels, resolution, may thus be limited by available signal current. The performance limiting factor is not the Mated-Film core, but the conductor."
"This paper begins with a review of previously published work on film recording heads and then reports on write-read experiments with single-turn film heads at a medium velocity of 40 m/s (1575 in/s). A typical film head is compared to a conventional ferrite head with regard to readback pulse shape, transition-density response, and efficiency. The results are in agreement with theoretical predictions."
"A single-transient recorder is currently being developed which allows automatic computer-compatible acquisition of high-speed signals. The heart of the system is a matrix of thin-film magnetic elements which is used to digitize and record the data. The present system samples at 5-ns intervals with six bits of resolution, is small in size, and can be operated in a fully automatic mode. One of the main recorder design considerations is the disturb current limit of the elements. This has been found to be a function of the recorded state as well as the width of the disturb pulse. The results of this project indicate that improvement of the matrix will be necessary for full utilization of the magnetic-matrix recording technique."
"The first magnetocardiogram was published one decade ago. Subsequent development of magnetocardiography is discussed, including experimental techniques, theoretical aspects, and clinical significance. The heart is modelled by 20 current dipoles in a homogeneous conducting sphere. Electric and magnetic scalar potentials at the surface of the sphere are calculated. These data, perturbed by noise, are used to solve the inverse problem, i.e., to determine the moments of the multiple dipole array which would generate the external potentials. The accuracy of the inverse solution is improved when a combination of electric and magnetic data are used rather than electric data alone."
"To study the biological function of hemoproteins, the electronic state of the central iron ion was determined by means of magnetic measurements. The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility, the field dependence of the magnetization (paramagnetic saturation) under a high magnetic field of a superconducting magnet and the torque of a single crystal were studied. The analysis of the data was made on the basis of the ligand field theory, and the electronic state of the central iron ion was determined. In the case of hemoglobin, binding of O2to the heme is studied by the Hietler-London calculation with the three ionic structures Fe2+-O2, Fe3+-O2-, Fe+-O2+. Hamiltonian matrix elements are evaluated by the method of \"Atoms in a Molecule\". It is shown from the calculation that one of the triplet-triplet binding states of heme-O2becomes the lowest in energy at a distance of about 1.5 Å."
"An investigation of as-grown and annealed films of the GdyY3-yFe5-xGaxO12family of bubble garnet films is reported. Measurement of film parameters important for magnetic bubble devices were made, including: characteristic length, saturation magnetization, mobility, coercivity, anisotropy field, transition temperatures, and temperature coefficients. The stress-induced anisotropy of uncracked films was found to increase monotonically with room-temperature lattice mismatch. However, the data suggest there is an in-plane component of anisotropy which is probably growth induced. The primary effect of annealing at 1200°C is to redistribute gallium ions among the tetrahedral and octahedral sites of the garnet lattice, resulting in lower compensation temperatures and changes in lattice parameter and magnetization."
"Core gaps are used in the magnetic shunt paths of current-limiting transformers to limit secondary current under short-circuit conditions. It is shown here that for short-circuit current limited to twice normal a current limiting transformer has only 55% of the rating of a noncurrent-limiting transformer of the same physical size. Part of the reduction in rating stems from the space required for magnetic shunts, part from the greater space needed for winding insulation, and part from the increased loss due to the gaps. Reliability of a previously tested gap-loss equation is established, and design examples are given for both stamped laminations and strip-wound cores."
"The technique of ion-beam milling is applied to the structuring of garnet layers. Rf-sputtered titanium is found to be an appropriate masking material as its sputter etch rate is small and almost independent from the angle of incidence of the ion beam. In contrast, the garnet has a prominent etch rate angular dependence. The optimal conditions for the generation of grooves in garnet layers, masked by rf-sputtered Ti, are reported. By applying this technique, a well-resolved mosaic pattern of 20 μm periodicity and 5.5 μm depth has been formed in an LPE iron garnet film of 5 μm thickness."

"When a laser beam is focused to a spot on a MnBi single crystal or a polycrystalline MnBi film, a domain wall is nucleated which propagates from the heated spot by various mechanisms dependent on the direction of magnetization, the process of the crystal growth, and the effect of the adjacent crystal. The mechanism of the propagation can be interpreted by strip and bubble-domain theory. It is expected that the crystallographic and magnetic properties of films or crystals can be microscopically investigated by this heating method. The condition for stable writing according to bubble theory indicate that a stable spot can be written in a homogeneous and oriented MnBi film of thickness between 200 and 500 Å. This condition was experimentally confirmed."
"A theory of thermally activated domain wall motion is presented in which attention is focused on the functional form of the domain wall energy variation in the direction of motion. It is shown that in general the activation volume is magnetic field dependent, and not necessarily constant, as is often assumed. A simple power law form of the wall energy variation, due to sample inhomogeneities, is found to exhibit a ln (wall veiocity) against field slope which decreases with decreasing temperature as is observed in thin films. The usual assumption of a constant activation volume predicts a slope which increases as the temperature falls."
"A flexible low cost multiclass memory system has been evaluated and constructed to accommodate memory sizes from 128 000 to 4 000 000 ten-bit bytes. For 1.2 to 1.5 μs cycle time memory modules, typical system cycle times range from 0.25 to 0.40 μs. Provision is made for conveniently varying the block size, the number of blocks per class, and the number of classes. An efficient directory and update list are achieved in the multiclass system by a high-speed segmented memory using memory cells with half the access time of the buffer memory. The directory and update list for any class are accessed by simultaneously reading all segments. Comparison and list manipulation circuitry is shared by all classes. A cost evaluation shows that at the present state of technology, the buffer increases the cost of a 500 000 byte memory by about 8% while decreasing the effective cycle time by a factor of three."
"This paper describes the effects on Faraday rotation and optical absorption of substituting bismuth into various single crystal iron garnets. The large negative contribution to the Faraday rotation produced by the presence of bismuth is of the diamagnetic form and is associated with an optical transition around 415 nm. The magnitude of the bismuth contribution depends on the concentrations of bismuth and tetrahedrally coordinated Fe3+ions, suggesting that both these ions are involved in the transition responsible for the additional rotation. The absorption arising from the bismuth increases with decreasing wavelengths. However, the increase in magnitude of the rotation is such that the figure of merit is increased above that of YIG, peaking at 560 nm with a value of 5.2 deg/dB. The Faraday rotation and figure of merit of low magnetization garnets, suitable for magnetooptic devices, are also increased in the visible by the presence of bismuth."
"Recently, several medical applications have been proposed for magnetic fluids. These applications, which are reviewed here, involve introduction of magnetic fluids into the blood with subsequent magnetic guidance or magnetic detection by external devices. The issues associated with achieving magnetic guidance and minimizing toxicity are considered. The technical difficulties involved in any of the proposed applications are substantial, and would appear to outweigh the potential advantages at the present time. However, the research and development efforts in this area have been very limited and, therefore, the opportunities for innovation and further progress are significant."
"A single-phase transverse-field bubble propogating circuit is discussed. Bar shape difference, with corresponding demagnetizing factor difference, is used to convert alternating applied field into a travelling magnetic wave. A computer analysis was carried out using a simplified model for the Permalloy magnetization process. Good agreement is achieved between these predictions and experimental observations."
"High gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) makes possible the efficient separation of very weakly magnetic particles of micron size for which conventional magnetic separators are ineffective. Filamentary ferromagnetic materials placed in large (10 kOe) background fields are used to obtain large surface areas of high field gradients. Potential applications in mineral processing and pollution are numerous. This paper discusses the principles of HGMS and the results of some experiments designed to determine the dependence of the separation efficiency on the adjustable parameters of such a device."
"The structure of SmCo5has been investigated between 500°C and its melting point. It is found that SmCo5is a composite of two phases. One of them is unstable and decomposes below 1150°C giving rise to the neighboring phase Sm2Co17. No traces of Sm2Co7have been observed during this decomposition. The reaction of SmCo5with the container materials is discussed. The potential importance of RCo5compounds of the CaZn5- type structure for the manufacture of permanent magnets has resulted in intensive research on these materials. These materials have extremely high energy products and coercive fields. Several reports on the structure and stability of SmCo5have been presented in recent years. On the basis of measurements of the coercive field, Westendorp [1,2] concludes that SmCo5is a single phase above 1080°C and below this temperature a second phase precipitates out. The size of the particles of this precipitated phase controls the coercive field. Den Broeder et al. [3] and Buschow [4] have reported a eutectoid decomposition of SmCo5at about 750°C (SmCo5= Sm2Co7+ Sm2Co17). Although they detect the presence of Sm2Co7and Sm2Co17by metallographic methods, they are unable to find any traces of Sm2Co7by X-ray diffraction techniques. In this paper we report on the structure and stability of SmCo5at various temperatures and its reaction with various container materials."
"This work is probably the first systematic attempt at using high gradient magnetic separation techniques in coal slurries. The rationale for magnetic desulfurization of coal resides in the paramagnetism of pyrites and their liberation from the coal substance. Principles of magnetic separation are discussed. A model based on the balance of forces acting on a particle in the vicinity of a magnetized strand is developed. The experimental separator consisted of a laboratory column, packed with either steel wool or screens, inserted in the bore of a solenoid magnet. Experimental results, confirmed the effects of coal particle size and slurry velocity as predicted by the model. Evidence of magnetic action was obtained from the magnetization curves of the coal minerals in the products of separation. Preliminary economic analysis shows promise for the commercial application of the process. Directions for future research are indicated."
"The changes in composition of NiFe for a change in flow, temperature, or current in the NiFe electrolyte are determined. The local uniformity of composition is controlled by varying these coefficients of composition through changes in the Ni++concentration and temperature of deposition. At low concentrations of Ni++and low temperatures, it is concluded that a local, or short-term, fluctuation in flow is the principal factor affecting the uniformity of the NiFe composition deposited, At higher Ni++concentrations the temperature fluctuations become the principal factor affecting the uniformity. The trends in magnetic properties and memory quality are also related t o t h e Ni++concentration and temperature of deposition. These trends are interpreted in terms of the model previously described for the origin of the nondestructive read-out properties of plated wire."
"An experimental magnetic bubble mass memory design is reported. The goal of this project has been to examine the technical feasibility of organizing a multiplicity of chips into a modular design and to learn some of the problems. The module consists of four ceramic substrates, each of which can mount from 1 to 14 chips of up to 20 kbit capacity. 1 to 4 of these populated substrates can be placed into a common drive coil-bias field magnet assembly. The module organization and timing is described and data obtained from the operation of 20 kbit chips at 112 kHz rotating field is given."
"Pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance has been used to differentiate between normal mouse tail tissue and a malignant transplanted melanoma S91 located on the tail of a live mouse. Measurements of proton spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation serve to detect and monitor the tumor growth. The mature tumor exhibits a spin-lattice relaxation time T1of\\sim0.7- 0.8s contrasting with the corresponding normal tail tissue T1of half this value. On the other hand spin-spin relaxation in normal tissue cannot be characterized by a single relaxation time T2. The corresponding relaxation in a mature tumor is found to be closer to a single exponential but still requires at least two superimposed exponential decays."
"The degree of preferred orientation in magnetic recording tape was investigated by an X-ray pole figure technique and by measuring magnetic properties. Acicular γFe2O3particles dispersed in PVA film were oriented by mechanical stretching and magnetic orientation. The pole figures of these samples indicated the texture with [110] to the orientating direction. The degree of orientation in stretched film was much higher than in magnetically oriented film. Further, it was observed that the particles tend to align uniaxially in mechanical orientation, and biaxially in magnetic orientation."
"Demagnetization curves were recorded for composites of 1) Co5Sm and Lodex, 2) Co5Sm and lead, and 3) two different Co5Sm powders of widely different Hcivalues. \"Kinks\" observed for the first and third composites but not the second show that the effect results from the difference in Hci. The Co5Sm-Lodex composites produced \"kinks\" in only the 20-80 wt % Lodex range. Significant improvement of energy product in Lodex composites requires more than 70 wt % of Co5Sm. Better results can be obtained by diluting Co5Sm with lead. For applications operating at high load lines and requiring high inductions, improved properties may be obtained by small additions of Co5Sm to Lodex. Energy product and Hcican be improved for Co5Sm-lead composites by zinc coating the magnetic particles prior to pressing. One sample producedBH_{\\max}values of 7.5 MGOe and Hciof 13.5 kOe."
"The use of peak-to-peak values in describing output noise of a magnetometer or low frequency amplifier is of questionable value for certain applications. A more precise statement of instrument noise is made with a plot of the noise power spectral density versus frequency. The spectral density plot provides a rich source of information which can be used in the selection and testing of such instrumentation."
"The fluxgate magnetometer, which has been used for many years in the measurement of dc or low frequency magnetic fields, may also be adapted to the quantitative measurement of magnetic field impulses of short duration. The impulse is effectively stored in the sensor and read out during one or more excitation periods. This storage is accomplished by means of a shorted coil of suitable time constant wound around the sensor core. A possible application is the location and measurement of the amount of charge transfer in lightning flashes."
"A magnetic separator featuring high magnetic field values, high field gradients, and large flow capacity has been applied to problems in mineral beneficiation. The major effort has been spent on taconite iron ores. The background of this ore beneficiation problem is discussed along with a discussion of the prior art of magnetic separation. In cooperation with industry and mining companies, oxidized and semitaconite ores have been separated and the characteristics of the process studied. Recovery as a function of magnetic field and grade versus flow rate plots are shown as well as some typical grade-recovery curves. The ability of the separator to treat very small particles of \"nonmagnetic\" minerals is discussed."
"This paper presents procedures for designing the transformer for a two-winding energy-storage dc-to-dc power converter in which the power transistor is pulsewidth modulated by means of a constant-frequency type of controller. The presence of the second winding provides an additional degree of freedom in the design procedures beyond those for single-winding converters and leads to a number of design options for achieving specific performance characteristics. Ten options are provided: four relate to conditions that may be imposed on the duty cycle, four to maximum stress on the semiconductors, and two to the transformer turns. The design algorithm has been implemented in a computer program to automate the design procedures and to provide an evaluation of the converter circuit for each of the transformer designs."
"Magnetic separation as applied to waterborne contaminants is successful in reducing the solids content of a water sample and in removing the dissolved orthophosphate from the aqueous slurry. The contaminants are chemically associated with a magnetic seeding material, and subsequent removal of this seed sweeps the pollutants from the system. The advantage of this form of treatment over conventional techniques is the high speed and large handling capacity of a magnetic filtering device. Flow rates in laboratory scale tests of 50 to 150 gallons per minute per square foot are common, and higher slurry flow is possible. This represents nearly an order of magnitude improvement over the processing speed of present filtration machinery."
"Reasons for, and the character of, deviations from the \"superposition\" principle which is customarily used in considerations about digital magnetic recording are analyzed. First, a treatment is presented which is based on the Preisach model and ignores the demagnetizing field. It is shown that superposition is inconsistent with the Preisach model but that, when more than two transitions are involved, a weaker form of the superposition principle can be derived from the Preisach model. Next, the effects produced by the demagnetizing field in the medium are illustrated by results of a \"self-consistent\" computation for a thin layer. Finally, some experimental results obtained from a large-scale simulation model are presented."
"We have developed thyristor chopper equipment which is controlled by magnetic phase shifters as the speed control equipment of a battery locomotive for the Seikan Undersea Tunnel. The main feature of this equipment is adoption of a balanced half-wave type magnetic phase shifter, having high reliability together with many functions, in a simple structure to the thyristor gate control. Special consideration was given to the smooth control characteristics at around the minimum and maximum points of the chopper output voltage. This construction of equipment received special consideration regarding its ability to withstand severe working conditions. Satisfactory results were obtained in various performance and reliability tests, and locomotives supplied with this equipment are already operating in excellent condition."
"A method for magnetocardiographic investigation is presented according to the following: 1) development of integral equations for electric potential and magnetic field generated by current sources within an inhomogeneous volume conductor, and 2) description of a numerical algorithm to solve these equations. This method was developed specifically for an inhomogeneous torso-shaped volume conductor containing an autonomic model which dynamically simulates the electrical activity of the heart; thus, numerical simulation of electrocardiograms and magnetocardiograms for different pathological heart conditions is possible."
"The parameters of magnetic force, radio-opacity, biocompatability and ease of machining were examined with regard to selecting magnetic materials for use in permanently implanted medical systems. AlNiCo 5, PtCo and SmCo were considered. PtCo was found to be the most suitable. Depending upon theL/Dratio of cylindrical magnets, SmCo or AlNiCo 5 develops the greatest force."
"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals were recorded from ordinary tap water 12 s after the fluid was magnetized upstream of the detector. Detection time was extended to 18 s with signal averaging. The time for a bolus of magnetized water to reach the NMR detector was varied. Based on the measured signal amplitude, a relaxation time T1of approximately 2.5 s was graphically determined. Since the NMR signal was detected after 7 time constants, these findings suggest that NMR tag-detect systems are useful over distances involving several time constants, such as those encountered in the measurement of blood flow in biological systems. These findings are similar to the previously published studies of Kudravcev and Bowman. Measurements of the T1of human blood indicate that T1is dependent on the degree of oxygenation of the blood."
"Curie-point writing on MnBi films with a focused laser beam provides a means of substantially improving the packing density of magnetic recording. The MnBi film, however, has two crystallographic phases with different Curie temperatures. This causes the laser power requirement for writing to become a function of the operating history of the data bit location. Fortunately, the normal room-temperature phase has a higher laser power requirement than the quenched or mixed phase compositions. Therefore, the initial conditions for writing are suffieient for any subsequent condition. The time constants for these trasformations and the resulting optical memory characteristics have been observed and measured. Long-term operational lifetime has also been examined. The results show that when the laser writing power is 10% above writing threshold, the readout signal remains constant indefinitely; whereas when the writing laser power is more than 20% above the threshold value, continual degradation occurs. These experiments further confirm MnBi as a practical magneto-optic storage medium."
"The purpose of this work is to determine the phases present in liquid-phase sintered Co5Sm magnets. Specimens sintered at 1100°C and given subsequent thermal treatments were examined by optical metallography, electron microprobe, and X-ray diffraction techniques. The results of this work suggest that these materials do not exhibit an equilibrium configuration of phases."
"A simple model involving two types of nuclei, neither with any unusual or unsymmetrical properties, can describe a large variety of phenomena related to the field dependence of coercive force in powders and nucleating fields in single particles of high-anisotropy materials, including orthoferrites and hexagonal oxides as well as cobalt-rare-earths. One type of nucleus is a domain wall trap that is activated by capturing a fragment of moving wall. The other type is any local disturbance that provides a reversal site by its interaction with the local magnetization. Together they permit reasonable quantitative predictions of a number of types of behavior that have been observed."
"The magnetic properties of single crystals of SmCo5have been studied. The spontaneous magnetization was 894 emu/cm3at room temperature. The process of magnetization reversal was extremely sensitive to the surface condition. The magnetization reversal process for spheres with rough surfaces was dominated by free wall motion, while the magnetization for spheres with the smoothest surfaces reversed by means of a jump from the completely magnetized state to the completely reversed state. These latter spheres had an energy product equal to the limiting value of(BH)_{\\max} = 31.6MGOe. Some preliminary data for NdCo5and YCo5are also presented."
"The purpose of this work was to study the effect of different quenching rates from 900°C on the magnetic properties of liquid-phase sintered Co5Sm magnets. Various fluids with different thermal conductivities were used to achieve different cooling rates. Interpretations of this behavior were warranted in terms of the microstructures and chemical compositions of the samples examined. The results of this work indicate that the magnetic properties of Co5Sm magnets are strongly dependent on the particular cooling rate used to come from 900°C to room temperature."
"Thin films of Y2.7Bi0.3Fe3.8Ga1.2O12have been grown on {111} -oriented Gd3Ga5O12single-crystal substrates by isothermal liquid-phase epitaxy using Bi2O3-PbO-B2O3flux. Serpentine-like domains and, under the application of a bias field, bubble domains were observed in the films to have optically high contrast, which originates from an anomously large Faraday rotation caused by bismuth substitution. The sign of the Faraday rotation of the films was negative. The magnitude was 2 to 10 times larger than that of Y3Fe3.8Ga1.2O12in the wavelength region between 0.5 and 0.8 μm. The absorption coefficient of the films was a little larger than that of Y3Fe5O12in the wavelength region below 0.5 μm. The domain wall velocity of the films versus applied field was nearly the same as that of Y3Fe3.8Ga1.2O12films."
"A new method of obtaining fine scale localized control of the magnetization,4\\piM, for defining bubble tracks in LPE garnet films is described. It involves the deposition of a thin film of silicon on the garnet surface and then annealing in oxygen, or inert gas, at moderate elevated temperatures. Under the silicon,4\\piMdecreases by large amounts upon annealing. These reductions in4\\piM, together with photolithographic techniques, can be used to define tracks for bubble propagation. Bubble propagation bit rates up to 1 MHz have been obtained in tracks\\sim6 \\mum wide. A mechanism to explain the effect is proposed involving a lowering of the relaxation time for transfer of gallium ions from octahedral to tetrahedral sites due to the presence of local oxygen defects, or Fe2+, produced in the garnet film by removal of oxygen at the heated garnet-silicon interface. In areas not covered by silicon,4\\piMremains unchanged."
"A bubble-domain memory cell and a storage loop configuration are proposed. The basic operations of writing and shifting information, which include retention and ejection of bubble domains, have been tested. Experimental results for quasi-static operation using YFeO3have shown the anticipated operating margins. This configuration has advantages of both field and conductor access, i.e., selective operation of the storage loops, bidirectional shifting, etc."
"We have studied the ordering of Fe atoms and the magnetic properties of Th(Co1-xFex)5alloys with the CaCu5- type structure. From the neutron diffraction analysis it is concluded that the larger Fe atoms prefer to occupy the site3gwhereas the smaller Co prefer to occupy the site 2c. The ordering between Fe and Co in these alloys is mainly determined by stearic considerations. The Curie temperatures are found to be sensitive to the type of heat treatment. Although the bulk anisotropy of the alloys up tox \\leq 0.7remains essentially unchanged, the coercivity decreases with increasing iron concentration. The possibility of disordered substitution of a Th atom by a pair of transition metal atoms and its role on the structural and magnetic properties is discussed."
"Generation of Bloch lines in closed domains is examined on the premise that the magnetization remains continuous at all times. The model predicts the creation of two nonunwinding lines during the formation of each domain. Precession of the wall magnetization generates trains of unwinding lines. If such a domain is split while in a comb-like configuration, the resulting walls may contain large numbers of nonunwinding lines. Conclusions are verified experimentally by determining the number and handedness of lines in domains formed under different conditions."
"A calculation is made of the effect of gallium substitution upon the magnetostriction of rare-earth garnets, a problem of some interest because of the use of gallium substituted garnets as bubble-domain materials. The gallium alters the contribution to magnetostriction of the iron lattices by simple dilution and of the rare-earth lattice by reducing the exchange field acting upon the rare-earth ions. Site preference considerations must be included in the calculation. Expressions are produced for predicting the effect upon the magnetostriction constants of gallium substitution into a typical rare-earth garnet. The special case of EuIG is treated separately. Since the contribution to magnetostriction of the Eu3+ions depends on the square of the exchange field, EuIG is more strongly affected by Ga substitution than most garnets."
"This paper describes the magnetic properties of dc sputtered thin films of Co-Gd and Co-Sm in various compositions. Magnetic moment density, hysteresis loop coercivity and squareness, and rotational hysteresis loss measurements are reported. Crystallite and domain sizes were observed with an electron microscope for a few compositions. A tentative model of magnetization reversal is proposed for some of the compositions."
"The velocity of magnetic domain walls in Bloch wall Permalloy thin films excited by interrupted easy axis drive fields is investigated and correlated with the available theory of transient wall contraction. The experimental technique is useful in determining the average wall velocity, and by comparing the velocity-field curves with field duration as a parameter it is possible to infer several features of the transient behavior. It is found that, when the displacement of the wall is of the order of a characteristic distance associated with the wall coercive force interaction, the threshold field for net motion as well as the mobility of the average velocity curves depend on the field duration. The theory together with a breakable-spring model of the coercive force interaction reasonably explain the observed phenomena."
"This paper reviews the early work on the detection of magnetic bubble domains, as well as summarizing and comparing the most recent results. Topics include InSb sensors, Permalloy sensors (thick-film as well as thin-film), and bubble stretching techniques. The limitations on sensor input power imposed by heat dissipation and other factors are discussed. The relationship between bubble size and sense signal is then examined. Finally, projections are made for the detection of submicron bubble domains."
"A method of calculating the magnitude and direction of the instantaneous flux density in a thin lamination of magnetic material is described. The technique was demonstrated by measuring the rotating flux in samples of mild steel, grain-oriented silicon iron, and at a point in the T-joint of a three-phase, three-limbed transformer core. The flux in the mild steel sample was found to rotate at a constant angular velocity and to be constant in magnitude. In the silicon iron sample, and at a point in the T-joint, the flux density varied both in angular velocity and magnitude. A large 150 Hz component of rotational flux was found to cause high localized power loss in the T-joint. The power loss was measured using the \"initial rate of rise of temperature method\" and was compared with the predicted rotational hysteresis loss."
"It is widely known that bubble domains can exist when the bias field is between the elliptic instability (runout) field Heand the bubble collapse field Hbc. Values for Heand Hbcwere calculated by Thiele. It is not widely recognized that long stripe domains can also exist in the bottom 20% of this range. Stripes are stable up to the \"stripe contraction\" field, Hsc, which is about 0.02 M/μ0above Hefor thickness over intrinsic length,h/l, values from 4 to 10. (Hbcis about 0.10 M/μ0above He.) Values for Hscwere calculated by Kooy and Enz of Philips Research Labs. in 1960, although the importance of their result to bubble-domain devices was not apparent at the time. The velocity of the domain tip during stripout and contraction such as occurs during domain detection or transfer is important for calculating maximum circuit speeds. This is given byV = cG (H-H_{sc}), whereHis the field (bias field plus local field from currents or Permalloy elements),Gis the wall mobility, andcis a constant approximately equal to 0.5."
"Magnetic and magnetostrictive properties of {100} <100> textured, polycrystalline nickel sheet have been measured in the <100> direction and compared with a randomly oriented nickel sheet. The {100} <100> textured nickel produced a 51 percent increase in the available magnetostrictive strain energy along with a 21 percent decrease in sound velocity. These improved characteristics when combined with an equivalent electromechanical coupling coefficient and a nearly linear response of magnetostrictive strain to the applied magnetic field, make \"cube\" textured nickel sheet an attractive new material for many transducer applications."
"The frequency response of a finite-length pole piece recording head is calculated numerically for various gap-to-pole-length ratios as well as for differing head-to-medium separations for an idealized sinusoidal magnetization distribution by application of the Cooley-Tukey fast Fourier transform."
"Results are reported of an investigation on the velocity of a single straight magnetic domain wall in a Ga:YIG film as a function of the drive field and of a static magnetic field applied perpendicular to the wall in the plane of the film. At all drive fields a substantial increase of the wall velocity was observed when the in-plane field was applied. At an in-plane field of about 400 Oe and at a rather low drive field (2.4 Oe above the coercive field) a maximum value in wall velocity of 270 ms-1was observed. At higher drive fields the wall velocity decreased to a constant value of 110 ms-1, independent of the drive field. This behavior can be explained by extending Slonczewski's theory of domain wall motion to the present case. From the observed wall mobility parameter we have calculated the reduced Landau-Lifshitz damping constant\\lambda/\\gamma^{2}(3.7 \\times 10^{-9}Oe2s). This value is near to the value obtained by Spencer and LeCraw from linewidth measurements in FMR on Ga:YIG spheres (5 \\times 10^{-10}Oe2s)."
"A close analogy is shown to exist between a discrete crystal model of a magnetic domain wall and the Frenkel-Kontorowa model for crystal dislocations. It is used here for a simple calculation of the intrinsic coercivity (that due solely to the discrete character of the crystal lattice) of a 180° wall in an otherwise perfect crystal. On a purely continuum level, the analogy between dislocations and domain walls as two types of mobile crystal defects has been stressed by Akulov [1]. As will be seen in the present paper, the analogy extends to the atomistic level and a simple discrete model of a domain wall leads to difference equations which are similar to those of the Frenkel-Kontorowa model [2] for a dislocation. Some of the analytical experience and physical insight gained in the treatment of the latter problem, therefore, can be transferred to the magnetic case. As an example we reexamine in the light of this analogy the concept recently introduced by van den Broek and Zijlstra [3] of intrinsic coercivity due to the discrete nature of the crystal lattice. To understand the nature of this concept consider the following idealized situation: an infinite crystal contains a single planar 180° magnetic domain wall and no other defects. From a continuum quasi-static viewpoint this wall would be perfectly mobile, moving freely (even in the absence of thermal or zero-point motion) under an arbitrarily small applied magnetic field. However, if one adopts a discrete, atomistic viewpoint, then two equivalent equilibrium domain wall configurations which differ only by the displacement through one lattice parameter will be separated by a small energy barrier and a nonzero applied magnetic field Hcwill be required to move it. This situation is completely analogous in crystal dislocation theory to the concept of the Peierls stress, which is defined as the stress required to move a straight dislocation, quasi-statically, from one equilibrium position to an adjacent equilibrium position in the absence of other defects and without the aid of thermal or zero-point motion. Its calculation also requires a model which includes the discrete character of the crystal; a purely continuum calculation leads to a zero Peierls stress. In fact, because of the close analogy, it might be desirable to use the term Peierls field for the critical applied field strength Hcsince this term so clearly conveys the concept, at least to those familiar with dislocation theory. The general nature of the model of a 180° domain wall is similar to that employed by van den Broek and Zijlstra [3]."

"A digital recording system is modeled by means of a complex Fourier series representation employing transforms of arctangent functions to describe the effects of write field gradient demagnetization and self-demagnetization. Pulse asymmetry and rise time effects are incorporated by means of phase shifts from complex transfer functions used in describing the dependence of head properties on a complex permeability. Experimental measurements on a specific system (Co substituted γ-Fe2O3tape and metal heads) show good correlation with the theory, especially with respect to spectral content, waveform shape, and peak shifts. The model is one-dimensional and limited to recording media initially ac demagnetized and to a write current range in which it is possible to define an effective penetration depth for saturation recording."
"The signal-to-noise ratio in an optical memory has been analyzed and examined experimentally. A solid-state detector can be used with MnBi as the storage media, but for media with smaller magnetooptic rotation, a photomultiplier is considered necessary. Analyzer orientation and light beam intensity have been included in the analysis. Results with experimental apparatus employing a crystal beam splitter at 45° angle and solid-state detectors compares well with analysis."
"It is shown that a previously unknown class of magnetization patterns exists in planar structures which have the unique property that all the flux escapes from one surface with none leaving the other side. A simple case is a constant amplitude rotating vector magnetization where the sense of rotation dictates which surface has no flux. More complicated magnetization patterns are elucidated. The likelihood that the one-sided flux phenomenon occurs partially in the normal write, the contact-printing and the print-through processes of tape recording is discussed. It is concluded that significant improvements in tape recording performance would ensue if means could be found to enhance the effect."
"The power loss and flux distribution in two commercial T-joints have been compared. The simple 45°-90° T-joint and the slightly more complex 45° offset T-joint were chosen for the investigation, as they are the most common joints currently used in power transformers. The localized and overall power loss of each joint was measured using now-established techniques. Each joint was built in turn into a three-limb, three-phase core, employing 15-cm wide, 0.03-cm-thick 3.2% grain-oriented silicon iron laminations. The cores were magnetized at the same overall flux densities. The localized flux distribution in individual laminations in the joints were related to the localized loss variation. Rotational flux was found to occur in both joints and it caused areas of high localized loss. A combination of normal flux between adjacent layers of laminations, rotating flux, and circulating 3rd-harmonic fluxes caused the localized loss to rise to double the average core loss in some regions of the T-joints. For the 15-cm-wide laminations used, the 45° offset joint was 10% more efficient than the 45°-90° T-joint at a flux density of 1.6 T; the mean loss of both joints was more than 25% higher than the loss in the yokes and limbs."
"Although the mathematical model of a tape traveling over a cylinder (foil bearing) has been shown experimentally to be valid for a closely similar physical model, its application to predict separation between a tape and a magnetic head has shown large discrepancies. In this work, a modified model of a foil bearing, taking into account some details of the particular geometry of magnetic heads, is used to predict separation and to compare it to experimental results. As a result, the gap between theory and experiment is narrowed down considerably."
"Various techniques for the measurement of air-bearing separation are described. Examples are given in the specific area of self-acting air-bearing sliders on rotating disks. The techniques can be categorized as capacitive, inductive and optical. The optical technique lacks frequency response but can provide an accurate and convenient way of calibration for the typically nonlinear but versatile capacitive and inductive gap sensors."
"The results of laser recording experiments in which a magnetic field controls the magnetization distribution along Curie-point switched micron-wide tracks are described. These experiments showed that analog as well as digital information may be recorded in this manner."

"The magnetic properties of individual SmCo5particles have been extensively studied in the literature. In the present work, initial magnetization curves and hysteresis loops of sintered SmCo5magnets have been drawn with a hysteresigraph. The observed properties depend on the previous magnetic treatment of the sample. After thermal demagnetization, the initial susceptibility is very high; after dc field demagnetization, it is very weak. The inner hysteresis loops are often unsymmetrical. Results are interpreted by considering the magnets as particle assemblies related together by dipolar interactions."
"The radial mode resonance frequency and quality factor behavior in general bubble lattices is studied. Results of direct calculations for the triangular lattice withl/z = 0.25are given and discussed in connection with the findings of Kaczér and Tomás. An alternative scheme allowing a calculation of the reduced frequency and quality factor on the basis of the static bubble radius field-dependence is also shown. Finally, an estimate is made of the expected frequencies and quality factors in a representative material."

"A magnetic bubble generator consisting of a Permalloy disk and a current conductor loop has been used recently in a mass memory design utilizing magnetic bubble technology. The bias field range in which the disk can hold the seed bubble is measured in this report as a function of of the rotating field frequency. Above a critical frequency fc, the bias field margins begin to decrease. The dependence of fcon disk size is obtained for disks with diameters from 16 μm up to 43 μm at rotating fields of 20 and 30 Oe. The separation between Permalloy disks and the garnet film is kept at 0.8 μm or 1.6 μm. Results show that at a fixed rotating field, a smaller disk is preferable at higher frequency for a magnetic bubble material with a given mobility. The critical frequency fcobtained is in good agreement with a theoretical calculation using the viscous damping model by Rossol et al. For frequencies below fc, the bias field margin on the disk is equal to that of the propagating channel and circuit failure due to the loss of the generator seed bubble can be eliminated."
"Various measurements are performed to investigate the spectra of clustered Barkhausen transitions in technical steel. These spectra are formed by the discontinuous jumps of magnetization in the material, when the external magnetic field is changed with relatively high speed. The methods used include power, amplitude and autocorrelation spectra and their magnetization and temperature dependences. A differential correlation is shown to exist between the optically measured grain size and the different spectra, thus confirming the basic principle of a recently proposed electronic differential grain-size analyzer for technical steel."

"The exothermic chain reactions between deuterium and fluorine were used to produce strong laser emission from carbon dioxide in a high-pressure pulsed transfer laser. The chemical chain reaction was initiated by flash photolysis of the reactive components. The active constituents were diluted in helium and premixed at temperatures of approximately -65°C to improve stability of the mixture. Peak-power outputs of 200 kW in pulses having duration of 30 μs have been observed in dilute mixtures at total pressures of one atmosphere. Energy outputs of up to 5 J, small signal-gain coefficients of 3 m-1and a chemical efficiency of 3 percent based on total gas volume have been obtained in this system. The output power, laser pulse duration, and delay are strongly dependent on partial pressures of the diluents and degree of refrigeration of the mixture. A kinetic model of the system has provided values for the gain coefficient, pulse duration, time of maximum gain, and power output in good agreement with the experiment."
"We investigate the effect of subjecting the active medium (rhodamine 6G in methanol) in a dye laser to an applied electric field. When the optical configuration is for broad-band output, an overall broadening of the output proportional to the square of the field is observed. No shift is obtained. The magnitude of this effect (7.4 \\times 10^{-8}cm-1(V/cm)-2) is much too large to be explained by the normal Stark broadening of spectral output due to a dipolar change on excitation. When a grating and beam expander are inserted into the cavity to create narrow spectral output it is found that the relative intensities of transverse modes can be controlled by variations in the applied field."
 "The vibrational relaxation of HF was measured by the laser-excited fluorescence technique over the temperature range of 295-730 K. The results are in agreement with the 350 K measurement of Airey and Fried and are consistent with the high-temperature shock-tube results of Bott and Cohen and those of Solomon et al. These results are compared with a theoretical calculation of Shin. The effect of N2, SF6, and F2on the rate of vibrational relaxation of HF was measured and found to be much slower than the relaxation rate of HF by HF molecules."
"An electrically initiated pulsed HF chemical laser has been used to measure vibrational relaxation of HF (\\upsilon = 1), CO (\\upsilon = 1), and NO (\\upsilon = 1) at 295 ± 2 K. The self-relaxation rate of HF highly dilute in argon is(8.7 \\pm 0.1) \\times 10^{4} s^{-1}torr-1and is independent of rotational level excitation over laser transitionsP_{1 \\rightarrow 0}(2) - P_{1 \\rightarrow 0}(9). The rates at which O2, CO, and NO quench HF(\\upsilon = 1) have been found to be350 \\pm 25, (2.5 \\pm 0.2) \\times 10^{3}and(6.2 \\pm 0.3) \\times 10^{3}s-1torr-1, respectively. There is indirect evidence of transfer from HF(\\upsilon = 1) to the (\\upsilon = 2) levels of NO and O2. Through the use of HF (\\upsilon = 1) as a collisional pumping source we have measured the deactivation rates of CO (\\upsilon = 1) by HF (V → R, T) and N2(V → V) to be 480 ± 25 s-1torr-1and 130 ± 15 s-1torr-1. Similarly, HF (\\upsilon = 1) has been used to pump NO (\\upsilon = 1) and the NO self-relaxation rate has been measured to be(2.7 \\pm 0.2) \\times 10^{3}s-1torr-1; this rate is about a factor of 5 faster than would be predicted by the kinetic spectroscopy results of Billingsley and Callear [43]."
"Processes of collisional redistribution of vibrational energy prevail over specific chemical reaction mechanisms in the determination of vibrational energy distributions in present hydrogen halide CW chemical lasers. Despite the resultant relatively modest departures from the Maxwell-Boltzmann form for the distribution of energy among the vibrational levels of product molecules, selective vibrational energy transfer to a second molecule (e.g., CO2) can be an effective method for the production of complete population inversion by the energy release of chemical reactions. This concept has been the basis for the development of the transfer chemical laser (TCL) during the past three years. A summary of recent progress in the development of CW and pulsed DF-CO2transfer chemical lasers is presented. An experiment designed to produce multikilowatt supersonic DF-CO2chemical laser operation with full atmospheric recovery in the exhaust gases is discussed. Recent measurements of key vibrational energy transfer processes are reviewed; such measurements have greatly clarified the kinetic aspects of the HF, DF, HF-CO2, DF-CO2, HCl-CO2and HBr-CO2chemical lasers. The very large values for these key rates (corresponding to about 20 to 200 collisions) can be attributed to energy transfer to rotation under the influence of a sizable attractive intermolecular potential well and enhanced repulsion at close range."

"Vibrational relaxation measurements in HF have been obtained at intermediate temperatures by combining the laser induced fluorescence technique with shock compression heating in a shock tube. Usually, shock tube measurements of vibrational relaxation are limited to high temperatures; above about 1300 K in the case of HF. Laser induced fluorescence measurements can be made in heated cells suitable for HF handling up to about 700-800 K. The combination of the two techniques offers several advantages includiug large range of temperatures, no wall reactions nor leaky cells at high temperature. We have used this method to obtain HF vibrational relaxation data at temperatures from 450 to 1030 K as well as at 300 K. These data together with shock tube data at high temperature (1350-4000) K are compared with theoretical predictions. Room temperature measurements with the laser induced fluorescence technique have yielded the relaxation rates of the first four vibrational levels of HF as well as an estimate of the vibration-vibration rate of energy exchange of HF with itself."
"The Statz and de Mars rate equations applied to gaseous lasers reproduce experimentally observed threshold times, initial pulse spiking, and transient oscillatory behavior. Hence they provide a theoretical basis for the equal-gain temperature method, which is based upon comparison of times to threshold. This method is generalized by use of a grating in the optical cavity to permit selection of any desired pair of transitions for gain comparison. These developments have led us to a new method for fixing vibrational rate constant ratios, the \"zero-gain temperature\" method. A tandem laser is coupled with a grating so that the \"driver\" reaction emits just above threshold for any desired transition. Then the change of time to threshold caused by the \"slave\" reaction indicates whether its gain is positive or negative. The temperature is measured at which zero gain occurs and the vibrational population can then be deduced. The relative advantages of these various methods for learning vibrational distributions in chemical reactions are considered."
 "The results of measurements of the spatial and temporal dependence of the gain of a pulsed SF6-H2hydrogen fluoride laser are reported and are compared with those for CO2lasers. While the propagation in space of a locally excited gain medium was observed to be comparable for two lasers, the time developments were vastly different. The spatial dependence of the gain for each of these lasers was measured by probing a pin laser amplifier with a small oscillator beam, while varying the distance of the probe beam from the plane of the amplifier discharge. The spatial FWHM of the gain for both HF and CO2was typically observed to be 6 mm, considerably larger than the visible glow region. Using delay techniques, the oscillator-amplifier configuration was also employed to study the gain of these lasers as a function of time. While the CO2gain typically decays after tens of microseconds, the HF gain typically does so after 1 to 2 μs. In addition, by varying the formation rate of HF, it was shown that HF itself is most likely the principal agent of this very rapid gain relaxation. This is a severe basic limitation to the efficient power output of all CW and long-pulse HF lasers. Short pulse HF devices, however, can be operated at relatively high energy. We have demonstrated this by obtaining 350-mJ pulses from a 75-cm pin laser using a 50-ns excitation pulse from a Marx bank."
"A bibliography of commonly available literature concerning chemical laser devices is presented. The types of laser devices covered are restricted to the three major ones: 1) HF or DF lasers, 2) CO2chemical transfer lasers, and 3) CO lasers. These devices are also restricted to only those which have been shown to be vibrationally excited through chemical reactions. The bibliography contains 117 references and is intended to be complete as of June 1972. The references are also listed in tables along with pertinent information about the device obtained from that reference."
"Absorption of monochromatic radiation by a low pressure gas will inieet molecules into a state|U\\rangle, with one component of velocity specified. Collisions then transfer molecules from this state to other states of interest|s_{i}\\rangle. The scattering kernelP_{1}(U \\rightarrow s_{i}, \\upsilon_{z} \\rightarrow \\upsilon_{z}')is proportional to the velocity distribution function (VDF) of molecules that have undergone one collisiom Iterates of this kernel give the VDF for those having undergone two or more collisions. We will present numerical results for P1and P2for hard spheres and the general integral for other interaction potentials. We show that P2and higher iterates of P1are closely approximated by equilibrium VDF's. Using tuned laser absorption spectroscopy the VDF of each state|s_{i}\\rangleis measured. This fmmtion is least squares approximated by the weighted sum of the appropriate Gaussian function and the function P1. The nonequilibrium contribution is proportional to the cross section for scattering from|U\\rangleto|s_{i}\\rangle. If all the important states|s_{i}\\ranglecan be observed and the total deactivation rate of|U\\rangleis known, these relative cross sections can be converted to absolute terms. We have analyzed the results of a pulsed double resonance experiment in CO2at 600 K in terms of these concepts and have found that the rate of rotationally inelastic scattering from|001, J = 11\\rangleto|001, J = J'\\ranglecan be fit by the phenomenological equationk(J = 11 \\rightarrow J = J')=\\frac{A}{1+(\\frac{11-J'}{W})^2} , 3 \\leq J' \\leq 21whereA = (1.0 \\pm 0.3) \\times 10_{6}s-1.torr-1andW = 8 \\pm 2. We will discuss other systems to which this technique should be applicable and its limitations."
"A computer simulation of a pulsed HF laser pumped by the H2+ F2chain reaction is used to study the interaction of cavity and chemical mechanisms throughout a typical pulse. The reacting mixture contained within an optical cavity is assumed homogeneous and is approximated by a chemical kinetic model. A Boltzmann distribution for the rotational levels is assumed with lasing on each vibrational band at line center of the transition having maximum gain. During lasing, the gain is held constant and equal to the threshold gain. For simplicity, initiation is simulated by a finite initial concentration of F atoms in the gas mixture. Energy generated by the pumping reactions may be stored in the vibrational levels to meet the required gain, consumed in lasing, or lost through collisional deactivation. Relative strengths of these mechanisms are determined and the effect of varying the critical rate constants is illustrated. Laser performance is found to be insensitive to HF-HF VV transfer. As expected, variations in pumping distribution among the levels of the HF(υ) have a large effect on the pulse; the relative importance of VT deactivation of HF(υ) and VV deactivations of HF(υ) by H2vary with the relative concentrations. Lasing has a large effect on the concentration of excited HF; hence, deactivation mechanisms that are important for the zero-power case are less important during lasing."
"Short-pulsed chemical lasers are analyzed with regard to establishing diagnostic relations and determining limits on laser performance. Time-dependent population inversions incorporating the effects of collisional deactivation, stimulated emission, and chemical source variation are determined using a rigorous matrix procedure. These inversions are combined with a radiative rate equation, and the resulting output intensity profiles and total energy density are evaluated for three types of source variations: 1) constant source strength, 2) exponentially varying source strength, and 3) chain reaction source. The effect of chemical branching on laser performance is investigated by using a positive exponential. A negative exponential is used to determine the effect of a declining free radical population (incomplete chain reaction) on laser performance. Both collisional deactivation and free radical decline are shown to have deleterious effects on laser output and chemical efficiency, as compared to earlier more optimistic estimates. A chain reaction source with three body volumetric termination processes is used to describe an HF laser. At low pressures the laser output is a linear combination of the constant source and exponentially declining source solutions. At high pressure either an enhanced \"reactive recombination\" mechanism or formation of HF dimers causes a nonmonotonic laser output pressure dependence similar to experimental observations."
"A numerical code has been developed to model the CO laser both in pulsed and CW Operation. The code characterizes the laser through a set of coupled quadratically nonlinear rate equations in the concentration of molecular vibrational states. All vibration-translation and vibration-vibration energy transfer processes are included in the single quantum transition approximation. Multiquantum electron molecule vibrational excitation is included together with spontaneous and stimulated emission processes. The rate coefficients used in the code will be discussed in relationship to existing experimental data and theoretical predictions. The behavior of a pulsed CO discharge laser system incorporating 30 levels of CO will be presented in relationship to available experimental data on small-signal gain. In addition, the effect of CO laser performance of a second diatomic species at both 300 K and 77 K will be discussed. The diatomic species investigated include N2, having a larger vibrational spacing than CO; NO, having a smaller spacing than CO; and a hypothetical species having a\\upsilon = 1to\\upsilon = 0spacing exactly resonant with the\\upsilon = 5to\\upsilon = 4spacing in CO."
"Small-signal gain and laser output power have been measured as a function of time for a pin-resistor transversely excited atmospheric (TEA) CO2laser gain device. Both fixed-mirror andQ-switched rotating-mirror laser cavities were studied. A set of coupled differential equations describing the mechanisms underlying gain and lasing behavior are presented. Electrical excitation of the CO2and N2vibrational modes, collisional relaxation of vibrational energy, and interaction with TEM00and plane-wave laser radiation are explicitly treated. Electrical excitation is calculated using the measured time-resolved voltage and current input to the TEA CO2gain tube in conjunction with a simple model of the discharge geometry. A single adjustable parameter relating to the physical extent of the electrical discharge enters the calculations. Direct comparisons are made between the measured quantities and the numerical predictions of the model. The value of the adjustable parameter that gives close waveform fits is consistent with the results of other experiments. Use of the rotating-mirrorQ-switched cavity resulted in laser pulses with enhanced peak power for one set of the device parameters studied. An explanation of the phenomenon is presented and a limitation on the applicability of the technique in terms of gas mixtures is discussed."
"The threshold for intracavity breakdown in large CO and CO2lasers has been calculated from solutions for the electron-energy distribution function as a function of incident laser flux. For fluxes of high intensity and short duration, a threshold fluence offt_{p} = 1J/cm2for He/N2/CO2mixtures andft_{p} \\approx 4J/cm2for He/CO is predicted. For breakdown at lower fluxes with pulsest_{p} \\gg 10^{-9}s, the threshold becomes flux dependent with values of fcwbetween4 \\times 10^{8} - 10^{9}W/cm2for typical He/N2/CO2mixtures andf_{cw} \\sim 5 \\times 10^{9}W/cm2for He/CO mixtures. Breakdown by pulses traversing laser-amplifier stages is also investigated using both the rate equation and coherent propagation formulation of the problem. It is found that in most cases of interest, breakdown occurs in the short-pulse regime and the coherent solution for the temporal structure is required."
"The performance of electron-beam-controlled atmospheric-pressure CO2laser amplifiers is reported. The amplifiers have an active length of 100 cm and a circular optical aperture of 10 cm2. The electrical parameters are 130-kV electron beam energy and 0.15-A/cm2cathode current density over 800 cm2; 20-kV gas pumping voltage and 7-A/cm2gas current density over 800 cm2. Referred to the gas, the corresponding values areE/N = 17townsends andj\\cdot E = 24kW/cm3. Small signal gain measurements on theP(20)line of the 10.4-μ band show gain coefficients up to 0.046 cm-1, depending on the electrical parameters and the gas composition. The operation of the amplifiers as lasers, the results of experiments on pulsed energy extraction, and the uniformity of the small signal gain across the optical aperture are reported."
"A quantum mechanical theory of near resonant transfer of vibrational energy is formulated and used to calculate energy transfer processes in chemical and molecular lasers. This theory is based on the existence of an exact solution to the pair of coupled differential equations describing the resonant transfer of excitation. The solution to this problem is used as the basis for a distorted wave solution to the nonresonant transfer problem.3 This approach has a number of advantages over the Born approximation in that it does not constrain the particles to travel along linear trajectories. These trajectories are distorted by the off-diagonal as well as the diagonal elements of the potential energy matrix. This effect can be very important in molecular collisions, involving the transfer of rotational and vibrational energy. As an illustration of this effect, this two-channel theory of transfer is applied to a number of energy transfer processes of interest in CO2, CO, HF, and DF chemical and molecular lasers. This theory is then generalized to theNchannel scattering problem and applied to the problem of vibrational-rotational energy conversion in hydrogen halide (HF, DF, HCl, DCl) lasers."
"Using a vibrational pumping technique based on transient stimulated Raman scattering we have measuredp\\tauvalues for VT relaxation of the\\upsilon = 1levels in N2and CO at room temperature and in the presence of several deactivants; the N2data represent the only room temperature data presently available. A mode-locked ruby laser, delivering picosecond pulses, vibrationally pumps the molecule by TSRS; the subsequent decay of the vibrational population is followed by light scattering off localized refractive index changes caused by heating arising from the thermalization of the excited state population. For rapidly relaxing molecules, heat conduction is negligible and the scattered light signal behaves as(1 - e^{-t}/\\tau_{VT})^{2}Since CO and N2relax quite slowly, heat losses can be appreciable; the resulting behavior of the scattered light signal and its relationship to a τVTwill be discussed. Thus farp\\tauvalues of 6 ± 3 and 0.7 ± 0.35 s-atm have obtained for N2and CO, respectively. In addition, data for CO deactivation by CO chemical laser contaminants, such as COS, SO2, and CS2, and preliminary temperature dependence measurements will be discussed."
 "With the aim of optimizing the performance of electrical discharge pulsed high-pressure hydrogen halide lasers, we have investigated the effects of over forty chemicals on these systems. We have examined those compounds for which the chain carrying step, X + HR\\underrightarrow{(1)}RX + H (X = Br, Cl, or F) promised to be more exothermic than the corresponding step with the usual fuels (i.e., R = H or a simple hydrocarbon radical). In the case of the less reactive halogens, production of hydrogen atoms in a nonchain reaction, directly initiated by the discharge, may well compete or dominate reaction (1) on the time scale of the lasing pulse. Because of this and the low electron temperature associated with high pressure discharges in electronegative gases, we have examined chemicals that contain a weakly bound hydrogen or a weakly bound, but highly reactive radical that could react in a second step to yield hydrogen atoms. These could then react in the lasing step, H + XR' → HX + R', to give vibrationally excited HX. Chemicals used included H2S, H2O2, highly chlorinated alkanes, alkines, and aldehydes, hydrazine, silane, and several substituted derivatives thereof. Helium and argon which improve discharge characteristics were also studied. The reaction was initiated by a 30-kV electric discharge from an array of needle electrodes, each resistively ballasted. The halogen sources used were the usual Br2, Cl2, and SF6. Results such as the enhancement of HBr lasing in a H2+ Br2mixture upon the addition of O2but not upon the addition of N2can only be explained in terms of the ensuing chemical reactions and will be discussed."
  "Lasing was initiated by a fractional microsecond pulse discharge (≈ 15 kV) in flowing CS2+ O2+ He mixtures, maintained at about 3 torr. The cavity was grating controlled, such that resonance was maintained for selected rotational lines of specified vibrational transitions. The measured τd(intervals between termination of the discharge and initiation of lasing) followed a characteristic sequence; the minimum delay (\\approx 10 \\mus) occurred for the 12 → 11 transition, with longer times for higher and lower upper vibrational states. At a CS2partial pressure of 0.05 torr, τdwere 50μs or less for transitions 14 → 13 to 5 → 4. These intervals are too short for signifigant vibrational redistribution to occur via\\upsilon-\\upsilon'processes. Hence the recorded delay sequence was explained on the basis of the initially generated distribution of vibrationally excited CO. Our data indicated:\\varphi_{14}/.../\\varphi = 0.94/1.00/0.92/0.81/ 0.70/0.60/0.50/0.41/0.33/0.25. The reliability of these ratios depends on the particular transition; we estimate a factor of 2 for\\upsilon = 7, 6, 5due to the initial uncertainty of the\\varphi_{11}/\\varphi_{12}ratio. The relative populations were also estimated from relative chemiluminescence intensities recorded under conditions identical to laser operation but in the absence of mirrors. While this distribution is in agreement with that reported from other laboratories for\\upsilon > 8, there is a significant difference for the\\upsilon \\leq 7range, in that substantial fractions are generated in the low υ states."
"Vacuum ultraviolet photolysis of CF3I provides a convenient fluorine atom source for chemical laser studies, as noted by Berry. Following Berry, we have used this source for a study of laser emission from the reaction. F + HI → HF + I,\\DeltaH = -64kcal. Laser emission is observed from all vibrational transitions up to\\upsilon = 6 \\rightarrow 5, indicating that as much as 94 percent of the reaction energy can go into HF vibrational excitation. The\\upsilon = 4 \\rightarrow 3transition displays highest gain;\\upsilon = 4requires about 63 percent of the available energy. The equal gain temperature technique has been used to measure the rate constant ratio,k_{4}/k_{3}. The result obtained,k_{4}/k_{3} = 1.19 \\pm 0.03, is in good agreement with recent measurements based upon infrared chemiluminescence. Experiments directed at measuring the temperature dependence of such rate constant ratios were described. Equal gain measurement of the same ratio at different temperatures are possible since the highest gain transitions change with temperature. The reaction studied was F + D2→ DF + D,\\DeltaH = -32kcal. CF2I was the fluorine source. The value ofk_{3}/k_{2}, was found to be 1.5± 0.1 at 301 K. Preliminary data suggested a monotonic rise in the ratio as the temperature was increased, iu qualitative agreement with the molecular beam results reported by Lee et al."
"The use of a chemical laser as a probe make easy the direct absorption or amplification of light by a reactive medium, at a given precise time. If we make such a measurement with each vibration-rotation transition yielded by the laser probe one gets a direct view on the evolution of population of the synthetized molecules during a chemical reaction. As a result we have a direct knowledge of the relative formation rates of the molecules on various vibrational levels and of the temperature evolution in the reactive gas. When the reaction has stopped, the decay of the population on each vibrational level gives a measurement of the corresponding vibrational relaxation time. Results will be presented concerning the reaction of atomic hydrogen with chloride, nitrosyl chloride."
"Advanced techniques for HF/DF laser diagnostics have been developed, tested, and applied to the measurement of HF laser cavity characteristics. In this paper we shall discuss the experimental techniques, potentials, and limitations on the basis of diagnostic data which will be presented. The detailed discussion of the measurement results will be discussed in a separate paper. Diagnostic techniques to be discussed will include chemiluminescent infrared analysis of the HF fundamental band which permits a determination of flow field rotational and kinetic temperatures with very high accuracy. Excited HF vibration-rotation state number densities down to\\sim10^{11}excited molecule/cm3can be determined from absolutely measured line intensities using 30-s spectrometer scan times. Measurements problems related to considerable cavity medium gain or absorption will be discussed in detail. Application and advantages of diagnostic chemiluminescence using harmonic HF transitions\\Delta\\upsilon = 3, 4,and 5 in the near IR and visible spectrum, detectable with photoemissive detectors, have also been considered and applied. Flow field visualization has been achieved by high speed infrared mapping and \"orange glow\" photography. The data presentation, interpretation, and comparison of the different flow field visualization techniques will be considered. In order to determine the important HF ground state concentrations in laser cavities we have utilized an infrared HF resonance absorption method with most encouraging results. The latter method has also been applied to the direct measurement of small-signal gain for both the 1-0 and 2-1 HF transitions. We shall further discuss the applications of laser scattering and electron beam excited fluorescence to the measuremeat of important laser cavity characteristics."
"Recent experimental studies have shown that small quantities of nitrogen oxides can seriously effect discharge stability and power output in flowing CO2discharge lasers. In the present study, the formation of these oxides was measured in a sealed-off discharge tube under operating conditions similar to those in CO2lasers. The gas composition was sampled with a modulated molecular beam, low-voltage ionizer, quadrupole mass spectrometer. The combined use of low ionizer voltage and phase sensitive detection eliminated extraneous mass peaks caused by background gases and dissociative ionization in the analyzer itself. Equilibrium and time-varying measurements were made of neutral and ionix species. Two initial gas compositions were used 1) 71.8 percent He, 15.5 percent N2, 12.7 percent CO2, and 2) 87.2 percent He, 12.8 percent CO2. Measurements were made in a discharge tube 2.2 cm inside diameter, 26 cm between electrodes. The system was pumped to approximately 10-6mm Hg between data runs. Total pressure was varied from 1 to 8 mm Hg and discharge current from 0 to 80 mA. Typical CO2dissociation data at 40 mA and 4 mm Hg indicate an initial rate of7(\\pm0.5) \\times 10^{-2}s-1with an equilibrium value of approximately 65 percent dissociation in the He/ N2/CO2mixture and slightly lower vatues in the He/CO2mixture. Under the same conditions, nitric oxide (NO) exhibited a buildup rate of8(\\pm1) \\times 10^{-2}s-1with an equilibrium value of approximately 0.1 percent of total gas composition. Nitrogen diozide (NO2) was detected by comparing the relative amounts of mass numbers 45 and 46. Data indicate that in the He/N2/ CO2mixture the NO2component of mass 46 can be as high as 0.12 percent of total mixture with an initial buildup rate of7(\\pm2) \\times 10^{-2}s-1at 80 mA discharge current. Measurement of the ion spectra at the cathode indicate that CO2+ is the major initial ion in the He/N2/CO2mixture, but decays with a rate of2.5 (\\pm.5) \\times 10^{-1}s-1and is replaced by NO+at approximately the same rate. In the He/CO2mixture CO2+ is replaced as the major ion by O2+ , with with slightly lower rates than those measured in the mixtures containing N2."
     "Predictions and measurements of stimulated emission for this laser are compared for H2pressures from threshold to stoichiometric, a range of several orders of magnitude. Slowly flowing helium-diluted 50-torr mixtures were initiated photolytically. Two dilution ratios and two output couplers are studied. Good agreement is found for time-to-threshold and pulse duration versus H2and for threshold H2pressure. Spiking and possibly mode beating, features not modeled, are observable in some pulses. Mostly, however, predicted intensity versus time agrees in pulse shape with laser output. Observed and predicted peak intensities nearly match for low H2pressure. The predicted increase of peak intensity with low H2is fairly well followed. For2in the vicinity of one-tenth stoichiometric the data show an abrupt leveling off of peak intensity while the calculations predict a continuing increase. This behavior seemingly cannot be attributed to uncertainties iu the kinetic model. All rate modifications considered prove to be incapable of prodating a large or abrupt enough change to explain the data. Experimental results are presented supporting the notion that parasitic oscillations cause this change in laser output. Future comparisons providing fuller tests of the theory are identified as are experiments to test parasitic oscillation suppression schemes."
"A spectroscopic technique for measuring time-varying gas kinetic temperatures with submicrosecond time resolution is described. The temperature in H2O discharges is determined from instantaneous OH emission spectra at ∼3064 Å. The temperature rose linearly from 350 K to ∼2000 K at the end of a 4-μs 150-A current pulse through H2O. This temperature rise tends to switch off the gain and shorten the lsser pulse. Helium, when added, limited the temperature rise to ∼200 K and lengthened the laser pulse. Previous observations that the laser medinm becomes lossy after the end of the current pulse is shown to be due to the observed temperature rise. Models of pulsed lasers should include temperature, and hence time-dependent rate constants, to be accurate. Time-varying gas kinetic temperatures in pulsed CO2-N2-He laser plasmas, e.g., in TEA CO2lasers, could be determined by this technique using the 3371-Å emission from the second positive system of nitrogen."
      "The chemical and energy transfer reactions involved in the helium-diluted DF-CO2chemical transfer laser system are discussed. Experimental and theoretical rate coefficient literature is reviewed and the most probable rates are selected for the kinetic model of the reaction system. Results of computer experiments show the relative importance of these reactions for pulsed laser simulation. Predicted laser performance is most sensitive to values of rate coefficients for DF-CO2transfer, collisional deactivation of CO2(00°1) by DF, and collisional deactivation of DF(υ) by D and F. A detailed investigation of the relationship of cavity and chemical mechanisms for two levels of initiation is presented for an initial composition of XF:1F2:1D2:8CO2:40He at 50 torr and 300 K with X = 0.1 and 0.01. For F = 0.01, a 260-μs pulse with six percent chemical efficiency is predicted, while the higher level initiation level (F = 0.1) produces a 52-μs pulse with eight percent efficiency."
"Grating couplers provide an attractive method for the excitation of optical thin-film waveguides. We present here a perturbation analysis of etched or deposited grating couplers based upon both the transmission line and the Green's Function approaches, which predict the coupling efficiency, the output radiation beamwidth, the angular dependence of excitation, and the intensities of the other orders of the diffracted beams as functions of the grating periodicity, grating groove depth, and excitation direction. It is found that the maximum excitation efficiency is 81 percent, that high efficiency can be achieved by excitation from the substrate, and that higher efficiency is obtained when the radiation leakage to the side orders is minimized."
"A dispersive quartz prism is used to couple the total second harmonic generated in both directions by an internal cavity frequency doubler. The study shows that the dispersion of air and mirror reflection phase shifts can be compensated for by a slight nonphase match condition in the doubler."
"The population of the excited vibrational states\\upsilon = 1through\\upsilon = 6of hydrogen fluoride has been determined by spectroscopic measurements on a chain reacting mixture of hydrogen and fluorine dilute in helium. The reaction is initiated by partially dissociating the hydrogen molecules with an electric discharge prior to mixing with the fluorine. Mixing is accomplished with a specially designed laminar flow nozzle to provide an easily modeled reaction region. Typical experimental conditions are a mixture of 1:1:20 (H2:F2:He) at a total pressure of 5 torr and a flow velocity of 100 m/s. Information on deactivation rates is obtained by making population measurements at various distances along the flow, which is equivalent to following the time development of the populations. Because there are a number of time dependent phenomena occurring simultaneously (e.g., reaction, diffusion,\\upsilon-\\upsilonand\\upsilon-tprocesses) it is not possible to determine deactivation rates directly from the experimental data. Instead, the experimental data are compared with the predictions of a computer model of the reaction which treats all the significant processes and includes the best currently available reaction and deativation rates. The calculated populations for vibrational levels\\upsilon = 4-6are consistently larger than the experimentally measured populations, particularly for\\upsilon = 6where the error approaches a factor of 10. The low populations imply a deactivation rate for the higher vibrational levels of HF which is significantly larger than the currently accepted values. A straightforward analysis based upon the known pumping rates and the known concentrations of deactivating species strongly suggests that deactivation by hydrogen atoms is responsible. The data do not provide sufficient information to choose between the two hydrogen atom reactions 1) H + HF* → HF + H 2) H + HF* → H2+ F as the cause of the deactivation. Computer calculations using reactions 1 and 2 separately produce better agreement, however, for the reverse \"cold\" reaction 2. The rate constant required to explain the low population of\\upsilon = 6is approximately2 \\times 10^{-10}cm3/molecule.s or an effective collision cross section 0.4 times the gas kinetic cross section."
"A computer model coupling one-dimensional descriptions of reaction kinetics, V-V and V-T energy transfer, stimulated emission and nonequilibrimn gas dynamics, which has been developed to characterize chemically pumped CO laser media, is described. Theoretical predictions of such parameters as small-signal gain coefficient and specific laser power are presented for the CW CO lasing system chemically pumped by the bimolecular exchange reactions O + CS2→ CS + SO O + CS → CO* + S. The species compositions and state populations of the laser emitters are characterized by a set of rate equations that include anharmonic effects where appropriate. Classical one-dimensional conservation equations are used to evaluate the thermodynamic state functions of the flow. The model assumes a transverse Fabry-Perot cavity to evaluate laser emission on multiple cascading, vibrational-rotational transitions. Gain coefficient computations include the effects of self- and foreign-gas broadening. Results of a parametric study which explicitly identifies the influence of key variables on CO laser characteristics-specific output power and small signal gain coefficients-are presented."
"Chemical laser performance for unstable cylindrical confocal oscillators with active gain media is presented. The performance predictions are based on an analytical model that includes a flowing laser medium with pumping and deactivating reactions approximating real chemical lasers. The active oscillator is treated in terms of a Fresnel integral with the \"thin skin\" approximation for the gain region. The resulting nonlinear coupled equations, describing the behavior of both the optical fields and the species production and deactivation, are solved self-consistently. The approach utilized here is novel, and differs from the usual physical optics treatments of saturation, which begin with active medium properties derived solely from small-signal gain distributions. It is shown that the small-signal gain distribution in a high flow velocity medium does not correlate in any important way with the saturated gain distribution and under flow conditions may not be derived from it. The effects of varying output coupling and chemical kinetics parameters upon the optical field saturation levels are presented, as well as predictions concerning the presence of multimoding derived from the observation of transverse mode beating in the model."
"An experiment resulting in measurement of vibration to vibration transfer rate in pure HF is described. The technique involves pumping a sample cell containing pure HF with an HF chemical laser oscillating on a\\upsilon = 1 \\rightarrow \\upsilon = 1transition, and then using a filter cell monoehromator combination to separate the\\upsilon = 2 \\rightarrow \\upsilon = 1fluorescence from that of\\upsilon = 1 \\rightarrow \\upsilon = 0. An analytic model yielding the time resolved\\upsilon = 2 \\upsilon = 1fluorescence is also developed. This model indicates that the rise time of the observed\\upsilon = 2 \\rightarrow \\upsilon = 1fluorescence gives a direct measurement of the vibration-vibration transfer rate, out of\\upsilon = 2; that is, the process HF(\\upsilon = 2) + HF(\\upsilon = 0) \\rightarrow 2HF(\\upsilon = 1). In addition it shows that the population of\\upsilon = 2is proportional to its rate of production and hence to the population in the\\upsilon = 1state squared. As a result the apparent decay rate of our observed\\upsilon = 2fluorescence is twice that for\\upsilon = 1. We find good agreement between these predictions and the results of the time resolved fluorescence experiments. The implication of these results to previous measurements of HF V-T (or V-R) relaxation rate is discussed briefly."
     "A solution is given for the parametric interaction of two traveling waves (\\upsilon_{k, k}) and (\\omega, k) where(\\upsilon_{k, k}) \\ll (\\omega, K). The strong pump wave at frequency υkis not affected but modulates the index of refraction for the weak wave at ω. The solution is for an arbitrary initial time dependence of the weak wave and can describe a large change in the fractional bandwidth of the modulated wave. If the phase velocities υ and\\omega/Kare equal, the cycles of the high-frequency wave bunch together in every other half-cycle of the modulation wave and draw apart in the alternate half-cycles. This strong phase bunching is accompanied by strong amplitude modulation that is found to have the samexandtdependence as the instantaneous frequency."
"The efficiency of a Nd3+glass laser pumped by a xenon flash lamp was improved by circulating fluorescent dyes around the laser rod. The dyes used here absorb in the spectral region in which the neodymium ions do not absorb and fluoresce strongly at one of the pump bands of Nd3+. This results in a more efficient utilisation of the flashlamp light output. These dyes also prevent solarization due to their absorption in the ultraviolet region. A 38-percent decrease in threshold and a nearly 50-percent increase in slope efficiency were observed."
 "We report here calculations of pulsed CO laser operation by revealing the time evolution of the CO vibrational distribution function in electrically pumped CO-N2-He mixtures. This is accomplished through a time-dependent solution of the coupled rate equations for the first 50 vibrational levels of CO considering V-V and V-T processes, spontaneous and stimulated emission, electron impact excitation, and deexcitation as well as kinetic heating of the lasing medium. The electron excitation rates as a function ofE/Nare obtained from calculations of the steady-state electron distribution function in the appropriate gas mixtures. In addition to following the time dependence of pulsed operation, CW calculations have been performed for the purpose of comparison with the results of other investigators. Comparisons between the predicted time of appearance of lasing lines and experimental data is quite good for both the free-running and single-line modes of operation."
                   "Use of laser photolysis for initiation of pulsed chemical lasers is described. In laser-initiated chemical lasers, the transient photochemical state evolves from a well-defined initial state without obscurant time variation of photolysis products. Spatial confinement of the initiating radiation reduces undesired effects of reflections from the enclosure walls and permits near coincidence between the reactant volume and that of the fundamental cavity mode. Application of the laser-initiation technique to an HF laser pumped by H2+ F2chain reactions is discussed. Two distinct time regimes are found in the HF laser transient. The laser intensity in the initial regime exhibits large amphtude pulses characteristic of unsteady oscillations in high-gain media, whereas the relatively low-levels intensity in the second regime exhibits long-term variations characteristic of quasi-steady changes induced by reaction-deactivation processes. Variation of intensity features in both time regimes with physical parameters governing the photochemical state of the reactant media is described."
         "The use of artificial periodic structures, consisting of spatial modulations of the linear and nonlinear susceptibilities of a nonlinear optical medium, to achieve phase matching in second-harmonic generation is analyzed. Dispersion relations and approximate formulas for the second-harmonic fields generated under various conditions are obtained and used to evaluate the experimental situation."
"Techniques for constructing a stable mode-locked Nd:YAlG laser source suitable for long term unattended operation are described. These techniques involve the use of two types of electronic feedback loops-the oscillator loop and the servo loop. An additional auxiliary loop to provide for long term operation is described and demonstrated. The detuning properties of the mode-locked laser, using both intracavity loss and phase modulation, are obtained experimentally for the open loop. It was found that the loss-modulated mode-locked laser was noisy due to relaxation oscillations. However, the use of a phase-modulated mode-locked laser presented other problems due to the possibility of a spontaneous 180 ° switch in envelope phase of the pulses. A technique for quenching this phase switching is described. The results of applying these techniques led to the experimental demonstration of a mode-locked Nd : YAlG laser that operated for long times (48 h), with an error rate (dropping a pulse or mistiming of a pulse) of1.4 \\times 10^{-10}, with and rms variation of 8.2 percent in the second harmonic at 0.53 μm and with an absence of relaxation oscillation."
"A subsonic transverse-flow chemical laser has been instrumented to permit measurements of vibration-rotation state populations and laser output spectra under flow conditions typical of present CW hydrogen halide laser operation. Measurements are presented for the F + HI, F + HBr, F + CH4, F + HCl, F + H2, Cl + HI, and Cl + HBr atom-exchange reaction systems. CW operation was found to be characterized by relatively modest departures from Maxwell-Boltzmann vibrational energy distributions at all stages of reaction in contrast to pulsed operation based on similar reactions. The distributions of vibrational energy are controlled primarily by energy transfer and deactivation processes, rather than by specific reaction mechanisms, under these conditions."
"Oscillation at 0.930 μm was obtained by end pumping ac-axis Nd:YALO rod at 300 K with the output of a pulsed xenon ion laser."
 "On the basis of the theoretical and experimental investigations reported in our previous paper we have built and tested a fast high-power iodine amplifier system. Operating the oscillator in a \"gain-switched\" mode we succeeded, using a Pockel's cell, in producing 5-MW/5-ns pulses. These pulses are amplified in two stages. By judicious control of the optical feedback and fast pumping, the first stage is operated above threshold as an \"overshoot amplifier.\" The threshold of the last amplifier is controlled by a magnetic field. By saturating this amplifier, pulses in the gigawatt range were obtained. From these experiments we derive scaling laws for the construction of a 1-kJ/5-ns iodine pulse amplifier system. We believe this can be a serious competitor to existing neodymium glass lasers in fusion experiments."
 "Optical gain was detected in the CO X1\\Sigma+infrared transitionsP_{9-8}(12)andP_{8-7}(12)in a 4.6-cm-long free-burning C2H2-O2flame. At a total pressure of 11-torr gain (or loss) on theP_{9-8}(12), transition was measured in the preflame, visible flame, and postflame zones of fuel-lean flames."
"A detailed comparison of four types of electrode structures for HF laser action was made. The HF was produced by transverse discharges through SF6/RH mixtures. The pulse energy, pulse duration, and spectroscopic output were measured as a function of the type of hydrogen donor, its partial pressure as well as the total pressure when He was added. The hydrogen donors used were H2, CH4, C2H6, C3H8, and commercial gasoline."
"A summory is presented of recent accomplishments and the state of the art of far-infrared (far-IR) molecular lasers. Problems of excitation, laser line assignments, relaxation, and absolute frequency measurements are discussed. Predictions of future far-IR developments are made."
"A CW-CO chemical laser has been produced in a fast-flow system by mixing N, O2, and CS2. The power output and spectral characteristics are similar to the O plus CS2system indicating that the final reaction steps are the same. Experimental and analytical evidence are presented to support the initiating step N + CS2→ CS + NS followed by NS + N → N2+ S and the importance of the reaction S + O2→ SO + O in supplying atomic oxygen. The conclusions of this work are that these atomic nitrogen reactions appear to be very fast and hence do not appreciably limit laser power, and that active nitrogen can be used to produce other atomic species in sizeable concentrations."
"The spectrum of the light emitted at 10 200 Å by an NO laser is photographed with high resolution. The rotational analysis fully confirms the assignment made earlier to the transitionF^{2}\\Delta-C^{2}\\Pi(1, 1) between two electronically excited levels of the NO molecule, both of which are configurationally mixed with valence levels."
 "The details of the analysis, design, and operation of a Nd-glass-disk-laser amplifier which has been constructed at the Naval Research Laboratory are presented. Gain and fluorescence measurements have been compared to theoretical predictions; these show that 0.6-J/cm3energy storage is achieved in the disk (assuming a cross section of3.0 \\times 10^{-20}cm2). The effects of unsuppressed parasitic oscillations are demonstrated and an effective method of preventing their occurrence is shown. The disk amplifier has demonstrated 320-J output in a 1-ns pulse with 110-J input."
"Sophisticated numerical calculations have been made of the optical power densities available in electric CO2lasers. For high values of the vibrational temperature of the ν3mode (> 1000 K), they give values 25 percent lower than those obtained by the classical gain-saturation formula. This oversaturation effect may also exist in other types of lasers."
"Vacuum ultraviolet emission from high-pressure Xe gas under excitation by a pulsed electron beam has been investigated. When cavity mirrors were provided, significant line narrowing and a thousandfold increase in spectral intensity occurred at 1730 ± 10 Å. This was accompanied by severe mirror burning and provides strong evidence that an associative molecular Xe laser has been achieved."
"Deformation of the spot of an off-axis Gaussian beam after passing through a lens-like glass fiber (SELFOC®) with the fourth-order aberration is investigated by using first-order perturbation theory and numerical calculation. A method for determining the coefficient of the fourth-order aberration is proposed. By this method, it is found that a SELFOC sample (0.5 mm in diameter and 150 mm in length) has a coefficienthof about 1.1, if the dielectric constant in the meridional plane of the sample is expressed as\\epsilon(x) = \\epsilon(0) (1 - g^{2}x^{2} + hg^{4}x^{4}), wherexis the distance from the axis of the medium andgis a positive constant."

"A thermally tunedQ-switched ruby laser of moderate power, with emission wavelength at 6939 Å, has been used to selectively excite the4^{2}P_{3/2}-6^{2}S_{1/2}transition in the atoms of a pure potassium plasma of low degree of ionization produced in a hot cathode diode. A pulse of intensified spontaneous emission has been observed at 6939 Å, 6911 Å, and at a number of other wavelengths. The possibility of using this type of interaction for localized plasma diagnostics has been studied experimentally. It has been found that the intensified signal decay time decreases with increasing electron density, thereby providing a potential means for measurement of this parameter. In particular, it is shown that because of a saturation effect, the recorded signal characteristics depend to some extent on the laser parameters. A specially tailored laser performance is suggested as essential in order to overcome these problems and obtain signals which depend unambiguously on the plasma conditions."
"The properties of AlxGa1-xAs heterojunction incoherent edge emitters are described. Single (SH) and double-heterojunction (DH) diodes emitting at about 8200 Å were studied. The highest CW radiance measured perpendicular to the emitting facet was 95 W/cm2.sr at 4200 A/cm2for a stripe-geometry SH device. This high radiance level was found to be consistent with an operating life of many thousands of hours. The near- and far-field patterns of the diodes are presented as well as the spectral characteristics and the radiance as a function of drive current, both pulsed and dc."
"An optical modulator having a bandwidth of 1.6 GHz and a required power of 1 W for 100-percent intensity modulation at the wavelength of 0.63 μm has been constructed. The wide-band and low-drive power performance is obtained by the use of a structure-like beam waveguide."
"The transmission of Kodak 9740 dye solutions as a function of picosecond pulse energy has been measured. The experimental results have been compared to theoretical ones. The validity of these results is borne out by the variation of the round-trip transit gain in the train of pulses emitted by a Nd3+glass laser mode locked by a Kodak 9740 dye solution. On the basis of this last result, it appears that the dye is not yet saturated at the beginning of the train of pulses."
"A number of photoionization mechanisms and how they can be used to generate large-volume laser plasmas are discussed. Reaction rates for two-step photoionization of the cesium atoms as well as formation of molecular ions (Cs2+) are estimated. The necessary cross-section data were obtained from related research in thermionic energy converters."
"Properties of planar dielectric waveguides having a diffusion-induced index of refraction distribution are investigated. It is found that the spatial distribution of modes, group velocity, and mode spectrum of these guides differed qualitatively from the corresponding properties found in a slab waveguide. These results were experimentally verified by measuring the mode spectrum of a dielectric waveguide having an assumed complimentary error-function distribution of refractive index."
"Frequency characteristics of a nonlinear lasing gain under the condition that a laser oscillation exists at a fixed frequency are theoretically obtained on the basis of a band-to-level transition model (without thek- selection rule) of semiconductor lasers. This nonlinear gain exhibits a spectral hole-burning in the vicinity of oscillation frequency as well as a decrease from the corresponding linear gain over the entire spectral region. The analysis uses a semiclassical density-matrix formalism and a perturbation method. The lasing transitions are assumed to occur between a conduction-band Bloch state and a localized acceptor level. The above-defined nonlinear gain is obtained from a third-order perturbation calculation. In the neighborhood of a lasing frequency, a narrow spectral region where the gain is burned is theoretically found (hole-burning effect). The width of this \"hole\" increases with the relaxation rate at acceptor states, and is almost independent of excitation level. The gain decrease over the entire spectral region results from the absence of thek-selection rule, and corresponds to the saturation of spontaneous emission after the onset of lasing. Rapid relaxations in the conduction band and lower acceptor concentrations make more significant gain decreases at a frequency sufficiently apart from the lasing frequency. This effect makes possible a single axial-mode operation in some cases."
"The response of germanium photon-drag detectors at high CO2-laser intensities is found to be nonlinear. Depending on the conditions, both superlinearity and saturation can be observed. It is known that the absorption of germanium at 10.6 μm decreases at high intensities, while the resistivity increases. It is shown that the nonlinear behavior of drag detectors can be satisfactorily accounted for by taking account of these two effects. In consequence, it is shown that it is possible to design germanium photon-drag detectors, without sacrifice of sensitivity, which are linear within a few percent up to power densities of about 40 MW.cm-2."
"An analysis of the TE modes of a slab waveguide with graded refractive-index distribution is presented. The refractive index is approximated by a piecewise-linear distribution for which exact solutions of the guided-wave problem can be obtained. For multimode guides, useful approximate solutions can be worked out with the help of the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation. A formula is given for the total number of guided TE modes supported by the waveguide. The coupling efficiency of a prism coupler is investigated by studying the radiation losses of the guided modes escaping from the waveguide through the coupling prism. It is found that the radiation losses of the modes of the graded-index waveguide are more nearly constant than those of the asymmetric slab waveguide."
"Although there has been a sustained interest in unstable open resonators for high-power laser applications, no satisfactory theory has previously been developed to explain the intricate behavior of the complex eigenvalues obtained by numerical solution of the resonator integral equation. The present study proposes a remarkably simple model that predicts the basic features of the published results. In this model, a two-dimensional resonator with finite convex mirrors is regarded as an open-ended waveguide with hyperbolic boundaries. Through use of the modal fields in the waveguide region and modal reflection and coupling coefficients due to the open end, one may construct a resonance equation for the eigenvalues of the free resonant fields (eigenmodes) in the unstable resonator. From a study of the resonance equation as a function of mirror size, it may be concluded that a single waveguide mode is primarily responsible for the eigenmode behavior near a loss minimum, and that two selectively coupled waveguide modes provide the behavior in the intervals between loss minima. The selection of the appropriate waveguide modes is accomplished with the aid of a resonance chart for the simpler problem wherein mode coupling at the open waveguide end is omitted. Results are presented and compared with the earlier literature."
"Mode-locked ring oscillators and ring amplifiers have been investigated experimentally and theoretically. Numerical solutions to the rate equations showed that nonlinear losses have to be introduced into the rate equations in order to explain the experimental observations. The theory yields operating conditions for mode locking in good agreement with the experiment. Application of this theory to ring amplifiers shows that very good control of the injected pulse energy and the pump power are required for efficient suppression of satellite pulses. Preliminary experimental results support our theoretical predictions."
"The experimental and theoretical investigation of thin-film metal (bismuth, antimony, chromium, nickel) bolometers on beryllium oxide substrates is described. Responsivity, sensitivity (NEP), and time response data for each type of metal bolometer are compared with the results obtained from a thermal analysis of the bolometer. Thin-film bismuth devices can have a responsivity of2.2 \\times 10^{-2}V/W and an NEP of5.0 \\times 10^{-8}W/Hz1/2with nanosecond response time. We report measurement of 2- ns response times for bismuth-film bolometers and calculated subnanosecond response times with thinner film devices. These results show that room-temperature thin-film, metal-bolometer IR detectors should be capable of detecting nanosecond and subnanosecond rise-time IR pulses with peak power levels of the order of a few milliwatts."
"The ability of a nanosecond or shorter CO2-laser pulse consisting of a single vibrational-rotational transition to extract energy from an atmospheric-pressure CO2amplifier is limited owing to the finite rotational thermalization time in CO2and the larger number of rotational states which share the stored energy. Theoretical studies are reported which indicate that utilizing an incident pulse consisting of several vibrational-rotational lines within the 10.6-μ band substantial improvements can be obtained over single-line extraction. Even more dramatic improvements are possible if the pulse contains vibrational-rotational transitions at both the 10.6- and 9.6-μ bands. Quantitative energy-extraction results are presented for an input Gaussian pulse consisting of1-5 10.6-\\mutransitions, and for a pulse containing one line at 9.6 μ and one at 10.6 μ, traversing a 1-m amplifier, for a wide range of input energies, pulsewidths, and gas pressures. Possibilities of using multiband techniques for pulse shaping are also discussed."
"Experimental studies have been conducted into the dominant effects and possible limitations of TEA CO2laser operation at high repetition rates. These studies were carried out in a small channel which provided for a uniform gas flow at atmospheric pressure transverse to a finned-cathode double-discharge structure. Measurements taken over a range of circuit and gas conditions showed that the major limitation on the repetition rate in TEA CO2lasers is the onset of arcing in the discharge rather than thermal heating of the gas. The results indicate that the likely cause of the arcing is the production of impurity species during the discharge pulse, and that in order to obtain stable operation these impurity species must be swept from the discharge region prior to the succeeding pulse."
"A 45° Faraday rotator has been built at the Naval Research Laboratory. This rotator is designed for use with a short-pulse high-peak-power laser, and it has demonstrated an extinction ratio in excess of 35 dB."
"A comparison is made between internal polarization modulation (IPM) (or coupling modulation) and external polarization modulation (EPM). This is done for the case of maximum-available laser signal power output when both bias and drive voltages are optimized, as well as for the case of a small fixed drive voltage but optimized bias conditions. Signal-to-noise ratio and efficiency is also considered. Calculations were made without recourse to small-signal theory. Results reveal the conditions of laser gain and modulator loss under which IPM is advantageous."
"Thirty-five photons (\\lambda = 3 \\mum) per photolytic F atom have been obtained from a 40-cm3photochemical laser filled with 400 torr of F2, 100 torr of H2, and minor amounts of Ar and O2mixed at 300 K. With 0.035-percent dissociation of the F2, 0.83-J 250-ns full width at half maximum (FWHM) pulses were observed."
"Using a TEM00qnear Gaussian mode ruby laser system we report the first experimental measurements of intensity induced changes of optical polarization (ellipse rotation) in a cubic crystalline medium, YAG, for which we obtain the nonlinear susceptibilities\\chi_{3}^{1221} (- \\omega, \\omega, \\omega, -\\omega) = 6.34 \\times 10^{-15}ESU and\\frac{1}{2} (\\chi_{3}^{1111} + \\chi_{3}^{1221} - 2\\chi_{3}^{1212}) = 7.18 \\times 10^{-15}ESU, accurate to better than ±7 percent relative to\\chi_{3}^{1221} (- \\omega,\\omega,\\omega, -\\omega)for liquid CS2. These values are compared with further results obtained for fused quartz and two laser glasses. Moreover, by time resolving the ellipse rotation data we demonstrate the capability to plot ellipse rotation versus input power on a single laser shot, thus increasing the practical feasibility of the technique and introducing the possibility of resolving transient contributions to the measurement."
"Detailed, spatially resolved gain measurements have been made on a UV preionized9 \\times 9 \\times 50-cm atmospheric pressure discharge."
"Polymethine laser dyes which fluoresce in the near infrared in organic solvents generally exhibit poor temporal stability at room temperature. Two typical laser-pumped polymethine dyes in aqueous solutions containing nonionic surfactants are investigated. Temporal stability was improved 20-fold, as compared to organic solutions, with no significant changes in laser-pumping threshold or tuning range."
"A new method for reducing the pattern effect in PCM current modulation of DH-GaAlAs lasers without superposition of dc bias current is demonstrated at 200 Mb/s. Also PCM current-modulation characteristics are analyzed by simulation using nonlinear rate equations."
"The relative contributions of the Kerr, electrostrictive, and thermal effects to the self-focusing thresholds of borosilicate crown glass, fused silica, and dense flint glass have been estimated from an analysis of damage-threshold data for linearly polarized and circularly polarized radiation. The measurements were made with a Nd:glass laser operating in the TEM00mode with a temporal pulsewidth of 25 ns. The Kerr effect appears to be the largest effect. The thermal effect is also significant. The electrostrictive effect is smallest. Reasonable values of the absorption coefficient are calculated from the thermal contribution. The results are in qualitative agreement with the work of others."
"An unstable ring resonator has been studied, both theoretically and experimentally; quasi-traveling-wave operation is obtained with a high ratio of the powers of the two opposite rotating waves and with diffraction-limited output beams."
"A simple and sensitive interferometric technique which yields accurate measurements of the 2nd- , 4th-, and 6th-order coefficients of the series expansion for the radial distribution of the dielectric constant of SELFOC or other GRIN rods is reported. Such data are required, for example, in predicting temporal dispersion in SELFOC fiber waveguides. The interferometer directly measures the relative phase delay along meridional-ray paths of different initial field angles. The mathematical analysis consists of finding the 2nd-, 4th-, and 6th-order coefficients which yield the best least squares fit to the measured phase shifts. The 4th-order results are found to be in good agreement with those of I. Kitano and co-workers. As an experimental application we describe a small, mechanically stable, diffraction-limited collimator for use with an optical fiber waveguide."

"Laser action has been observed for the following rare-earth ions in YAlO3:Ho3+(sensitized with Er3+and Tm3+), Er3+, and Tm3+(sensitized with Er3+) at wavelengths of 2.123, 0.851, and 1.861 μm, respectively. Measurements of spectroscopic properties, fluorescence kinetics, and laser performance of these ions in YAlO3are reported."
"The possibility of light-pulse generation from junction lasers due to inhomogeneous excitation by an external magnetic field is discussed on the basis of the repetitivelyQ-switching model. The pulsation takes place with suitable choices of the current and the magnetic field. The pulsewidth and period increase with the magnetic field."
"Over 80 kW of peak power has been obtained on the combined visible lines of a pulsed xenon ion laser. Light pulse shapes of the strongest lines are discussed."
"The role of helium in TEA CO2lasers differs from that in low-pressure CO2lasers. TE CO2laser output is nearly proportional to the gain-bandwidth product, and, at a total pressure of 250 torr, it is independent of whether helium is present or not. Above 250 torr, the laser could not be operated without helium."
"A novel method is devised to determine the small-signal gain, saturation intensity, and internal optical losses in the cavity of a homogeneously broadened laser with the help of an intracavity rotatable reflector used as a variable coupling-out mirror. These laser parameters have been determined for a CW CO2laser."
"Experimental results on the first miniature Nd:YAG laser end-pumped by a single incoherent infrared-emitting diode are given. Laser operation was verified by measurements of relaxation oscillations, angular divergence, wavelength, and nonlinear output. In order to emit in the 0.81- μm pump band of Nd:YAG, the GaAs1-xPxdiode required cooling to 88 K (-185°C). Cooling the diode increased its efficiency while cooling the rod decreased the pump power necessary to reach threshold. With both laser mirrors highly reflecting at 1.06 μm, the maximum pulse powerP_{D}^{th}emitted by the diode at threshold was 6.2 ± 1.2 mW. The diode power required for laser threshold at room temperature was derived and compared with more recent experiments. Miniature size and long-lived solid-state components make this laser attractive for further development."

"The expansion of sparks produced in various gas mixtures by a helical TEA CO2laser of modest power (∼ 0.5 MW) has been examined using time-resolved photography and two-wavelength interferometry. The latter was accomplished with the aid of a synchronized ruby laser, the fundamental and second-harmonic frequencies of which illuminated a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The interferograms have been analyzed using Abel inversion techniques and two-dimensional profiles of the electron density within the sparks obtained."
"A technique for operating a tunable laser simultaneously at two wavelengths has been applied to the infrared HF chemical TEA laser. The two output beams are independently tunable, collinear, and have mutually perpendicular polarizations. Because of collisional coupling between the vibrational-rotational (V-R) levels, the effect of stimulated emission on one set of levels can strongly affect the gain on a different transition."
"The coupled Maxwell-Schrodinger equations are used to describe propagation of a pulse in a nonlinear absorbing medium. The absorber is assumed to be comprised of a homogeneously broadened system of two-level atoms that are exactly resonant with the field. Numerical calculations have been performed for incident pulses of hyperbolic-secant shape and of duration that is long compared to the atomic phase-memory time. Selected values of input intensity are considered. For intensities below a certain level the calculations nearly agree with rate-equation predictions, but as the incident intensity is increased we find that optical nutation comes into play. The nutation effect leads to pulse breakup as the packet penetrates into the medium. An analytical calculation, for the case of an applied optical field of step-function form, has been performed in order to provide additional insight about the intensity threshold for nutation."

"Broad-band acoustooptic modulators have been designed and developed for fiber optical-communication applications. The specific function of these modulators is to impress signal information, up to 50 Mb/s, on the CW emission of Nd:YAG lasers."
"A CO-laser-pumped InSb CW spin-flip Raman laser has been operated in a permanent magnet (∼1500 G) incorporating a field gradient that permits frequency tuning by moving the magnet relative to the InSb sample. Output lines up to the fifth Stokes and the second anti-Stokes are observed. Real-time Doppler-limited absorption spectroscopy employing a small external modulation coil is demonstrated."
 "Preliminary results are reported of a joint experimental-theoretical study of time delays andQ-switching effects in homostructure and heterostructure lasers. Spectral measurements of the normal lasing andQ-switching pulses indicate a broadening of the spectrum during the delay, with a high-energy emission during theQ-switched output. These experimental results are interpreted on the basis of a theoretical model involving saturable absorption of the lasing emission via states in the conduction band \"tail,\" while the emission itself results from transitions associated with states in the parabolic part of the conduction band for temperatures above a certain critical temperature Tc."
"Lasing characteristics were measured for several double-heterostructure (DH) wafers with lower (\\lsim10^{16}/cm3) and higher (p \\approx 10^{19}/cm3) carrier concentrations to those that were reported previously by Pinkas et al. The new data give additional support to the assumption that the major lasing-loss mechanism is the free carrier absorption."
"CO and CO2laser action are achieved by organic molecule electrochemical oxidation in a directly excited, subsonically flowing, CW gas laser. The laser spectrum shifts from 5μ (due to CO) to 10.6 μ (due to CO2) as the cooling temperature is increased from 77 K to -40°C. Both CO and CO2are reaction products formed by the electrochemical oxidation of CH4, C3H3, C2H2, or HCHO."
"The effects of mirror misalignment in a confocal unstable resonator are interpreted in terms of beam steering or deflection in the output beam. Exact mode solutions for a resonator with a Gaussian output mirror lead to an expression for the far-field beam-steering angle as a function of the magnification and Fresnel number of the resonator. This solution reduces to the geometric result when the Fresnel number exceeds 10, for output couplings greater than 50 percent. An expression is derived that relates the beam diameter, the mirror vibration amplitude, and the far-field beam divergence. Numerical values are presented that show that in order to prevent the far-field intensity of a 10.6-μm laser beam from being degraded by a factor of two, the product of the mirror vibration angle and the beam diameter should typically not exceed 220 μrad-cm."
"The addition of helium increases the output of both pulsed and CW H2O lasers. Spectroscopic time-varying gas temperature measurements in pulsed H2lasers show that the gas temperature rise of ∼1600 K in \"pure\" H2O is reduced to only ∼200 K when helium is added. Evidence is presented, indicating that the increase in output when helium is added is primarily due to gas cooling."
"The development of a new transverse electric discharge scheme has permitted the excitation of large volumes of CO2, N2, and He mixtures with beam cross sections up to 60 cm2in area. The scheme utilizes as a preionizer a sheet of small arc discharges produced prior to the main discharge and situated behind a perforated anode. Time-resolved photography establishes that rapid volumetric ionization of the gas between the electrodes occurs concurrent with the formation of these arcs. This behavior is consistent with a preionization mechanism depending upon UV photo-excitation of the gas. A parametric study has shown that reproducible discharge conditions in 30 percent CO2gas mixtures are obtained with input energies of >300 J.I-1, resulting in energy extraction efficiencies of ∼10 percent and an average small-signal gain of ∼4.3 percent cm-1. The laser is modular in construction and, when a number of discharge modules are employed in series in a simple oscillator configuration, energies of ∼300 J with peak powers of several gigawatts are obtained."
"Experimental verification has been obtained for a theory governing the output power of high-gain laser oscillators and a procedure is described for determining the saturation power of high-gain gas lasers. The experiments were conducted using a 3.51-μ xenon laser."
"When an acoustooptic modulator is used for laser-cavity dumping, an amplitude modulation of the light output at twice the acoustic frequency can result. When the laser is also mode locked, this modulation can be readily observed with a relatively slow detector. In addition, the modulation can be utilized to increase the fraction of the light dumped from the laser."
"Measurements are reported of the Lamb dip on 16 vibrational-rotational lines of low-pressure CO lasers. The experimental curves are fitted to a theory that takes into account velocity-changing collisions of the lasing molecules. The inhomogeneous and homogeneous linewidths, velocity-changing collision rate, and saturation intensities are determined for a gas mixture typical in sealed-off CO lasers."
"An antiresonant ring-mirror configuration, the optical analog of a microwave reentrant hybrid tee, is suggested for several potential laser applications including coupled laser cavities, variable laser output coupling, intracavity harmonic output coupling, mode locking, cavity dumping, and pulse code modulation."
"A method of calculation of the output power of a continuous dye laser was extended to reveal the magnitudes of the various internal losses and their power dependences and to optimize the output mirror transmittance. The results guided modification of the laser cavity to achieve increased output."
"Time-resolved spectra of an internalQ-switching emission of electron-beam-excited GaAs lasers were measured. The spectra shifted to longer wavelengths at the rate of 5.63 Å/ns at 85 K. Time-resolves spectra of a normal laser emission were also measured to be shifted to longer wavelengths at the rate of about 0.3 Å/ns. This remarkable difference of the spectral shifts can be understood if the former shift is caused by the quasi-Fermi level in the conduction band and the latter shift is caused by thermal effects."
"Passage of a\\sim10^{9}W/cm23470-Å mode-locked laser beam through a few torr of Cs vapor results in efficient parametric conversion of pump light into beams of ultrashort pulses at wavelengths located near the ∼ 3600-Å6s-9pand ∼ 3900-Å6s-8pCs resonance lines. In addition, ultrashort pulses at roughly ten different infrared wavelengths lying between ∼ 6 and 20μ are produced. The four- and six-wave parametric processes responsible for the conversion are initiated by stimulated electronic Raman emission."
"Oscillation at 1.318 μ in Nd3+:YAG, at a peak power level of 1 MW in a 50-ns pulse is reported. In addition, simultaneous laser oscillation was achieved in the same laser cavity at both 1.06 and 1.318 μ."
"By insertion of two intracavity solid Fabry-Perot etalons into a traveling-wave dye ring laser an instrumental line width of 0.1 pm was attained in single-mode operation. Using different dye solutions, convenient tunability was possible within the wavelength range from 440 to 700 nm."
"Partial saturation and change of the slope of the spontaneous emission are observed in CW homostructure GaAs lasers and pulsed homostructure and DH GaAs lasers at the onset of the laser modes. An important new effect that we have observed is a reduction of the spontaneous emission above threshold for homostructure lasers. The results are discussed in comparison with the previously published work and a possible explanation for the difference of behavior between homostructure and DH lasers is proposed."
"A detailed study has been made of the lasing properties of p+-n-n+double heterojunction lasers where the n-type active region was lightly doped n type (\\sim 2 \\times 10^{16}cm-3) and only weakly compensated. The structure of the diodes allowed a study of the spontaneous emission (below and above lasing threshold) through the nonabsorbing higher band-gap (AlGa)As surface of the diode. Only a single major spontaneous band is seen which peaks near the band-gap energy of the n-type active region. (However, when viewed only through the diode edge, a second spurious lower energy \"ghost peak\" is seen due to selective internal absorption of the spontaneous radiation in the GaAs substrate.) With increasing current density, the spontaneous emission band broadens with a slight upward shift in its peak energy. The lasing peak eventually emerges from the low-energy tail of the band at an energy where relatively little spontaneous radiation is observed at low current densities and where the absorption coefficient is relatively small. Observations made by cathodoluminescence of GaAs with similar doping shows an analogous behavior, with the energy separation between the spontaneous and lasing peaks increasing with increasing temperature between 77 and 300 K. The observed behavior is consistent with the hypothesis that the lasing transitions involve conduction and valence band tail states due to the screening of the crystal field (and carrier interaction) by the high density of injected carriers in the active region of the laser."
"Experimental studies have been made of the spectral change with excitation and the linewidth of room temperature (Ga Al)As-Ga As heterostructure lasers. The lasers with stripe geometry configuration show uniform near-field patterns and single axial mode operations in relatively wide ranges of current levels. Continuous output powers of several to 20 mW (from one facet) have been obtained under single axial mode operations at current levels below 500 mA. Experimental data on excitation-dependent spectral change indicate that the laser line is homogeneously broadened and the diffusion of the inverted population plays an effective role in the single-mode operation at room temperature. Observations of the interference fringes with a Fabry-Perot etalon having plate separations of the centimeter range revealed the frequency variation with time under continuous operation. Probably this effect is the reflection of a very large temperature coefficient of the laser frequency at room temperature, Full linewidths shown in the photographs of the fringes taken with exposure times of about 1 s were less than several hundred megahertz, which is compared with the theoretical estimate of a few megahertz at several milliwatts."
"This paper shows the design advantages of using four- and five-layer heterostructure lasers in order to separately optimize the optical distribution and carrier confinement for a particular application. Given an arbitrary gain/carrier density relationship the parameters can be optimized for minimum threshold current. Theoretical results for both wide optical cavity and close confined lasers are given. These show the optical distributions for four- and five-layer lasers and how the threshold current varies with the active region width. Experimental results report a reduction from 55° half-power polar diagram width to 32° by the addition of a fourth layer to increase the optical cavity width of a double-heterostructure laser. The threshold current against reciprocal length characteristics for three- and four-layer devices are considered in terms of the theory given and hence a plot of gain against injected carrier density is obtained that extends over an order of magnitude of gain."

"The pulsing behavior of the double-section laser diode has been discussed using the nonlinear rate equation in a small-signal approximation and a trial-function approximation concentrating on the maximum repetition rate. It has been shown from the small-signal approximation that the double-section diode must exhibit an appropriate amplification coefficient to give rise to the sustained pulsations even if it has an amplifying and absorbing section and that the maximum repetition rate becomes very high for a particular amplification coefficient that decreases with increasing population inversion in the absorbing section. Nonlinear rate equations have been analyzed using the trial function approximation for the laser diode with an amplification coefficient expressed in a logarithmic function. The maximum repetition rate is approximately given in a simple form and is shown limited within a few gigahertz."
"The effect of uniaxial pressure perpendicular to the junction on the threshold current of GaAs double-heterostructure lasers and homostructure lasers operated at room temperature was studied. The threshold either first increases with pressure up to a certain critical pressure Poand then decreases, or decreases with pressure from the beginning, depending on whether the laser is operating in a TE or a TM mode with zero pressure. In the first case, the change in the threshold current behavior at Pois accompanied by a change of modes from TE to TM. This behavior is explained by a model, taking into account the splitting of the valence bands of GaAs on application of uniaxial pressure."
"An optical device exhibiting both a time versus frequency and a space versus frequency dispersion has made possible the performance of 1) the pulse by pulse spectrum analysis of mode-locked Nd-glass laser trains and 2) the shaping of these pulses by a completely passive process. The relatively poor performance of this spectrum analyzer (7 spectral lines resolved) is essentially due to the rise time of the photodetection setup utilized in the experiments. The shaping consists in a preliminary pulse expansion (from picoseconds to nanoseconds), which gives linear FM long pulses whose envelopes are then modulated with a rise time of 50 ps by a spectral filtering simply obtained by diaphragms and neutral filters."
"Single-mode (SM) laser radiation from a GaAs diode is obtained using a composite cavity which can be tuned to select a desired spectral mode. The properties of a laser with such a cavity are described. The kinetics of the spectra of the single-mode strip double-heterostructure laser is investigated with a high time resolution (10-10s) spectrometer apparatus. At sufficiently high currents above threshold a transition from SM to multimode operation occurs with breaks in the stable SM oscillation. Such an event is accompanied by a frequency self-modulation of the oscillation with a self-induced intensity pulsation at the same microwave frequency. Multimode oscillation appears simultaneously with the pulsation of the radiation, and the SM output power is limited due to such pulsations."
"Data (77 K) onx = 0.41andx = 0.46N-doped GaAS1-xPxare presented showing that the electron-hole recombination probability may be resonantly enhanced when the crystal composition is varied and the\\Gammaconduction band minimum is made degenerate, or nearly degenerate, with theA-line N isoelectronic trap state (E_{\\Gamma} \\approx E_{N} \\sim 2.0eV,x \\approx 0.40). Data onx = 0.46GaAs1-xPx:N suggest that resonant enhancement occurs in a \"turning\" range|E_{\\Gamma} - E_{N}| \\leq 55meV. A consequence of this work is that photopumped GaAs1-xPx:N (x = 0.46) exhibits laser operation at the unusually high photon energy of 2.032 eV (6100 Å, orange). The idea of resonance-enhanced recombination and the results now demonstrated in GaAs1-xPx:N are general enough to be applicable also to p-n junctions."

"Fabrication and characteristics of mesa-stripe-geometry double-heterostructure injection lasers are described. Two types of lasers have been prepared: 1) low mesa-type lasers in which mesa etching is stopped just above the active layer and 2) high mesa-type lasers in which mesa etching is effected up to the first epitaxial layer (n-GaAlAs). The stripe widths of these lasers can be narrowed below 30 μm without an appreciable increase of the threshold current density. As a result, very low current operation has been realized. The thermal resistances of these lasers are nearly as low as those of stripe-geometry lasers. This property along with the low threshold current density renders it easy to operate diodes continuously at and above room temperature. Near-single-mode operation has been observed in low mesa-type lasers. The laser emissions display TE polarization in most cases; however, diodes with thick active layers have often been observed to show TM polarization."
"The pulse modulation of DH-(GaAl)As lasers at a bit rate of 200 Mbits/s was examined. To reduce the variation of the lasing pulse peak and lasing delay time due to combinations of \"1\" and \"0\" bits, prepumping condition and the damped oscillation parameters are important. The spontaneous carrier life time of DH-(GaAl)As lasers was measured as 2-5 ns."
"In order to avoid parasitic modes that frequently occur in conventional rectangular lead-chalcogenide diode laser structures, stripe junction lasers emitting at about 11 μm at 4.2 K have been fabricated from vapor-grown Pb0.88Sn0.12Te. Measurements of spectra, polarization, mirror illumination patterns, and far-field patterns provide conclusive evidence that these lasers emit in a fundamental spatial transverse mode. The emission spectra of the stripe lasers consist of regularly spaced modes corresponding to the longitudinal cavity with an effective index of refraction of 7.1. The measured width of the emitting region closely corresponds to the junction width both for the 50- and 100- μm-wide stripe lasers used. The depth of the emitting region perpendicular to the junction plane was measured to be approximately 50 μm in all of the lasers. As2S3dielectric coatings of various optical thicknesses have been sequentially applied to one end face in order to evaluate the gain and loss parameters of the active region from the threshold variation with reflectivity. Loss parameter values of 12-54 cm-1, gain parameter values of 0.084-0.24 cm/A, and internal quantum efficiencies of 0.013-0.055 are deduced from these measurements. In addition, the antireflection coating produced as much as a fourfold increase in output power at currents above threshold."
"Optically pumped lasers operating at 2 K and emitting between 3.9 and 8.6 μm have been produced from PbSxSe1-xcrystals of several alloy compositions. Because the lasers operate with large bandwidths, the results demonstrate that only a small number of properly selected compositions would be needed to completely cover this spectral region."
"A construction of a semiconductor laser with longitudinal pumping which has been called a radiating mirror was proposed and experimentally realized in [1]-[4]. Using this scheme of excitation one can obtain rather high radiation powers with a good directionality."
"A metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) sandwich structure is proposed for use as a pulsed laser. A theoretical analysis relating to the feasibility of the MIS pulsed laser structure is presented. The field distribution and allowable TE and TM modes in the optical cavity are calculated using techniques of Anderson and Butler. The three MIS structures detailed are chosen to correspond as closely as possible to junction laser geometrics of Kressel and Hawrylo, and Hayashi et al., where precise lasing thresholds are published. Realization of the MIS laser will require improved process control of surface states for 1) low Qssand 2) minimum charge injection into the gate dielectric."
"The investigation of the propagation modes in a homostructure GaAs laser and particularly of the spatial displacement of the TE and TM mode is reported. For this investigation, a homostructure GaAs laser was operated in an external optical cavity and experiments were performed where the resonator alignment was varied to displace the image of the p-n junction, formed in the optical cavity, from the p-n junction of the laser diode. The peak power of the laser radiation (which is in the TEM00mode), the delay, the optical waveform, and the polarization were measured at room temperature for different cavity alignments. For the evaluation of the propagation modes the experimental results are correlated with the computed field distributions of the modes in a three-layer dielectric waveguide."
"Measurements have been made in the manner in which device parameters vary during forward-biased operation of GaAs double-heterostructure lasers. The threshold current increases, but the slope external efficiency remains relatively constant. A conclusion is that optically absorbing or scattering centers are not the cause of degradation. The increase of threshold is attributed to an increasing nonradiative recombination component, the defect responsible for which is not yet determined. The important question regarding the role of optical flux is examined and it is shown that this is not the cause of the observed degradation in device characteristics."
"Due to the high dispersion near the band gap, normal mode locking cannot occur in usual semiconductor lasers. According to the Paoli-Ripper model the pulse properties of such lasers can be explained in terms of second-order mode locking. We present an analytical quantitative treatment of the Paoli-Ripper model and apply the results to the GaAs laser diode. A rather good agreement between theory and experiment is achieved."
"A general formula for the transverse fundamental mode of oscillation (FMO) in a semiconductor laser is found, taking account of the saturation effect. The formula is applied to two specific cases, and the oscillation condiditions are discussed in detail for typical geometries, including the mesa-stripe geometry."
"Room-temperature pulsed operation of GaAs cleaved platelet lasers bulk optically pumped near the band gap by a tunable parametric oscillator has been studied as a function of several variables. Both n-type high-purity GaAs (1.6 \\times 10^{14}cm-3\\leq N_{d} + N_{a} \\leq 1.6 \\times 10^{16}cm-3) and n-type Si-doped GaAs (N_{d} - N_{a} \\simeq 2-5 \\times 10^{18}cm-3) have been investigated. The peak of the laser emission at threshold for all samples occurred in the range from 0.88 to 0.89 μm, but the total width of laser emission in the Si-doped samples was significantly broader than in the pure samples. As the pump photon energy Epdecreased, the threshold power necessary for lasing increased. This is ascribed to the increasing penetration of the pump radiation and the consequent decrease in excess carrier density, and to the lower degree of population inversion as the pump photon energy approaches the threshold quasi-Fermi level separation necessary for stimulated emission. For the high-purity samples, the lasing behavior did not depend heavily on impurity concentration and was more strongly a function of surface and cleaved-facet quality of individual samples. Typical threshold power densities of 1.75 W/mil (corresponding to approximately7 \\times 10^{5}W/cm2) were measured and at an incident power level of twice threshold, peak power conversion efficiencies up to 4.5 percent were obtained. Measurement of a typical far-field angular mode pattern showed a full-width half-maximum power (FWHM) transverse angle of about 10°, corresponding to an emitting depth perpendicular to the pump face\\sim5 \\mum. At higher excitation, stimulated emission was observed over a width of 150 Å. Measurements on the Si-doped material showed marked differences from the high-purity n-type samples. At the lower pump energies used on the high-purity samples, the GaAs:Si samples were more transparent, and consequently, higher pump energies had to be used to obtain lasing. Thresholds comparable to those in the pure GaAs were measured, and lasing occurred at roughly the same wavelength as before. However, at a pump power twice threshold, stimulated emission occurred over an increased range from 0.88 to 0.91 μm, a width of 300 Å, and the measured FWHM angle decreased to 6°. Peak power conversion efficiencies up to 11 percent have been obtained. This material seems to be quite promising for obtaining efficient bulk optical pumping, with the advantages of lower optical flux densities at the resonator faces and better spatial mode quality."

"A new design for the nanosecond response time room-temperature thin-film bismuth bolometer has resulted in much improved responsivity and sensitivity characteristics. A responsivity of2.20 \\times 10^{-2}V/W and a sensitivity (NEP) of5.0 \\times 10^{-8}W/Hz1/2is reported. This is an improvement by a factor of 45 for the responsivity and a factor of 70 for the sensitivity over that previously reported for the bismuth-silver bolometer."
"This issue of the IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics contains papers presented at the 1972 IEEE Semiconductor Laser Conference, plus other papers on semiconductor lasers. The purpose of this special issue is to bring together current semiconductor laser papers in a convenient volume. The two previous special issues on this topic (April 1968 and June 1970) have been of great help to workers in the field by providing convenient references on almost all the device aspects of semiconductor lasers. The 1972 IEEE Semiconductor Laser Conference was held on May 15-17 in Boston, Mass. The Conference was attended by 66 specialists from the US and abroad. The program of the 1972 IEEE Seıniconductor Laser Conference is supplied."
"Saturation of the spontaneous emission intensity from stripe-geometry double-heterostructure junction lasers has been observed for currents from threshold up to three times threshold. The present observation of saturated luminescence depends upon the spatial uniformity of the saturated gain obtained in a laser with a thin active region (\\sim0.2-0.3 \\mum) and weak optical confinement. In lasers with thicker active regions (\\sim1 \\mum) and stronger optical confinement, the spontaneous emission does not saturate at threshold but continues to increase with current at a reduced rate. The increasing emission is shown to originate in spatial regions where the field intensity is low and consequently the gain is not saturated. At pumping levels high above threshold, the nonuniform saturation of the gain (transverse spatial hole burning) leads to increased gain and finally oscillation for other transverse modes."

"The second-harmonic generation nonlinear optical susceptibility of trigonal tellurium has been measured at 28.0 μm by the phase-matching technique. The value obtained was|d_{11}| = (5.7 \\pm 1.9) \\cdot 10^{-10}m/V in MKS units. This value establishes the longest wavelength \"standard\" for the measurement of nonlinear optical susceptibilities by comparative techniques. Experimental details and data are given to justify the quoted uncertainty."
 "This paper describes the measured result of intense violet emission at 4048 Å that is due to the strong coherent two-photon excitation in potassium vapor. Anomalous delay and narrowing of the emitted pulse was observed in contrast to the incident pulse. The intensity dependence on the atomic density also is reported."
"It is shown that the small-scale filaments generated by laser pulses in nonlinear media are the natural consequence of moving foci. Results of many controlled experiments performed with single-modeQ-switched laser pulses agree very well with the predictions of the moving focus model. The earlier experimental results on filaments reported in the literature are also shown to be consistent with the moving focus model. In the picosecond case, this model appropriately modified, gives essentially the same description as the so-called dynamic trapping model, which explains qualitatively the observed filament characteristics in that limit."
"The properties of a new class of lasers are investigated theoretically and experimentally. In these lasers, the radiation propagates radially within a disk-shaped amplifying medium resulting in high fields and symmetric illumination at the resonator axis. Experiments have been conducted using a pulsed CO2TEA configuration."
"The small-signal gain and saturation intensity in a waveguide CO2laser are determined by means of a least squares curve-fitting technique. The method allows the simultaneous estimation of the two parameters from an arbitrary number of data points relating power output to the incidence angle of an internal coupling plate."
"This paper considers third-harmonic generation in phase-matched mixtures of alkali metal vapors and inert gases. Calculations show that the combination of near-resonant nonlinear susceptibilities, the ability to phase match, and the relatively high UV transparency of these vapors should allow high conversion efficiency for picosecond laser pulses with a peak power of 108-109W. Calculations of the nonlinear susceptibility and of the ratio of xenon atoms to metal vapor atoms which is necessary to achieve phase matching are given for each of the alkalies as a function of incident laser wavelength. Processes that limit the allowable peak power density and energy density are discussed and guides for determining the metal vapor pressure, cell length, and beam area are given."
"Following the Letokhov model for passive mode locking, which describes the buildup of ultrashort light pulses from noise, the statistical behavior of passive mode locking and the discrimination characteristics of the nonlinear absorber are examined. The probabilityWof having a second ultrashort pulse of a certain intensity within the resonator round-trip time2t_{L}is described. This probability is essentially a function of the initial dye absorption coefficient x0and a pumping parameter tpthat is a measure for the excitation rate of the optical pump. Experimental results are reported that confirm these theoretical considerations."
"A novel discharge circuit for the pulsed excitation of a double-discharge grid-cathode TEA-CO2amplifier is described. A distinctive feature of this circuit is the use of an underdamped preionizing discharge, together with a slow rate of electrical energy injection in the amplifying medium. Significant improvements in the stability and uniformity of the discharge is obtained by increasing the pumping period to the2-6 \\mus range. Small-signal gain coefficients up to 0.035 cm-1are achieved in a5 \\times 5 \\times 50cm3discharge volume with an electrical input energy density as low as 120 J/l. Details concerning the design and operation of the circuit are given. The temporal dependence of the gain upon circuit parameters, gas mixture composition, and electrical energy input is studied, and an investigation is made of the spatial gain distribution and optical homogeneity over the amplifier cross section. Measurements of the gain-saturation characteristics with a 2-μs probing pulse indicate a value of5.8 \\times 10^{-20}cm2for the stimulated emission cross section."
"Pulsation in a coupled-cavity structure (CCS) semiconductor laser, in which laser cavities are placed parallel with optical coupling between them, has been observed. The mechanism is simulated by solving rate equations for a model with two stripes of different emission energies. The pulsation in the simulation is based on the resonant oscillation, which originates in the nonlinear interaction between the electromagnetic field in the laser cavity and the population inversion, in cooperation with the perturbations caused by repetitively occurring optical pumping and quenching. Important parameters to define the properties of the pulsation are emission-energy difference, coupling coefficient, and excitation levels."
"The multiphoton dissociation probability of heteronuclear diatomic molecules by intense infrared radiation is calculated under the assumption that the energy level spacing of the molecule is nearly regular. The values found are in reasonable agreement with experimental dissociation thresholds. The extension of the theory to homonuclear diatomic and polyatomic molecules is discussed."
"Some methods for improving the efficiency of electrically initiated HF lasers are discussed. Measurement of the laser pulse shape produced by 30-ns discharges in SF6:C2H6at several mixtures and pressures is reported. These pulse shapes are compared to the laser and current pulses produced by a two-stage Marx bank that gives laser pulses of 1.4 J with 3.1-percent electrical efficiency from an active volume of 0.331. A second bank is described, which gives pulses up to 3.5 J with 1.8-percent efficiency, with a peak power of 35 MW."
"We have measured the magnitude and absolute sign of the nonlinear optical coefficient in AgI to determine the importance of thed- electron contributions to the nonlinearity. The resultsd_{31} = +20.6 \\times 10^{-9}ESU andd_{33} = -41.1 \\times 10^{-9}ESU are in good agreement with theory."
"This correspondence describes the design and performance of a high-average-power longitudinal-flow Nd:POCl3liquid laser. In the long-pulse-mode of operation, 12-J pulses at 1.45-percent efficiency were obtained. At 30 pps, the laser produced 336 W of average power. Single 3-J pulses, 50 ns wide, were obtained at a repetition rate of 5 pps when the laser wasQswitched with two synchronized rotating prisms. This is the highestQ-switched energy reported for liquid lasers to date."
"An output of 500 kW peak power at 3371 Å and 25 pps is obtained from a pulsed nitrogen laser. A water capacitor is employed for energy storage, resulting in a simpler laser construction. The pulse duration is 10-15 ns, providing very high energy for pumping ultra-narrow-band dye lasers."

"An analysis of single-mode internally frequency-modulated gas laser oscillation is presented. The modulation is achieved by variation of the index of refraction of the medium within the cavity. The analytical treatment follows the Lamb formalism. It is shown that modulation bandwidth is not limited by the cavity bandwidth. Limitations by other factors (e.g., linewidth of the active medium) are not treated."
"An HF chemical laser with a 10-cm-long active volume has been constructed for operation at high pulse repetition rates using TE excitation. Up to 7.2 W of quasi-CW power were produced at 1100 Hz.

"The vibration-vibration energy transfer of CO2gas initially excited to the first asymmetric stretch level (0001) has been observed. Collisional pumping to the (0111) combination level is measured by monitoring the fluorescence due to the (0111) → (0110) band. The rate constant for the process: CO2(0111) + CO2(0000) → CO2(0001) + CO2(0110) is found to be(5.3 \\pm 1) \\times 10^{6}s-1torr-1."
"Effects of substitution by auxochromic groups on the electronic spectra of aromatic compounds are discussed. Depending on the location and direction of the singlet-singlet (S-S) relative to the triplet-triplet (T-T) oscillators within the molecular frame, substitution by an auxochromic group may cause T-T absorption bands to move into or out of the fluorescence region, or they may be left unchanged. Predictions can thus be made of potential dye laser materials based on substitutional effects on the spectral properties of aromatic compounds. The predictions are incorporated in a graph that presents possible arrangements of low-energy SS oscillators relative to a T-T oscillator located in the fluorescence region of the aromatic compound. Depending on short- or long-axis substitution, the red shifts of the S-S and T-T absorption bands result in two promising constellations (structures) for low T-T absorption over the fluorescence region. The laser action properties of coumarin and some of its derivatives are discussed."
"A discussion of the transverse mode selection in the conventional double-heterostructure injection lasers is given. The mechanisms considered as responsible for mode selection are 1) the nonnormal incidence in the plane perpendicular to the junction of the EM waves at the end faces; and 2) an uneven gain distribution across the active region. By using a multilayer waveguide model, results are presented that show the regions of preference of each of the modes as determined by each mechanism both in isolation and simultaneously. Hence, the regions of dominance of each mechanism are determined."
"Demonstrations of diffraction-limited performance from a CW diffusion-type HF chemical laser are reported. A novel type of edge-coupled nonconfocal unstable resonator consisting of a convex mirror and a diffraction grating is used. A new technique of coupling power out of an unstable resonator different from the edge coupling previously suggested by Siegman is also applied. This consists of coupling power out directly through the diffraction grating zero-order radiation. By this technique, a large fraction of the total power is concentrated within the diffraction-limited main lobe. Peak power levels of the order of 100 W have been achieved on a single line [P_{2}(5)] for flow conditions yielding approximately 1 kW in closed cavity measurements."
"In many uses of lasers, the minimization or elimination of power reentering the laser is necessary to ensure its stability. It is pointed out here that the frequency-shifting properties of an acoustooptic light deflector can be used for this purpose. By using the deflected beam from a Bragg deflector, stability of the laser is obtained when the frequency of the acoustic wave is chosen such that the frequency(ies) of the light reentering the laser, shifted by twice the acoustic frequency from the light leaving the laser, does not correspond to a cavity resonance. Experimental results demonstrating this isolation property are presented and are found to be in general agreement with other results of injection locking of lasers."
"The application of the Wallis and Pomerantz electrostatic sealing technique to low-temperature glass-to-glass vacuum tight optical window seals is discussed. The successful sealing of vacuum tight quartz optical windows to quartz tubing at the Brewster angle is described and problem areas are defined. A brief discussion of the sealing mechanism is given and the general equations are defined."
"The experimental results of our studies of metal evaporation under powerful optical radiation are presented. The theory of this phenomenon based on a liquid-vapor phase transition is developed. An approximate solution of the Clapeyron-Clausius equation is applied to the present problem. The method permits calculations of metal surface temperature versus incident light intensity I0. When a certain critical intensity is exceeded (I_{md} \\sim 10^{7}-10^{8}W .cm-2) a new effect is shown to arise due to disappearance of the metallic properties of the target. The new effect is a \"transparency wave\" in whose front a liquid metal turns into a liquid dielectric. ForI_{0} > I_{md}it is the surface \"transparent\" (dielectric) layer that is evaporated. Its temperature is no longer raised and it remains below a critical value. This layer is separated from the metal by the transparency wave front, which propagates towards the interior of the metal. The transparency wave causes some other effects to arise, such as a sharp drop of the reflectivity from the metal surface, an essential change in the dependence of the observed evaporation front speed on I0, and, finally, occurrence of a maximum on the curve of specific recoil impulse versus I0. These other effects may be used to identify the transparency wave. The experimental results support some corollaries of our theoretical model. The vapor dynamics of metal evaporation under powerful millisecond optical radiation are investigated. Vapor heating near the target under laser light has been observed. The initial conditions of vapor motion are studied. From the gas-dynamic measurements the mass flow of the gas phase j1is calculated. The dependence of j1upon the incident light intensity is indicative of the fact that the metal surface has attained the temperatureT = T_{md} < T_{cr}, which corresponds to the liquid metal-liquid dielectric transition."
"Zero-power gain measurements in a supersonic diffusion-type CW HF laser have been made using a pulsed HF probe laser. A peak zero-power gain of 10 percent/cm was measured on aP_{2}(3)vibrational-rotational transition and 7 percent/cm on aP_{1}(6)transition for flow rates corresponding to 1.8 kW of closed-cavity power. The variation of zero-power gain with rotational quantum numberJfits a simple rotational equilibrium model indicating increasing rotational temperatures with increasing distancexfrom the nozzle exit plane. The model also indicates a total inversion forx \\leq 0.2in for theP_{2}(J)transitions and a partial inversion further downstream."
"The performance characteristics of a continuously pumped doubly resonant optical parametric oscillator have been studied in detail. Using barium sodium niobate as the nonlinear material threshold for oscillation, as low as 3 mW has been observed. At higher pump power levels an efficiency exceeding 50 percent and a tunable output power of nearly 80 mW (signal plus idler), have been achieved. The effect of frequency stability of the pump on oscillator performance has been studied with single-mode operation and ±20-percent amplitude stability attained. The effects of cavity-length perturbations on oscillator performance have also been studied. It is found that cavity-length changes of\\frac{1}{4}wavelength (250 nm in this case) can produce tunability of the output frequency by as much as 100 cm-1. These results as well as their interpretation and implications on the design of doubly resonant optical parametric oscillators are discussed."
"The frequency response characteristics of metal-insulator-metal (MIM) diodes used for direct-frequency measurements in the submillimeter and infrared spectral region have been determined and it is found that these may be described by a simple model based on aerial impedance and barrier shunt capacitance.

"The model formulated for the operation of a dye laser electronically tuned by an acoustooptic filter in Part I [1] is reduced to ar analytically soluble form by assuming that the power spectrum is Gaussian with an amplitude, width, and center frequency that are time dependent. Nonlinear coupled ordinary differential equations for these quantities are derived. Two modes of operation are distinguished depending on the various parameter values. In the first case, the dye saturates and the output is laserlike, whereas in the second it is amplified fluorescence. For both cases we obtain steady-state values of spectral bandwidth, power, net saturated dye gain at filter center, and spectral shift from filter center. The transient analysis, although incomplete, yields insight into device behavior for both cases."
"A spatially periodic variation in machined hole size was observed when thin bismuth films were irradiated with pulses cavity dumped from a Nd3+:YAG laser. When one of the two colinear extracted beams was blocked in the cavity, the variation disappeared. The effect is caused by a reflection-induced cavity instability that arises from fluctuations in the film-effective reflection, occurring asynchronously with the dumping rate as the beam is swept across the film. The reflection isolation needed to achieve stable operation is established and results for two isolation methods are given."
"The linear coupled-wave analysis of a distributed-feedback laser is presented for nonzero reflectivity at the ends of the lasing medium. Numerical results are given for the case of real coupling coefficients and the threshold behavior, as the reflectivity effects dominate, is described."
"Laser action from triply ionized xenon has been found to occur during the dynamical contraction of the xenon plasma column. Laser lines between the near ultraviolet and the orange portion of the spectrum have been detected. Their peak powers, time of occurrence, duration, wavelength, and coherence length have been measured. Optimum currents and pressures have been found and compared with other published results. In addition, a simplified model of a pinching plasma has been used, in conjunction with streak camera pictures of the contracting column and time-resolved interferometric measurements of the electron density to estimate electron temperatures. Values of the electron density, temperature, and conductivity of the xenon plasma compare well with published results applicable to high-current pulsed-argon ion lasers."

"Four individuallyQ-switched laser cavities have been established sharing a common ruby laser rod. Single giant pulses have been emitted with a time duration of ≈ 30 ns (half-width) and energies of 0.16 J from each cavity apertured by a 2.54-mm-diameter hole. The spacing of the pulses was continuously variable in time from 0 to 1.25 ms plus or minus a jitter time of approximately 13 ns. This multiple-cavity laser light source can be used as a stroboscopic illuminator for photographic or holographic recording of fast events."

                             "In this paper a new design of the electrooptic light modulator is proposed, which uses the diffraction of a laser beam caused by the periodic skin field behind a electroded surface of an electrooptic crystal at the moment of the total internal reflection. Interdigital modulation electrodes are attached to they-zsurface of a LiTaO3single crystal. The number of electrode pairs per unit length, the width of a single electrode, and the effective area are 4800 m-1, 20μm, and 50 mm2, respectively. The effective full-modulation voltage and the capacitance between the opposite readout of the modulator were measured to be 18 V and 44 pF, respectively. These values are proved to be in good agreement with those obtained by the theoretical estimations. At the Gaussian limit case a design of the modulator under a restricted driving power requirement is also indicated."
   "Results of theoretical calculations for a high-pressure electrically excited pulsed CO laser oscillator are presented and compared with experimental data obtained from anE-beam-stabilized device.

"Further results obtained with a modified conventional laser tube design are reported. Laser oscillation in both the visible and the middle infrared regions of the spectrum was obtained with this device. Nine new pulsed and CW infrared laser lines in neutral argon, krypton, and xenon were obtained and identified. All the visible laser lines observed corresponded to known noble gas ion laser transitions."
 "Output pulse observations are presented for a helium-diluted HF laser pumped by the H2+ F2chain reaction. Initiation of the reaction was accomplished with 180 transverse electrical discharges. Addition of a trace of O2to the gas mixture was found to enhance performance. Optimum performance was found with a 120-torr mixture with mole ratio F2:H2:O2:He = 1:0.7:0.08:15 initiated with a 22.5-kV 250-pF discharge; this gave a single-pulse output energy of 0.073 J. This corresponds to a ratio of laser output energy to electrical input energy of 115 percent."

A simple optical technique is shown for dispersing an optical beam so that each frequency component passes through the appropriate part of a transversely adjusted gap (TAG) laser. A TAG laser can be constructed by subjecting a GaAs injection laser to a transverse thermal gradient. Calculations indicate that such a device would have a bandwidth of20 \\times 10^{12}Hz for a 25-fold increase compared to a conventional GaAs injection laser. An analysis of optical ray angle and spatial-dispersion alignment tolerances is presented. Two TAG-laser subsystems-a multiplex modulator and an amplifier-are proposed and discussed to indicate how the TAG laser's larger bandwidth and spatial dispersion may simplify optical communication systems. A preliminary-test TAG-laser oscillator has been constructed and tested. It verified the basic concept and exhibited a bandwidth of2.45 \\times 10^{12}Hz as predicted by the model."
"An infrared-sensitive streak camera, capable of resolving optical pulses of durations of ∼3 ps, has been used to analyze the temporal development of the individual picosecond pulses in a mode-locked pulse train. A progressive increase in the duration of the individual pulses throughout the pulse train is observed, the rate of increase in the pulse duration being an approximate quadratic function of the optical field. In addition, temporal analysis of the laser output signal, dispersively delayed with the aid of a grating pair, confirms the existence of phase-modulation effects during the development of the mode-locked pulse train."
"Plasma parameters in the He-CdI2positive column used for an I+ laser were measured using a probe. The presence of iodine seems to partially cancel the influence on the electron temperature of the Penning process which is very dominant in the He-Cd positive column."
"In several recent papers, attention has been given to the Fresnel reflectivity associated with cleaved facets of the laser. The small dimensions of the heterostructure waveguide give rise to a considerable angular spread in the energy incident on the facet. As a result, the mode reflectivity is not given simply by the Fresnel equation, which is only valid for an infinite plane wave. Rather, it is a properly weighted average over the plane-wave distribution of the mode. The differences in mode reflectivity with respect to TE and TM modes, as well as the variations with mode number, have been offered as a possible explanation for the predominant appearance of TE modes and preference for higher order modes in the large optical-cavity (LOC) geometry. However, the considerations to date have ignored the finite extent of the field in the junction plane. This situation is rectified in this paper. It is shown that the splitting in the mode reflectivity values between TE (electric field in the junction plane) and TM (electric field perpendicular to the junction plane) modes is reduced, and under certain conditions TM modes can be favored. In particular, it is shown that if a TE mode is oscillating, then there is a preference for a lowest order mode in the plane of the junction and a highest order mode in the transverse plane. Conversely, if for some reason a TM mode is oscillating, then the preference is for highest order modes in the plane of the junction and lowest order modes in the transverse plane."
"The voltage obtained from metal-barrier-metal (MBM) diodes by phase-sensitive detection when illuminated with optical and near-infrared radiation, modulated at 880 Hz, has been studied as a function of an applied dc bias. The detected voltage is a nonlinear function of the bias voltage for high junction impedances, and linear for low junction impedances. The nonlinearity in the junction has been shown to be consistent with electron tunneling theory."

"The pressure dependency of the performance of the NF3-H2chemical-laser system has been evaluated. The laser energies at various chemical compositions and initiation discharge energies are presented as functions of Pressure. Overall efficiency, laser pulsewidth, and effects of additive gases are also presented. For all compositions the laser energy maximized at a pressureP_{\\max}which was observed to be dependent on the pulsewidth of the initiation discharge. At pressures belowP_{\\max}the laser energy was proportional to the partial pressure of NF3or H2. No change in slope of the laser energy versus pressure curve was observed in going from low-pressure nonexploding regimes to high-pressure exploding regimes, implying that the reactions causing the explosion did not contribute to the lasing. Lasing usually occurred in two peaks, the first containingHF(V=2) \\rightarrow HF(V=1)lines and the second containingHF(V=3) \\rightarrow HF(V=2)andHF(V=1) \\rightarrow HF(V=0)lines. These data indicate that lasing is due to the reaction sequence: 1)NF_{3} + e^{-} = \\cdot NF_{2} + F\\cdot + e^{-}; 2) F\\cdot + H_{2} = HF+(V) + H\\cdot; and 3)HF+(V) + h\\nu = HF+(V-1) + 2h\\nu."
"CW laser action at both the 5- and 10.6-μm wavelength regions has been achieved simultaneously from CO and CO2molecules in a slowly flowing mixture of He-air-CO. Two dc discharges through the premixed gases within a segmented laser cavity were used to provide molecular excitation and generate CO2molecules by discharge-initiated CO oxidation. Both liquid nitrogen and room-temperature water cooling were used concurrently. A total power of about 2 W has been achieved with approximately half the power in each wavelength region."

 "The linear (small-signal) and nonlinear temporal response of CO2laser media was studied. Experimental results of the amplification of optical pulses whose duration is comparable to the inverse gain-bandwidth of the amplifying medium are described. Pulse narrowing, a consequence of nonlinear amplification, was observed. Computer calculations based upon a two-level model incorporating phenomenologically CO2rotational level coupling are compared with experimental observations."
"The second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility in the low-frequency limit for Group III-V and II-VI semiconductors can be understood in terms of a very simple and yet surprisingly accurate molecular-orbital model of the tetrahedral bonds of the crystal. The physical origin of the nonlinearity is the field-dependence in the ionicity of the bond due to the transfer of valence charge from one atom to the other forming the bond in the presence of the applied field. The sign of the second-order nonlinear susceptibility is directly related to the polarity of the permanent electronic dipole moment of the valence charge distribution on the bond."

"Experimental measurements are reported of optical gain due to stimulated transitions between the lowest-bound diatomic states of xenon (Xe) and the repulsive ground state. The optical gain was greatest at a wavelength of (1730 ± 10) Å, where the effective gain cross section is estimated to be7 \\times 10^{19}cm2."
 "The behavior of the degree of polarization of the fluorescence and transmission versus intensity of complex molecules in high-viscosity solvents has been studied. We show that, in the usual case, when the electronic transition can be represented as a linear oscillator, molecules excited at low field have an anisotropic distribution; then, at high field, the distribution becomes isotropic. So, the relation between the transmission of the solution with intensity differs significantly from the transmission versus intensity relation derived by using the mean value of the cross section."
"A simple transversely excited N2laser of novel electrical design, working at relatively high pressure and only 45-cm active length, has been constructed. It produces about 0.5 mJ/pulse of UV radiation at 337 nm and has a peak power in excess of 200 kW. Optimization data and parameters of the excitation circuit are presented."
"Experimentally determined 90° phase-matching temperatures, as a function of optical wavelength, for second harmonic generation in a number of KDP isomorphs are discussed. The data are applicable for SHG of tunable dye laser radiation to cover the UV spectral range of about 260-360 nm."
"Calculations have been made of time delays in semiconductor lasers, using a rate-equation approach to describe the transient behavior of photon and electron populations. Three possible models were considered in order to try to explain the delays: a) saturable absorption via conduction-band tail states in equilibrium with the band, with the lasing emission occurring via transitions from the band states; b) saturable absorption via conduction-band tail states not in equilibrium with the band; and c) absorption due to loss of waveguiding as a result of hole injection into the n-type regions of diode lasers. It was found that only the model b) was capable of satisfactorily accounting for the known properties of time delays."
"A superluminescent diode (SLD) which simultaneously generates incoherent optical radiation and amplifies this radiation has been made from double-heterostructure (DH) AlxGa1-xAs-GaAs material previously used to make lasers and light-emitting diodes having superior characteristics. The device configuration was similar to that of the stripe-geometry DH injection laser, except that optical feedback was suppressed by providing absorption for the backward waves in the cavity. A single-pass gain device resulted. The stripe contacts were 12.5 μm or 25 μm in width, and from 0.125 to 1.5 mm in length. The single-pass gain was found to be proportional to (e^{\\betaL} -1)/\\beta, where β is a gain coefficient depending on the pump current andLis the stripe length. The structure was found to favor low-order modes, and the half-power radiation beam angle in the junction plane was measured to be6-10\\deg. The radiation field was slightly TE polarized, and it exhibited a spectral width of 50-85 Å. When operated in the pulsed mode, the longest diodes (1.5 mm) radiated 60-mW peak power at a peak-current density of 6.5 kA/cm2(2.5-A current) and about 10 mW at 3 kA/cm2. The external differential quantum efficiency was 3.5 percent. Due to the relatively narrow radiation pattern of the SLD, more than 80 percent of the radiation from this source has been coupled into a multimode optical fiber with a numerical aperture of 0.63. These measured characteristics were found to conform to those calculated on the basis of a simple model."
"A type of light deflector that shows ultrahigh resolving power is proposed. This light deflector consists of arrayed electrooptic prisms. The resolving power of this deflector isNtimes larger than that of a single electrooptic prism, whereNis the number of arrayed prisms. If the voltages applied on each crystal are all the same, the deflecting angle is discontinuous. But if the voltages are not equal to each other, it can be continuous. Experiments were done using a simple deflector. The experimental results agreed with the theory. The experimental deflector showed 50 resolved individual spots when maximum applied voltages were ± 600 V. It is clear that we can have a light deflector that shows over 600 resolvable spots easily. Current techniques are sufficient to manufacture such deflectors."
"The low signal gain of a CW water-vapor laser at 28 μm was measured as a function of the discharge current and pressure. Together with the measurement of other quantities such as the axial electric field and the concentration of OH, a partial interpretation of the mechanisms involved in pumping the 28-μm transition was possible. Thermal equilibrium between the ν0,2\\nu_{2}, and ν3vibrational levels will result in a large absorption at the elevated gas temperatures observed (800-1000 K). The strong dependence of gain on the electron temperature strongly suggests that the vibrational excitation proceeds through electron-impact excitation. Only the electron-impact excitation of H2O is quantitatively capable of overcoming the large thermally induced absorption. Although vibrational-excitation transfer from H2to H2O seems insufficient, by itself, to overcome this absorption, it may provide appreciable additional gain. Pumping of the 28-μm line through electron-ion recombination and by reactions involving OH can be ruled out."
"A pulsed HCN laser with transverse excitation is described. The variation of the output energy with length of the active medium is in agreement with the theory for homogeneously broadened lasers."
"The output properties of a pulsed He-Kr+ ion laser have been investigated as a function of partial gas pressure and discharge current. Variations of the time delay between the peak of current and laser power suggest that population inversion is not only ruled by upper-level pumping but also by the decay of lower laser level."
"The operation of a CW CO2laser is reported in which a flow-conditioning technique is used to produce a uniform discharge at atmospheric pressure with a specific input in excess of 500 J/g. In this technique the premixed gas is introduced radially at sonic velocity through a narrow gap adjacent to the upstream electrode. A theoretical and experimental examination of the conditions for the appearance in the discharge of fine filaments, which can be regarded as incipient arcs, gave an insight into the method of operation of the technique. A laser is described that uses a cascade of six 0.2-m-long 19-mm-ID discharge tubes in which the gas flow, discharge, and optical axes are along the length of the tubes. The output power of 530 W at about 5-percent efficiency was limited by the difficulty of power extraction from the low-gain, high-saturation-flux medium."
"The emission characteristics of the coumarin-dye 4-Methyl-umbelliferone (4-MU) are investigated by studying the low-intensity fluorescence spectra and the laser-pumped gain spectra for various solvents and pump powers. A total of five different forms were found to exist, each of which can be isolated in a proper solvent. Of the five species, I is the neutral molecule, two others (II and V) are results of ground-state reactions, while two (III and IV) are produced by excited-state reactions and do not have a stable ground state. By proper adjustment of the solvent a number of combinations of the five forms can coexist and lase together, giving rise to a variety of gain spectra and allowing the possibility of \"tailoring\" a desired gain curve over most of the visible spectrum. Comparison of the gain and fluorescence spectra indicates the presence of triplet or excited-state losses in some of the forms, yields comparative values of emission parameters, and reveals an acidity-dependent quenching of one of the excited-state species."

"A compact formula is given for the Goos-Haenchen shifts occurring for total internal reflection of light from anisotropic media. This is used in a coupled-wave analysis of polarization conversion in thin-film waveguides deposited on optically birefringent substrates. A numerical example illustrates the considerable influence of the Goos-Haenchen shifts on the conversion length."
"Second-harmonic generation of the 496.5-nm, 501.7-nm, and 514.5-nm lines of the argon laser has been achieved. This was done by 90° phase matching in an ADP crystal at temperatures of -93.2°C, -68.4°C, and -10.2°C, respectively."

"An He-Cd-Se laser has been constructed [1]. It provides a possibility for the separate and simultaneous oscillation of Cd II-4416-Å and Se II-4976-, 4992-, 5068-, 5176-, and 5227-A lines."
"Fast closed-cycle transverse flow can be achieved in metal-vapor lasers by means of an evaporation-condensation cycle, with gravity return of the condensate. A small double-pulsed copper-vapor laser utilizing this technique operates at rates in excess of5 \\times 10^{4}pps."
 "Several beat frequencies in the range below 6 GHz have been measured using a C12O216laser and a C12O218laser operating on several pairs of closely spaced lines in the 9.3-μm region."
"The high-resolution and broad tuning-range capabilities of semiconductor lasers under hydrostatic pressure are demonstrated. GaAs diode lasers operating under pulsed chirped mode conditions at 77 K are used to obtain Doppler-limited absorption spectra of several6s \\rightarrow 6ptransitions in xenon atoms excited in a hollow-cathode discharge. The hyperfine structure so obtained is in agreement with previous spectral studies of xenon isotopes using conventional emission interferometric and RF beam techniques."
"Mode locking and frequency tuning of a CW light-focusing Nd : glass laser called the SELFOC Nd : glass laser were achieved. Using an acoustooptic modulator having a modest degree of modulation (about 3 percent), almost perfectly mode-locked pulses as short as 49 ps were obtained. Pulsewidth was measured with an intensity-correlation method using the second-harmonic generation in KDP. Most of the observed shapes of the intensity-correlation curves were in agreement with theories previously presented by several authors. When the laser was mode locked, the long-term averaged optical spectrum was observed to narrow considerably. Some experimental evidence that the CW SELFOC Nd:glass laser could be considered to have a homogeneously broadened line was also found. Frequency tuning was achieved by using a tilted etalon in a cavity. When a 50-μm-thick etalon was used, the tuning range was more than 40 Å. Pulses obtained from a frequency-tuned mode-locked laser were as short as about 100 ps."
"A theory for the initial rate of second-harmonic generation (SHG) in planar optical waveguides for phase-matched and nonphase-matched cases is derived. The derivation is carried out both by a ray treatment and by a wave treatment and the results of the two are compared. Although formally and from the point of view of physical interpretation the two treatments look very different, the final results are the same if allowance is made for the Goos-Haenchen shift. Dependences of the amplitude of the second harmonic on the amplitude of the fundamental Aωand on distance are quite similar to those for bulk SHG even though the phase-matching condition is quite different. Determining the characteristics of some of the phase-matched modes, we find that, for the same Aω, it is possible to obtain a generation rate in waveguide comparable to that in the bulk. The highest generation rate is achieved, as expected, with both fundamental and harmonic having mode number 0. Phase matching can be achieved in this case without birefringence and with all three media having normal dispersion. The decrease in generation rate in going to mode pairs other than 0,0 is less than a factor 2 in some cases."
"A 5-kJ electron-beam pulse has been used to drive an SF6-C2H6- fueled chemical laser to produce 60-J 600-ns pulses with 100-ns rise time."
"Theoretical expressions are given for the enhancement of second-harmonic generation (SHG) that can be expected from mode-locking in the case of intracavity frequency doubling."
"Solutions of the mode problem of an optical waveguide with a square-law medium are usually based on the scalar wave equation. An exact derivation of the wave equation from Maxwell's equations results in an additional term containing the gradient\\nablan^{2}of the square of the refractive indexn. It is the purpose of this correspondence to evaluate the change of the propagation constants of the modes of the square-law medium that is caused by the\\nablan^{2}term. We find that the change is significant only for TM modes of low order, but insignificant for all other modes of a dielectric slab with parabolic index distribution."
"Starting with a perturbation expansion for the Kleinman forbidden nonlinear optical coefficientd_{ijk^{F}}and for Miller's\\Delta_{ijk^{F}}, and making several approximations, we arrive at a simple result for the ratio of forbidden to allowed mixing nonlinearities (\\omega_{1} + \\omega_{2} = \\omega_{3}), namely\\Delta_{ijk^{F}}/\\Delta_{ijk^{A}} \\propto (\\omega_{3}^{2} + 2\\omega_{1}\\omega_{2}). For second-harmonic generation (SHG) this can be expressed as\\Delta_{ijk^{F}}/\\Delta_{ijk^{A}} \\simeq (\\omega/\\chi)(\\partial\\chi/\\partial\\omega), which clearly shows the close connection between\\Delta_{ijk^{F}}and the linear dispersion. These expressions are shown to give good agreement with literature experimental values, as well as for our measurements on TeO2for various input frequencies ω1and ω2(i.e.,\\omega_{3} = 1.88, 2.33, 2.82, 3.50, and 3.76 eV)."

"The performance of 18 NF3+ hydrogen-donor reactant systems has been determined in a pin-discharge HF chemical laser. Laser energy, laser pulse shape, and the time delay between initiation and lasing were measured in experiments with all 18 reactant systems; lasing lines were measured in 9 systems. It was found that, in general, saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons produced the most laser energy, other hydrocarbons produced less laser energy, and inorganic hydrides produced the least laser energy. Rates of hydrogen abstraction by fluorine atoms have been determined from calculations based on pulse-shape data for the hydrogen compounds used in this study. Ten of these rates have not previously been reported."

"A general theory of finite-aperture waveguide-laser resonators is developed which represents the external reflectors by matrices which couple linearly polarized waveguide modes having the same azimuthal symmetry. The theory allows the determination of resonator efficiency, resonator frequencies, and laser near- and far-field patterns. Computations of the coupling loss for the fundamental waveguide mode as a function of mirror curvature, separation, and aperture are in good agreement with recent infinite-aperture calculations in the limit of large apertures and indicate three low-loss configurations: 1) large radius of curvature mirrors close to the guide; 2) \"large\" radius of curvature mirrors centered at the guide entrance: and 3) generally smaller curvature mirrors separated by half their curvature from the guide entrance. The importance of higher order waveguide modes in determining laser output power and far-field patterns is demonstrated experimentally and compared to theoretical predictions. Design guidelines for the construction of high-efficiency CO2, CO, and He-Ne waveguide-laser resonators are summarized in tabular form."
"Large aperture high-pressure gas laser discharges are a prerequisite for the development of high-energy gas lasers of sufficient power for the production of plasmas of thermonuclear interest. Of the several approaches being followed toward the attainment of such discharges, one utilizing weak volumetric preionization of the active gas region produced by UV radiation is described. The use of this technique has resulted in the successful generation of atmospheric-pressure CO2laser discharges between electrodes separated by 30 cm, having total cross sections of ∼600 cm2. With input energies of ∼200 J/1 small signal gain values of 4-5 percent cm-1were measured in 1 : 1 : 3 gas mixtures of CO2, N2, and He, respectively. It is thus concluded that this excitation technique could be incorporated into the fabrication of large volume gas laser amplifiers having beam cross sections in excess of 103cm2and total output-energy capabilities of\\sim 10^{4}J."
"The experimental evidence presented confirms the existence of a statistical nature in the laser-induced intrinsic damage process both in the bulk and on the surfaces of transparent materials. A damage process determined by an electron-avalanche breakdown with statistical starting properties was found to be consistent with the data. The importance of irradiating only a small volume of the material in order to avoid studying inclusion-induced laser damage is discussed. In addition, a new procedure was developed to permit rapid identification of the occurrence of damage due to an intrinsic process."
"The problem of propagation and interaction of optical radiation in dielectric waveguides is cast in the coupled-mode formalism. This approach is useful for treating problems involving energy exchange between modes. A derivation of the general theory is followed by application to the specific cases of electrooptic modulation, photoelastic and magnetooptic modulation, and optical filtering. Also treated are nonlinear optical applications such as second-harmonic generation in thin films and phase matching."
"An analysis is made of the mode structure of lasers when the interaction with the active medium is taken into account. We consider the combined effect of gain and refractive-index variations for arbitrary mirror configurations. Using a dimensionless round-trip matrix for a medium with a quadratic variation of the propagation constant with distance from the optic axis, dimensionless beam parameters are derived in terms of cavity and medium parameters. Beam waist and radius of curvature are obtained explicitly as a function of a dimensionless parameter containing the variation of propagation constant, wavelength, and cavity length. The spot size depends only on the absolute value of the gain variation, whereas the deviation of the radius of curvature of the beam from the mirror curvature changes sign when the sign of the gain variation is reversed. As long as radial gain variations are present stable oscillations can always be obtained for any set of curved and/or flat mirrors. For large gain variations the spot size and radius of curvature of the outcoming beam become independent of mirror curvatures."
"Crystal-field split energy levels for the5Fand5Iground configuration of Pm3+in LiYF4and radiative transition probabilities between these levels were calculated. An electric dipole φ-transition dominates and suggests a CW Pm3+laser is possible unless Pm3+-Sm3+-Nd3+energy transfer quenches the Pm5+flurorescence. This dominating transition is from the5F_{1}\\Gamma_{1}at 12444 cm-1to an5I_{5} \\Gamma_{2}at 1786 cm-1"
"A new method for measuring the self-focusing parameters of transparent materials is reported. The technique consists of using lenses with different focal lengths to induce intrinsic bulk damage at low powers where catastrophic self-focusing is absent and then comparing the results to analytical calculations. Using this technique, the self-focusing parameters for sapphire are determined."
"The recovery time of a new saturable absorber suitable for mode locking of neodymium lasers has been measured and compared with the recovery of two commonly used saturable dyes (Eastman 9740 and 9860)."
"Gain and output power of sealed-off waveguide CO2lasers are presented as a function of gas mixtures and total gas pressure. Experimental data on circular-bore and square-channel waveguide lasers are presented. Output power per unit length of 0.2 W/cm is achieved for both types of lasers in agreement with gas-discharge scaling laws which are presented. Saturation intensities as high as 24 kW/cm2are inferred from the data. The effects of the optical properties of the waveguide wall material on the waveguide losses are discussed and theoretical waveguide loss versus wavelength is presented for BeO, Al2O3, and fused silica."
"The stability of a multiple-loop feedback system cannot be guaranteed by considering only its characteristic equation as suggested by Sedra et al. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given."
  "For a general linear time-invariant network it is shown that the sum of the sensitivities, of any order, of a network function over different parameter sets is invariant. An expression is derived for calculating the sum of(k+l)th-order sensitivities knowing the same forkth-order sensitivities. It is also shown that lower bounds for the quadratic sensitivity index may be obtained by using the firstorder sensitivity invariants."
"A network configuration consisting of a resistive twoport bridged by a lossless one-port is considered. It is shown that in certain cases this configuration is capable of realizing a voltage transfer function equal to that of a constant-resistance passive lattice. As a special case, conditions are derived on the two-port parameters for the structure to be all pass. It is determined that a single transistor suffices to realize the two-port network, thus resulting in a very simple all-pass structure; only one coil, one capacitor, and one transistor are necessary to realize a second-degree all-pass voltage transfer function. Higher order transfer functions can be realized by adding anLCbranch per each additional second-order factor to the same transistor circuit. In the second-order case, losses in the coil can be compensated. In higher order realizations coil losses cannot be compensated, but a design technique which achieves an arbitrarily close approximation to the desired all-pass transfer-function is presented. Methods of cascading lower order sections are discussed and experimental results are given."
"The definite drawback of the active RC network over its equivalent LC network is the fact that the former consumes power. There are so many papers which deal with synthesis methods and sensitivity of activeRCnetworks, but very few of these papers treat their power problems. The minimum necessary power which is supplied by all amplifiers in the feedback-type RC active network is described. First, we deal with the minimum power of the feedback-typeRCactive network containing ideal transformers, then the minimum power of the network without any ideal transformer is given. It is also shown that we can always realize any transfer function with the minimum power network. An illustrative example is given to compare the minimum power of a practical network."
"A highly versatile second-order active-filter building block for low-Qapplications(Q < 25)is described. The versatility is obtained by combining features inherent in the Sallen-Key circuit topology and those pertaining to hybrid-integrated circuits (HIC's). A high degree of circuit stability is obtained by designing individual network functions to depend primarily on the characteristics of stable thin-film resistors and capacitors. Frequency- andQ-sensitivity are examined in detail. Methods of minimizingQ-variation with respect to the active and passive elements are discussed. Lower bounds on the Q-variation obtainable with the hybrid-integrated filter building blocks are given. All possible second-order network functions, including the allpass function, can be obtained with the building block. The resulting universality and standardization permit the complete design of active filters consisting of cascaded building blocks by computer."
"The MUltiple Critical ROot MAximally Flat (MUCROMAF) polynomials are defined. Their behavior is maximally flat at the origin (as the classical Butterworth polynomials), while the multiplicity of the critical root pair (the nearest toj\\omega-axis) is higher than one: then the polynomial degree is higher and the critical root pairQ-factor is lower than those of the analogous Butterworth polynomials. Thus they are useful to approximate the RC active-filter pattern without finite transmission zeros and with low sensitivity."
"The use of the second-generation current conveyor as the active element in realizing all-pass transfer functions is illustrated by two circuits."
"A new method is presented for obtaining network functions in which some, none, or all of the network elements are represented by symbolic parameters (i.e., symbolic network functions). Unlike the topological tree enumeration or signal flow graph methods generally used to derive symbolic network functions, this new process uses fast, efficient, numerical-type algorithms to determine the contribution of those network branches not represented by symbolic parameters. A computer program [Network Analysis Program Using Parameter Extractions (NAPPE)] that incorporates all of the concepts discussed in this paper has been written. Several examples illustrating the usefulness and efficiency of NAPPE are included."
"A circuit model is used to present the basis forthe existence of complex propagation constants and backward wave modes in lossless coupled dispersive transmission lines. In particular, for the 2-line lossless case, conditions for realizing complex modes, as well as the possible forms for the\\omega-\\betadiagram are given. Methods for approximating the mode behavior of lossless waveguide systems, uniform in the propagation direction, but with transverse plane inhomogeneities, are presented using coupled-line models. These methods are derived from the Schelkunoff representation of such a waveguide structure by an infinite set of coupled TE and TM dispersive transmission lines. The techniques used in this paper depend on an approximation which reduces the infinite number of lines to a finite number. One approximation method interpolates the parameters of a realizable 2-line system to approximate the behavior of the infinite line system up to a frequency in the vicinity of the secondlowest eigenmode. A second method is a systematic network procedure for eliminating coupling ports of the infinite structure so as to obtain a finite number of coupled lines to approximate the mode behavior. These two methods are illustrated by 2-line models for round waveguide loaded with a dielectric rod. The mode behavior of the loaded guide is surprisingly well approximated by both the 2-line models."
"The 2-port parameters of 4-terminal networks are often known. It is then simpler to supplement them rather than carry out a renewed complete analysis. A method is described for the analysis of linear reciprocal timeinvariant networks in terms of three parameters characterizing their behavior with respect to two disjoint ports and three further \"balance\" parameters, which are essentially open-circuit admittance parameters, thereby giving a complete description of 3-port 4-terminal networks. In the transmission line case the balance parameters are obtained as solutions of two-point boundary value problems, which in most common applications have simple solutions. The effects of parallel, series, and cascade connections of such networks are also investigated and the results can be regarded as generalizations of the cases satisfying the Brune conditions."
"An optimal method is proposed for approximating any square integrable time function by the impulse response of a multilayer RC distributed network. The performance index to be minimized is the square integral error. The method results in achieving, for the same number of layers, a better approximation than that obtained by the existing suboptimal technique."
"A synthesis procedure is presented for a lossless positive real impedance matrixZ(s). The procedure, based on a choice of a suitable state-space representation forZ(s), uses the minimum possible number of reactive elements and, simultaneously, the minimum possible number of gyrators."
"A general method based on the Laplace expansion for determining the transfer function of a wide variety of linear electronic circuits is discussed. The technique developed requires only the calculation of a number of driving-point resistances to specify the coefficients of the transfer function. Dominant-pole techniques are used and extended, making the procedure useful in both analysis and design. As computation only involves resistance networks, complex arithmetic is not required in determination of the response."
"An iterative method is proposed for obtaining a solution to the problem ofl_{p^m}approximation by exponentials. The method always converges and has the advantage that the samples need not be equidistant. Using the proposed method and allowingpto increase yields, in a much easier way, results that are comparable to those obtained by Fischl for the Chebyshev approximation."
"Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the compactness of the open-circuit impedance (or short-circuit admittance) matrix of a passive reciprocal RC two-port network when the specified short-circuit admittance (or open-circuit impedance) matrix of the network is compact. The conditions are applicable to unsymmetrical as well as to symmetrical reciprocal RC two-ports."
"Brown's procedure for the synthesis of annth-order symmetric positive entry matrix as the resistance matrix of ann-port network is extended so as to make it applicable to matrices having negative and zero entries also."
"An easy-to-use formula is derived for measuring the response time of various systems. This formula also gives lower bounds for the settling time of the response for a very large class of input signals. Lower bounds for the rise time of certain responses have also been found."
 "A recurrence relation and an explicit solution for the number of spanning trees in a multigraph wheel with unequal numbers of spokes and rim edges are given. Previous results can be identified as special cases of the general enumeration and the solution for one new specific case is included."
"The criterion for invulnerability of a network based on the connectivity of a graph is well treated in literature. We define a criterion for survivability of a network in terms of the independence number of a graph. The following problems are then considered. 1) Find anr-connected graph, withnvertices andm_0 = [(nr + l)/2]edges, whose independence number is the minimum possible, where[x]denotes the greatest integer less than or equal tox \\cdot 2) Given positive integersn,m,r, andk, find the realizability conditions for a graph withnvertices andmedges, whose connectivity is at leastrand independence number is at mostk."
"This paper considers the problem of designing networks whose function is the simultaneous transmission ofkindependent signals overkvertex-disjoint paths (k-transmission). All paths are assumed to consist of two edges and to traverse an intermediate vertex (bus). Necessary and sufficient conditions are given, lower bounds are established, and optimal designs are exhibited."
"The properties of traditors are examined and a classification system for traditor types is established. It is demonstrated than ann-degree basic traditor can be defined by2^nLagrangians which yield2ndifferent traditor types."
"As of this issue, the items published in this TRANSACTIONS are classified in three categories: papers, short papers, and letters-to-the-editor. Distinction between the first two categories will be exclusively on length, i.e., contributions that can be adequately described in less than about three pages of print will be considered short papers. Letters-to-the-editor will contain comments on previously published items, corrections, and other comments from our readers. In fact, we wish to encourage our readers to write to us-whether for publication or not-and tell us how they liked a particular issue or article, what they would like to see written about, and what they see as some of the more promising problems of engineering interest."
"The closed-form solution is derived for the scattering transfer functionS_{12}(p)of a resistively terminated lossless reciprocal two-port prototype network of degree2nwhich satisfies the following constraints:|S_{12}(j\\omega) | \\leq 1|S_{12}({\\pm}j{\\omega}_i) | = 1 , i = 1 \\rightarrow n\\arg S_{12}({\\pm}j{\\omega}_i) = \\pm \\psi({\\omega}_i), i = 1 \\rightarrow nwhere the\\omega_iare arbitrary and\\psi(\\omega)is any odd function. The solution is obtained in terms of the arbitrary phase polynomials of the first and second kinds, which are capable of being generated through simple recurrence formulas."
"The effect of digital implementation on the gradient (steepest descent) algorithm commonly used in the mean-square adaptive equalization of pulse-amplitude modulated data signals is considered. It is shown that digitally implemented adaptive gradient algorithms can exhibit effects which are significantly different from those encountered in analog (infinite precision) algorithms. This is illustrated by considering the often quoted result of stochastic approximation that to achieve the optimum rate of convergence in an adaptive algorithm the step size should be proportional to1/n, wherenis the number of iterations. On closer examination one finds that this result applies only whennis large and is relevant only for analog algorithms. It is shown that as the number of iterations becomes large one should not continually decrease the step size in a digital gradient algorithm. This result is a manifestation of the quantization inherent in any digitally implemented system. A surprising result is that these effects produce a digital residual mean-square error that is minimized by making the step size as large as possible. Since the analog residual error is minimized by taking small step sizes, the optimum step-size sequence reflects a compromise between these competing goals. The performance of a time-varying gain sequence suggested by stochastic approximation is contrasted with the performance of a constant step-size sequence. It is shown that in a digital environment the latter sequence is capable of attaining a smaller residual error."
"A method to reduce the overshoot of the step response of a low-pass filter by including in that response a constant times its second derivative is considered. A technique to determine the value of the constant that minimizes overshoot is presented and applied to four conventional filters. Results of the modification procedure are presented."
"The designs of low-pass equiripple filters employing lumped, as well as distributed, elements are obtained by numerical methods. The number of ripples is restricted to be equal to the number of elements in the filter. The solution of a set of simultaneous nonlinear equations gives the element values directly. The technique has been used to design a wide variety of filters of practical interests."
"Spectral modes for the generalized transform are developed. These spectra are invariant to cyclic shift of the input sequence and possess sequency resolution in their squared terms. They cannot, however, be called energy spectra as there are cross terms, some of which are negative."
"A tutorial discussion is given on the relation between the shape of the transition (rise) time versus length curve and that of the frequency domain attenuation. An analysis is developed in terms of hypothetical cable attenuation responses having a frequencyfdependence off^m, wheremis a constant0 <m < 1. It is shown that if thef^mlaw prevails, then the transition time depends on the lengthlasl^{1/m}. Practical applications are made toRG 58C/U, RG 59B/U, andRG 63B/U."
"Properties of continuants under differentiation are investigated and closed-form formulas are obtained for the differentiation of the ratio of two continuants with respect to an independent parameter. These results are applied to the sensitivity analysis of ladder-type as well as certain nonladder-type structures."
"A new approach to star-polygon transformations is introduced. For star-connectedR-networks and for a certain class of polygon-connectedR-networks the \"terminal value\" is defined. This concept allows for an elegant derivation of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a polygon-into-star transformation. The related formulas appear to be simple and easy to remember. More important, the terminal value turns out to be a useful tool in the search for planar equivalents and in the recognition of transformable polygon structures. Simplicity is the only reason for the restriction to resistance networks. The study of the general RLC case does not bring out any new aspects."
"It is shown that if a bandpass filter is obtained from a prototype low-pass filter by the usual low-pass to bandpass transformation, the white-noise margin and the(1/f)^2noise margin of the resulting filter will be identical to the white-noise margin of the prototype low-pass filter. A method for using this general result for evaluating some types of integrals that arise in noise calculations is indicated."
"A general expression is presented for the frequency\\omega_0of the delay maximum of an all-pass resonator composed of an active bandpass resonator and a summing amplifier. This expression is a function of the resonant frequency and pole-q. Through an example using the multiple feedback bandpass resonator, a procedure is presented for aligning the delay response of the corresponding allpass circuit without monitoring delay."
"This paper proves a new min-max optimum property of the impulse invariant method. In proving this, a method of digital filter design for band-limited inputs is also given. The design is carried out in the time domain."
"A general expression is established which relates the output roundoff noise generated by a fixed-point multiplier in a digital filter to the sensitivity of the filter attenuation with respect to the corresponding multiplier coefficient. It confirms that filters with low sensitivity of the attenuation also produce less roundoff noise."
 "Two well-known active all-pass networks can be arranged to give a constant-resistive input impedance at one of their ports merely by making two resistance values equal. Sensitivity to termination errors is thus reduced with no sacrifice in the basic properties of the network."
 "A synthesis procedure is proposed for designing RC active filters containing grounded gyrators and negative impedance convertors. Under suitable hypotheses, the sensitivity to variations of the component values of these filters is shown to be equivalent in the passband to that of traditional reactive-passive filters. Moreover, an approximate formula is derived under the same hypotheses for calculating the output noise power in the passband. Measured results of a prototype are included."
"The electrical noise performance of generalized impedance converter (GIC) low-pass ladder structures is derived. The concept of frequency-dependent negative-resistance (FDNR) elements has allowed low-sensitivity high-order low-pass ladder structures to be realized directly from the corresponding LC prototype. The electrical noise appearing at the output of the low-pass FDNR realization is derived for the equiterminated low-pass Butterworth realization, and it is shown that the output noise power spectral density may be obtained from a suitable noise model of the GIC. Experimental verification of the output noise spectral density is given."
"Exact realizations of input impedances with substantially frequency-independent phase angles over a finite frequency range are given in the form of linear distributed RC structures. The theory of these networks is outlined and some results concerning their design and performance are given."
"Time domain synthesis of linear networks requires approximation of functions with a finite sum of weighted exponentials. In this paper an error function, obtained by orthonormal filtering, suitable to numeric optimization, is evaluated. The error function is the integrated squared difference between the obtained function and the desired one. The procedure can be used to form an optimum set of basis exponentials to an ensemble of functions. Finally, the procedure is illustrated with some simple examples."
"The problem of minimal realization of a biquadratic transfer function possessing a pair of complex zeros in the left-half complex plane with maximum gain constant posed earlier by Lin and Siskind has been attempted. For the solution of this problem, a systematic synthesis procedure has been adopted and a relevant realizability theorem has been stated and proved. It has been possible always to realize the theoretical maximum value of gain constant. Furthermore, several examples show that the method requires fewer elements in comparison with other well-known methods."
"A method is presented for automatic computation of transfer functions approximating to a quadratic phase characteristic in an equiripple manner for any prescribed minimum phase error. The program is based on a recently introduced method for the approximation of a linear phase characteristic in which only linear equations are involved. The characterization of the best nonlinear Chebyshev approximation of an arbitrary phase characteristic is discussed and it is shown that the necessary and sufficient conditions are fulfilled for the resulting solution to be unique and to represent the best Chebyshev approximation of a quadratic phase characteristic. By suitable modification the procedure described can also be used for determining the equiripple approximation of a linear slope group delay characteristic."
"The explicit formulaZ_m =m(m +1)/2is proved for the characteristic impedances of a cascade ofntransmission lines whose open-circuited voltage transfer function is optimally designed to compress a time-limited signal by the factorn+1. In the proof, use is made of the relationship between the synthesis procedure and the generation of sequences of polynomials orthogonal on the unit circle through a recurrence formula. Furthermore, it is shown that the impedance variation in the resulting realization is very close to the global minima for these ideal pulse compression networks with the additional desirable feature of a monotonic line realization."
"A class of weights is developed for minimizing the error in the approximation of a periodic function by a Fourier series with finitely many terms. The analysis is based on the following problem. Given a functionP(t), find the extrema of the integral\\int_{-T/2}^{T/2} P(t) | y(t) |^{2} dtasy(t)ranges over all normalized trigonometric polynomials of specified order."
"A transformation denoted by complementary transformation is developed, which maps a certain class of polynomials given in linear decomposition onto itself without changing the roots of the polynomials. This transformation applied on the characteristic equation of systems with one amplifier and one feedback network results in equivalent systems having the same relation between the eigenfrequencies and the network elements as the original systems."
"The impulse response of any finite lumped RC oneport that acts like a capacitor as frequency tends to infinity is completely monotonic. This property can be used to define a more general type of one-port, which we call \"relaxive\" one-ports. Their behavior is typical for various infinite and distributed RC networks. Characteristic representations for such one-ports in both the time and frequency domains are given, and a number of properties are established."
"The realization of nonoriented communication nets satisfying requirements of two commodities is investigated in this paper. A necessary condition for a requirement matrix to be a terminal capacity matrix of a communication net is found. A method of synthesizing a2n-terminal net with the use of a special configuration is presented. The results based on graph theory are more convenient than those of linear programming. Whenever a realization is obtained, it is an optimum realization. The procedures which convert a2n-terminal net into a2(n+ 1)-terminal net are also discussed."
"The problem of determining the poles and zeros of a linear system is considered. Also pointed out is that this problem is mathematically equivalent to the generalized eigenvalue problem of the form\\lambda Ax =Bx, which may be solved by means of some wellestablished numerical techniques. Two practical and reliable algorithms are presented. The first algorithm is more general than the second and can be effectively used to obtain the poles and zeros of a linear system even without knowing its state-space representation. The second algorithm assumes that the state-space equations of the system are known and takes full advantage of their special form. Both algorithms also offer considerable savings in computational effort when applied to multiple-input multiple-output systems. Several examples which illustrate the proposed methods and their computational characteristics are included."
"This Special Issue is devoted to the study of large-scale networks. Its object is to encourage circuit theorists towards a more active participation in the solution of large-scale network problems. The range of papers in this issue indicates the breadth of the field. Large-scale networks are regularly encountered in such diverse areas as circuit theory, communications, computer networks, pipelines, transportation, scheduling and distribution, and power. The range of techniques needed to deal with these networks includes combinatorics and graph theory, network topology, mathematical programming, queuing theory, probability theory and statistics, and heuristic programming. Large-scale network theory represents a challenging new research area for theory and application. The readers of this issue are invited to join."
 "The government procures long-distance circuits from communication carriers under a bulk-rate tariff referred to as Telpaks. While physical implementation of circuits is performed by the carriers, the arrangement of circuits into Telpaks for billing purposes is the government's responsibility. Since Telpaks were established in 1961, the government has arranged its circuits into Telpaks on a manual basis. As a result, it has never been able to achieve a minimum cost grouping for over 60 000 circuits among more than 3000 service points. Further, the problem of minimizing the cost of Telpaks has defied classical mathematical approaches because of the large number of service points and circuits. By applying heuristic design techniques, the systematic procedure which is described in this paper has been developed for automating the design of the government Telpak network. Its use has resulted in substantial cost savings over the manually obtained configuration."
"A large-scale dynamical system is given in a block-diagram form. The block diagram is assumed to be composed of blocks (subsystems), each characterized by a state equation and an output equation in the normal form\\dot{x} =f(x, u, t), y = g(x, u, t). Investigations are made on the effect of subsystem characteristics and their interconnections upon properties of the entire system. The first half is concerned with representation of the entire system. Sufficient conditions are given for the entire system to have a representation in the normal form with the state space composed of the direct product of subsystem state spaces. In a linear system these conditions are also necessary. An additional condition is given under which the entire system further satisfies a global Lipschitz condition when each subsystem is also globally Lipschitzian. The second half is concerned with the small-signal behavior of the entire system and a theorem is given which states that if the large linear system resulting from linearization of each subsystem (linearized about a solution of the original nonlinear system) has a state equation, then the large nonlinear system has a normal form in the neighborhood of the solution such that the linearized equation of the normal form is identical with the state equation of the large linear system."
"Given the set of all simple paths between two nodes in a network, the terminal reliability can be symbolically computed by transforming a Boolean sum of products into an equivalent form in which all terms are disjoint. This new approach seems to be promising in respect to existing 4[ 6 methods both for the exact and for the approximate computation of the terminal reliability."
"The theory of tearing, also known as diakoptics, is applied to the problem of economy-security control of generation in power pools and in superpools. Power pools consist of individual utilities that join together to produce an optimal allocation of generation subject to the security constraints on the system. There are at present a number of power pools in the United States. Superpools consist of a multiplicity of power pools. Multiarea and multipool procedures are presented for the real-time control of generation in pools and in superpools using the hierarchy of computers present in the operations of individual utility companies. Other applications of diakoptics to power systems are summarized."
"Power system transmission planning is expressed as a large finite Markovian sequential process over time involving 1) a known planning horizon divided into finite number of stages; 2) a large number of alternative additions (type, size, and place of new facilities) at each stage; 3) analysis and criteria for evaluating network acceptance (performance, reliability, security, cost, etc.) for each alternative at each stage; 4) a searching method to find the optimum plan. Forward dynamic programming is used to maximize the utility of the transmission network over the period of the planning horizon ensuing adequate service, and the results show the effects of economy of scale as the planning horizon is increased. However, dynamic programming is limited by the number of alternatives considered at each stage. Thus a new method, discrete dynamic optimizing (DDO), is also introduced."
"Linear time-invariant large-scale dynamical systems (LSDS's) are considered. A component-connection model is first proposed. Conditions under which an LSDS has a state equation representation are determined. A characterization of a class of dynamical systems, called unimodules, is established. A unimodule has the property that any given dynamical system can be realized by an interconnection of such unimodules."
"A class of active RC networks is presented with which an all-pass transfer function of arbitrary order, having simple negative real poles, has been realized by combining the output of a threeterminal RC network with a portion of its input in a differential amplifier. A synthesis procedure for such an all-pass function is also indicated. This class of networks has the advantage that the gain constant of the all-pass function may be varied by varying the gain of the differential amplifier."
 "The angle property of positive real (rational) functionsZ(s), namely, that|\\arg s | \\geqq |\\arg Z(s)|in the right half of thes-plane, can be demonstrated very simply by an examination of the imaginary parts of the functions\\ln(s/Z(s))and\\ln (sZ(s)), i.e.,\\arg s \\mp \\arg Z(s). In particular, on a contour enclosing the entire first quadrant,\\arg s \\mp \\arg Z(s)can rather easily be shown to be nonnegative. The extremum theorem of analytic functions then assures that\\arg s \\mp \\arg Z(s)cannot be negative inside the first quadrant; thus the angle property is demonstrated in the first quadrant. The same result is obtained immediately in the fourth quadrant."
"The maximum power transfer theorem is proved by an elementary and simple method. The class of all impedance matrices which achieve maximum power transfer is completely described. Cases whereZ_{0}+Z_{0^\\ast}is not positive definite are completely discussed."
 "A new biquadratic active filter configuration is described which requires only two resistors, two capacitors, and two finite gain summing amplifiers. The circuit is shown to have zeroQ-sensitivity to the resistors and capacitors and extremely lowQ- sensitivity to the amplifiers.Other sensitivities of interest are also shown to be low. Practical realizations using one operational amplifier and additional resistors for each summing amplifier are given for bandpass, low-pass, high-pass, and notch filtering."
"The realization of electronically tunable RC-active filters is achieved by the use of periodically switched conductances within the filter. A method of analysis of RC networks containing periodically switched conductances is given, which is based on the impulse response of the network at a capacitance. The use of periodically switched conductances to tune RC-active filters has several practical advantages, such as eliminating the need to carefully match independently adjustable network elements and being able to control a transfer function with one timing waveform. This method of electronically tuning RC-active filters is illustrated by several designs."
"A technique of synthesizing a resistiven-port is described. The port structure is first determined using some necessary conditions. Branch conductances are obtained by solving a system of equations on a computer."
"A new computation method is given connected with the analysis of equivalent circuits including uncorrelated as well as correlated noise sources, thus saving computer time."
"A method of designing digital fiters to directly equalize log gain functions of frequency is presented. Two methods of estimating the error are also given."
"A new system matrix that can realize any second-order digital filter is presented. This matrix exhibits minimum eigenvalue sensitivity when compared to other second-order matrices over certain regions of root locations within the unit circle."
"The time-domain analysis and realization of cascaded, uniform, lossless transmission-line networks are considered. A Hessenberg matrixLis defined in terms of which the reflected impulse response and the transmitted impulse response are expressed in closed form. A realization scheme is presented for determining a network whose reflected impulse response is a specified sequence of impulses."
"A new synthesis technique has been evolved and a definite realization procedure has been given for a general class of transformerlessn-terminal RC networks. For the applicability of this technique, necessary and sufficient conditions have been stated and the relevant theorems proved. The technique utilizes the method of parallel decomposition and application of successive generalized star-mesh transformation. With this technique it is possible to realize a general class of nth-order indefinite admittance matrices by networks of series-parallel class in the form of grounded structures. To illustrate the synthesis procedure, a few examples of network realization have been given."
"Assuming that a driving-point impedanceF(s)=N(s)/D(s)is known by the coefficients of the rational function, both polynomials of the same degree and normalized, theA-type (resistance series) and/or theB-type (resistance parallel) Brune circuit can rapidly and with high accuracy be designed using the results of evaluatingN(j\\omega)andD(j\\omega)only. In a few steps the circuit can be transformed into the Bott-Duffin circuit. The suggested procedure becomes especially advantageous whenF(s)is a function of high rank."
"Formulas are easily derived for computing the sensitivity of all the response variables of a network with respect to variation of a single parameter, and the computations can be carried out very efficiently. The converse problem of computing the sensitivity of a single response variable with respect to variations of several parameters, though apparently more difficult, has recently been solved with equal efficiency by appealing to the concept of an \"adjoint network.\" This concept, however, is shown here to be superfluous, since equivalent (and slightly simpler) formulas can be derived using well-known matrix manipulations alone. The problem of computing the signal/noise ratio of a single network response variable has also been solved by using the adjoint network, concept. But, here again, standard matrix manipulations suffice to yield the same results with less conceptual encumbrance. Thus the adjoint network approach, though still valid, proves to be unnecessary for solving these two problems."
"The converse problems of the network solution matrices are considered. The solutions found bear a remarkable similarity to the original solution matrices. The stepwise solution and its converse used alternately provide a useful procedure for conversational-mode analysis of circuits. Use is also made of the results to give a direct method in deriving the partial derivatives of the solution matrices of all orders needed in the sensitivity studies with respect to the appropriate branch elements."
"This paper is concerned with eigenvalue approaches for the pole-zero calculations of the transfer function of a linear timeinvariant network. Combinatorial and sparse-matrix algorithms are fully used to increase numerical accuracy and computational speed in the two-sets-of-eigenvalues approach. Some matrix decompositionreduction algorithms are presented to simplify and stabilize the numerical eigenvalue-finding procedures."
"Given the zeros of the even or the odd parts of Hurwitz polynomials (HP), conditions have been established such that their integrals are suitable as the odd or the even parts of other HP's. Testing procedures, including simple inspection tests, have been enunciated for both cases. The criteria developed can be used to generate positive real functions (prf) of higher order."
"Given a large but finite tree network designed to distribute a commodity to some or all of its nodes, the lossy model takes into account the attenuation of the flow through the branches of the network. The capacity of the source needed to feed the network depends on the node to which it is attached. In a finite network, there must be at least one node where the required source capacity is not higher than that at any other node. This short paper proves that there can be only one such node or, at most, two adjacent nodes with the same value for the required source capacity. Regarding the required source capacity as a function over the set of nodes, it is shown that this function can have only one local minimum (a node where the value is not higher than at any adjacent node), and no local maximum. Based on these properties, search algorithms are outlined to locate the node with the optimal source capacity."
"A multinet wiring problem is proposed. This problem has application in the routing of interconnection wires on integrated circuit chips and printed circuit boards. Optimal and suboptimal algorithms, based on the branch-and-bound method, are described for its solution."
"The cable-communications systems,m-center, and minimum spanning-tree problems are contained within a general graph optimization-synthesis problem. In the minimum spanningtree problem, a decomposition technique is used in constructing minimal-length trees. This problem is related to them-center problem where the total number of vertices is estimated from the length of the spanning tree. Both results, vertex estimate and decomposition, are utilized in the cable-communications systems problem. A procedure and example are provided for estimating the dollar cost of a cable-communications system."
"A new method for diakoptics, the piecewise method for large-scale networks, is presented. While the subject of diakoptics is well known, it treats only networks described by either impedance or admittance matrix. Using the sparse-matrix approach, the new method treats networks whose constitutive relationships are not restricted to impedances or admittances. Finally, the previously known techniques for diakoptics are merely special cases of the method described here, thus this short paper provides a broad view on this subject."
"It is shown that the realizability conditions of Erdös and Gallai for a sequence of nonnegative integers to be the degrees of a graph having no parallel edges and self-loops can be deduced from those for a directed graph."
"The need for improved ocean shipping service in the South Pacific, as evidenced by recent statements from indigenous political and business leaders and organizations, is cited. The major hypothesis of the research is then presented: \"There exists a potential for improvement in shipping service and a reduction in cost-of-service through: a) consolidation and/or expansion of existing routes into regional center-feeder line networks; b) consolidation of capital equipment or merger of existing firms.\" A possible approach using minimal spanning trees (MST's) is illustrated for selected South Pacific ports. The results are intended to illustrate and establish the methodology. The short paper concludes with a brief description of the research work that remains to be done before the hypothesis can be accurately tested."
"It is shown that a certain class of linear systems with constant parameters and periodically operated switches can be approximated by a linear time-invariant system provided that the switching frequency is much greater than the magnitude of the largest natural frequency of the linear time-invariant system. Furthermore, a special type of switching allows the linear time-invariant system to be frequency scaled by simply varying the average value of the switching function. This feature allows one to design electronically tunable filters."
"Upper bounds, some of which are shown to be least upper bounds, are established on the number of output stations, and, hence, the number of output terminals in multistage networks realizing full fanout connection assignments. Networks meeting these conditions are shown to be either rearrangeable or nonblocking and to have less switches than the product of the input and output terminals for a sufficiently large number of such terminals."
"The problem of interconnecting several identical filters so as to obtain a filter which is both nominally closer to ideal and has lower sensitivity than the original filter is studied. A feedforward design for such a redundant filter is given which is applicable to filters having any specified passband, and the results of simulations illustrating the improvement in nominal behavior and sensitivity resulting from redundancy are presented."
"The design and realization of filters in communication systems have been influenced by various technologies over the past years. Beyond the traditional LC-filter technology, a sophisticated crystal-filter and, more recently, a mechanical-filter technology have been developed. Each filter technology is applied in multiplex communication systems according to its inherent technical and economical advantages. With the economical acceptability of integrated circuits, two more filter technologies begin to compete with the established filter concepts. Active filters in thin-film realization show promising aspects for certain applications and for mass production. Digital-filter techniques seem to be, understood well enough that it is worth looking for their application in multiplex systems. The various filter techniques, new and old, are set into the perspective of their economical use in multiplex communication systems."
"An analysis is presented for obtaining a general transfer function for a digital filter, with a number of shift sequences in each pulse-repetition interval, as initially described by Fjällbrant. This type of filter has been given the term \"multirate filter.\" The analysis results in a complex convolution integral which is evaluated to produce the transfer function resulting from the multirate processing. Some examples of the use of this technique in certain quantization problems are given."
 "The responseg(t)of a linear system is approximated by the sumc_{1}f(t - t_{1}) +\\cdots + c_{n}f(t - t_{n})involving delays of the inputf(t). The constantsc_iandt_iare determined in terms of the moments of the impulse responseh(t). The resulting frequency fit equals2n."
  "In attempting to predict the behavior of a filter during and at the end of its life, one is led to the study of sensitivity and then one must compare worst-case and expected results. This paper shows that sensitivity can be expressed as a sum of terms, where each term is the product of two sensitivity functions. One is the frequency-dependent sensitivity of the gain to the transfer function coefficients (the gain-to-coefficient sensitivity) and the other is the well-known coefficient-to-component sensitivity. The gain-to-coefficient sensitivity clearly shows that the gain of a biquadratic function is far more sensitive to changes in the resonant frequencyf_0than to changes inQonly near the 3-dB frequencies. The gain is actually less sensitive to changes inf_0nearf_0. It is also shown that coefficient-to-component sensitivities for resistors and capacitors have no effect on the mean value of the change in the gain, but have marked effects on the standard deviation."
"An open-circuit voltage transfer-function synthesis procedure is presented that realizes any arbitrary real rational function in the complex variable s. The procedure makes use of an active device referred to as the generalized positive impedance converter (GPIC). The synthesis procedure yields a network realization that 1) requires the minimum number of capacitors necessary for the synthesis, 2) is compatible with integrated-circuit fabrication techniques, and 3) has low sensitivity."
"The leapfrog ladder synthesis technique is shown to be topologically equivalent to gyrator-simulated inductance methods of simulating ladder filters. The topological equivalence employs nullors to show that the leapfrog structure is equivalent to embedding a grounded negative element between two matched negative immittance inverters. Low-pass and bandpass ladder networks may be obtained as interconnected biquads by inspection of the low-pass prototype LC ladder."
"The basic problem associated with the design of active filters is the sensitivity of filter characteristics to variations in filter component values. Utilization of a digital computer and the pole sensitivity concept provides a technique for filter design which incorporates sensitivity and filter turning as an integral step in the design procedure."
"A root locus with respect to the active parameter for any second-order active RC filter is circular with center on the real axis. It is shown that for any pole pairQand pole frequency\\omega_0, the circular root locus centered at-2Q \\omega_0on the real axis and of radius\\omega_{0}\\sqrt{4Q^{2}-1}exhibits zeroQ-sensitivity and zero gain-sensitivity product (GSP) with respect to the active parameter. Furthermore, realization techniques to achieve zeroQ-sensitivity and zero GSP for prescribedQand\\omega_0are outlined. Experimental results agree closely with the theoretical expectations."
"A modified Wien bridge circuit capable of realizing the second-order all-pass function with complex poles and zeros is presented. The effect of the limited frequency response of the amplifier is examined and a method for compensation is given along with a design example."
"The analysis of the linear multistep integration formulas is shown to be considerably simplified by associating to each formula a special function termed the canonical fraction. In particular, the canonical fraction approach provides a decoupling of the problem of stability from the problem of accuracy and allows the derivation of most of the properties ofA-stable and stiffly stable formulas as simple restatements of elementary electrical network theorems. Results obtained tend to show that linear multistep formulas, which are much more efficient than the ones commonly used today, exist."
"A convergent gradient descent technique is provided for the approximation of functions of time from their Laplace transforms. The approximation is composed of a finite series of exponential functions. Both the complex coefficients and exponents of the exponential terms are adjusted to reduce the integral squared error at each iteration. The novel feature of the present method is that all parameters are adjusted through the use of explicit formulas. This overcomes the usual numerical difficulties associated with the inversion of ill-conditioned matrices. Finally, the utility of the proposed method is demonstrated by its performance on certain examples chosen to allow comparison with previously developed methods."
"Topological formulas are obtained for networks containing voltage-dependent current sources, current-dependent voltage sources, voltage-dependent voltage sources, and current-dependent current sources. The formulas are expressed entirely in terms of trees of a single simply obtained graph. Each tree is multiplied by the appropriate product of transmittances, and the sign associated with a term is given. A simple example is provided."
"Analysis and an algorithm are providedfor the linear minimax approximation of system functions when equality constraints are imposed upon the approximant and/or the basis functions do not form a Chebyshev set in the region of approximation. The latter situation is restricted to the case of common zeros shared by all basis functions. The theory and algorithm are especially useful in the approximation of arbitrary system functions by functions with restricted Fourier transforms."
"A linear synthesis technique is developed for a recursive digital filter which approximates the desired discrete impulse response. Sequential schemes which can be used to refine the preliminary filter design are developed for three distinct cases in which the output sequence number, the filter order, and the number of the numerator coefficients of the transfer function are allowed to vary separately. By use of matrix inversion lemmas, the new sets of filter coefficients are obtained sequentially based on the old estimates and the new data without having to repeat the entire design procedure."
"Some of the properties of optimal solutions to the finite-impulse-response low-pass filter design problem are discussed. These solutions are optimum in the sense of discrete Chebyshev approximation over a union of closed compact sets, i.e., the error of approximation exhibits at least(N + 3)/2alternations (of equal amplitude) over the frequency ranges of interest, whereNis the duration of the filter impulse response in samples. It has been shown that, in certain special cases, the solution can exhibit(N + 5)/2alternations of equal amplitude. These solutions have been called extraripple filters because of the extra alternation that is present. How these extraripple solutions can, within bounds, be scaled to yield additional solutions, which are still optimal over new frequency ranges, is shown.' Thus an infinite number of optimal low-pass filters may be obtained directly from a finite number of extraripple solutions. An interpretation of the various types of optimal filters, in terms of locations of the zeros of thez- transform polynomial, is also given."
"Spectral theory of operators is used to determine a general procedure for determining bounds on the difference between the states and outputs of a finite precision fixed-point digital filter and its infinite precision ideal counterpart. The results bound quantization errors for transients as well as limit cycles and apply when input signals are present. The procedure is extended to digital filters associated with difference equations, including the important special case of the basic second-order section."
"In a linear resistive network, a maximal set, called a basis, of variables that are linearly independent with respect to coefficients that are rational functions in edge admittances is determined. It is shown that the basis is an important concept in linear network analysis in the sense that any network equation can uniquely and minimally be expressible in terms of the elements in a basis. In order to characterize the algebraic structure of the variables in connection with the basis, existence theorems on mappings from given variables to all the source currents and voltages are presented."
"A new analysis approach to understand and minimize nonlinear distortion in bipolar transistors is presented. It employs a recently developed nonlinear device model, known as the integral charge control model, and a powerful analysis tool: the Volterra series representation. The salient analytical features of this paper are: a simple representation of the Volterra transfer functions of the transistor, compact expressions for frequency-dependent distortion coefficients, and physically meaningful asymptotic low- and high-frequency distortion coefficients. The analytical results have been experimentally verified. Finally, specific design examples are furnished to illustrate the powerful nature of the above analytical expressions."
"A method for writing state equations for an improper network without having to invert matrices is presented. The method employs substitution theorem as well as superposition principle."
"Group theoretical concepts are applied to the analysis of linear systems having arbitrary structural symmetries. These concepts make possible the identification of the smallest subsystem that supports a set of symmetry basis solutions, thereby simplifying to a large extent the computations involved in finding the system equations. An application of the proposed method to electrical network analysis is shown as an example."
"A technique is given for approximating the \"most likely\" values of the internal components of a system when insufficient measurements have made their exact determination impossible. It is limited to linear systems, all of whose measurements are made at a single frequency and whose connections can be represented by sets of linear algebraic equations. The technique is based on the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of a linear approximation of the system function and is formulated in terms of the component-connection model of a largescale dynamical system."
"A simple method is presented for determining sums of products of subquotients from a continued fraction expansion for use in connection with Euclid's algorithm."
"A numerical method is developed for determining a sequenceh[k]in terms of the valuesH(z_n)of itsz-transformH(z)at a set of pointsz_nalong the realz-axis. In the analysis, a new class of orthogonal sequences is introduced."
 "The foundational aspects of an important subclass of timeinvariant nonlinearn-ports are dealt with; namely, the class of algebraicn-ports that includes, among other things, resistors, inductors, capacitors, and memristors as special cases. Sufficient conditions that guarantee an algebraicn-port to admit all2^nhybrid representations are given. Both global and local characterizations are considered in detail. In particular, certain global properties are shown to be invariants relative to the various modes of hybrid representation. The concept of reciprocity is explored in depth and shown to play an important role in determining such global properties as losslessness and passivity. Several generalized potential functions are defined for reciprocal algebraicn-ports. These functions are then used to derive a number of interesting circuit theoretic properties for nonlinearn-ports."
"The various transformations involved in transforming the polynomialF(z) = \\Sigma_{k=0}^{n}a_{k}z^{k}into the polynomialG(s) = \\Sigma_{k=0}^{n} b_{k}s^{k}are discussed. In particular, the entries of theQ-matrix of the matrix transformationb] = Qa]are generated in easily obtained combinatorial rules. The various applications of the transformations in the stability study of discrete systems in aperiodicity conditions in evaluation of total square integrals and in digital-filter design are enumerated."
"Equations are derived which enable the designer to predict, from a single circuit analysis, all sensitivities and the worst case error of the loss response for a doubly terminated reactance two-port. The method is extended to the important practical class of resonanceadjusted circuits. The results confirm the experimentally observed dependence of the sensitivities on the reflection factor and on the tuning process used in the construction of the circuit. Interestingly, the sensitivities depend only on the properties of the reflection coefficients and on the complex power in the individual reactive elements."
"A new performance criterion for comparing high-pass filters (HPF's) is proposed; namely,E, the unit-step-response energy. Increased interest in narrow-bandwidth notch filters with minimum energy of the envelope response to the center frequency amplitudemodulated by a step function prompted this choice, for this envelope energy is proportional toEof the equivalent HPF. Initially, it is shown thatEis identical to the prototype low-pass filter (LPF) impulse-response energy, thus relating the transient characteristics of the two filters. It is further shown that the so-called \"unknown energy\" referred to in the literature is actuallyE. A new expression is derived for the step-response energy of a lossless passive singly terminated network, whose input impedance is minimum reactance. This formula simplifies for HPF's so thatEis easily computed and then plotted for well-known responses. The noise bandwidth of an LPF is shown to be proportional toE; thus the curves forEalso yield the noise bandwidths. This consolidates much of the scattered information on this subject. It is then established that of all second-order systems, the Chebyshev filters possess the lowest value ofE; in fact, the energy decreases as the passband ripple increases."
"A set of rational functions based on ultraspherical polynomials is developed and used to approximate the ideal amplitude response of a low-pass filter, including by conjecture the elliptic filter as a special case. The procedure described for obtaining the elliptic filter avoids the necessity of computing the modulus of the elliptic functions, and requires no knowledge of elliptic function theory."
"The polynomial solutions of the equationfy\" + gy' + {\\lambda}y = 0are obtained and classified forf, g, and\\lambda-certain second-degree, firstdegree, and zero-degree polynomials, respectively. The classes of solutions are shown to include important sets of polynomials used in constructing amplitude functions, transfer functions, and driving-point functions used in circuit theory."
"In [1], a very neat set of necessary and sufficient conditions for 1-pole admittance functions realizable as anRC3-terminal network has been given. Reference [2] deals with a more general class of admittance functions which includes a limited class of 2-pole admittance functions. A new class of 2-pole admittance functions which are realizable as series-parallelRC3-terminal networks is pointed out."
"A direct design procedure is described that avoids the iterative gradient search required in Peikari's procedure, provided the problem is consistently set. The fulln-dimensional vector case is treated."
 "A modified Routh algorithm is used to obtain the element values of lossy ladder networks. These values are shown to be identical to those obtained in terms of the Taylor series expansion of the input impedance [1]."
    "Recursive and explicit formulas are given for the time response connected with the complex multiple poles of a frequencydomain transfer function. The formulas may be used to obtain higher order Laplace-transform pairs and to simplify computer calculations of such time responses."
"A method for calculating the noise voltage at the output of quadratic filter sections is developed. Multiple-feedback low-pass, bandpass, and high-pass quadratic filter sections realized using differential-input single-ended output operational amplifiers are analyzed. The amplifiers are assumed to have infinite input impedance, infinite gain, and zero output impedance. The noise sources associated with the amplifiers are assumed to be statistically independent, but can have both white andl/fnoise components. A noise analysis of a fourthorder maximally flat low-pass filter realized by cascading two quadratic filter sections is included."
"By assuming a typical range of amplifier specifications, a model is derived for a capacitively terminated operational-amplifier Rgyrator circuit. Amplifier imperfections such as finite input and output resistances and also finite frequency-dependent amplifications are taken into account. The validity of the model is confirmed by using an exact computer-aided analysis and also by experiment. The model clearly shows the influence of each amplifier imperfection on the performance of the gyrator circuit, and it should prove useful to the network designer."
"Active filters are frequently realized as grounded threeterminal networks. It will be shown that one can create the complementary transfer functiont' = 1 - tby first synthesizingtwith a threeterminal network and then interchanging the network's input and ground leads, i.e., the former network ground is the new input and the former input is grounded. The output voltage continues to be taken with respect to common ground. If the active element in the network is a differential-input op amp, then this maneuver can be carried out without changing the dc power-supply common-ground connection. It is shown that this is not true in general of finite-gain amplifier networks or of single-input op amp networks. Several uses are suggested and the example of a 360° all-pass section is examined in detail. It is shown that in the particular case of a multiinput biquad all-pass section there is a small increase in the variability of the delay due to resistor changes, and experimental results are given which confirm this. Both the all-pass and band-reject realizations are attractive because the zero frequency is guaranteed to track the pole frequency. A proof of the results for anN-terminal network is outlined."
"An approach to active filter design is presented, which allows for the adjustment of circuit complexity according to technical requirements. Higher circuit complexity may be required in order to take care of parasitics introduced by element models at high frequencies. The method is based on state-space equivalence transformations."
"A method for the synthesis of general active RC all-pass sections is presented which places no restrictions on the realizable pole locations. The circuit uses a differential amplifier of very low gain and can be built with lumped or lumped-and-distributed elements."
"A synthesis of real-rational transfer functions is presented which uses only resistors and transistors as construction components. The method proceeds by incorporating transistor dynamics into a statevariable formulation and, as such, generalizes the ideas of Capparelli and Liberatore."
"SCALP is a digital computer program to analyze linear timeinvariant networks in the frequency domain. Among the options available are symbolic analysis, the calculation of frequency response, poles, and zeros, and the generation of sensitivity information. The versatility of SCALP is a unique feature not available in many currentanalysis programs."
"Algorithms are presented for the assignment of tolerances to the elements of linear circuits for both the continuous and discrete case. These algorithms employ a variable sample size Monte Carlo analysis in the main iteration loop to insure the validity of the results. Possible correlation between element values is taken into account. The algorithms are capable of handling situations in which less than a 100- percent yield is desired."
"The transient analysis of nonuniform transmission lines is a task that has to be done frequently in varied fields of engineering. Since the analytical solutions exist only in a few cases, numerical algorithms become inevitable. This short paper describes a new and simple method of the transient response calculation of nonuniform transmission lines. The new approach uses the electrical distance as an independent variable, and makes it possible to apply the method of characteristics as easily as in the case of uniform lines. The technique is thus more practical than those previously described."
"A direct approximation method is given for periodic frequency-domain characteristics, such as magnitude and delay, leading to digital-filter functions. Dependence on lumped-element designs or on optimization methods is therefore not necessary. The approximation method is simple, with predictable error. For recursive filter functions it can be shown that stability is achieved."
"The wave digital filter patterned after doubly terminated maximum available power (MAP) networks by means of the Richard's transformation has been shown to have low-coefficient-sensitivity properties. This paper examines the exact nature of the relationship between the wave-digital-filter structure and the MAP networks and how the sensitivity property arises, which permits implementation of the digital structure with a lower coefficient word length than that possible with the conventional structures. The proper design procedure is specified and the nature of the unique complementary outputs is discussed. Finally, an example is considered which illustrates the wave filter design, the conversion techniques, and the low sensitivity properties."
"Saito's realizability conditions on the networks composed ofn-cascaded noncommensurable transmission lines, closed on a resistance, are considered. The condition about real positivity of the input admittance is investigated; it is shown that it is partially redundant and can be substituted by a new condition, which verifies the positivity of onlyn + 1coefficients of the admittance function."
"The Hurwitz stability test is extended to lumped-distributed RC networks. These networks have the property that, if they are unstable, their singularities in the right half-plane are confined to within a finite radius."
"The use of transmission lines as circuit elements for designing frequency-shaping networks is described. Methods of realizing these circuits in a constant-resistance bridged-T form using coaxial or microstrip transmission lines are also described. The microstrip technique is particularly suitable for thin-film technology."
"Using the properties of polynomials orthogonal on the unit circle, an explicit solution is derived for the synthesis of resistively terminated one- or two-variable cascaded transmission-line networks. In the two-variable case, in addition to the cascade of ideal commensurate transmission lines, passive lossless lumped two-ports are allowed to exist between the junctions of adjacent lines. For this case, the explicit solution form enables the test for two-variable positive reality to be discarded in favor of a matrix factorization condition. In the onevariable case, due to the intimate relationship between the synthesis of a cascade of transmission lines and the generation of a sequence of polynomials orthogonal on the unit circle, Richards' theorem is not required for the explicit-form solution. Initially, the main theorem describing the explicit solution for the one- and two-variable cases is presented. After the formulation of the proofs, two nontrivial examples are cited to illustrate the use of the explicit-form solution in the two-variable case."
"A multivariable array is developed by means of which the realizability conditions for then-variable low-pass ladder network are obtained. By means of suitable transformations, other types ofn- variable ladder networks are derived. The following applications are discussed. 1) Then-variable ladder networks so obtained can be replaced by lumped reactive elements and noncommensurate short-circuited and open-circuited stubs. 2) An equivalence relation between the cascade of unit elements (UE's) separated by series lumped inductors on one side and shunt lumped capacitors on the other side and the two-variable low-pass ladder network (TLPL) is established."
"A method for symbolic analysis of linear time-invariant networks is described. The method is an extension of the work by Pottle [1] which is based on the Souriau-Frame algorithm for inverting the matrixsI-A. Our main concerns are the sources of numerical errors in the method and ways of overcoming them."
"An analysis method is presented for linear networks containing arbitrary linear, passive or active, and ideal or nonideal two-port elements (three-poles and four-poles) with existing chain matrices. It is suitable, especially in the analysis of networks containing two-ports with nonexisting admittince matrices like ideal transformers, proportionally controlled sources, and nullors. After the determination of the nodal admittance matrix of the subnetwork consisting only of two-pole elements, the remaining two-ports are inserted by simple row and column transformations in the matrix. The order of the matrix is reduced by the successive deletion of rows and columns corresponding to inner nodes of the network."
"Any well-behaved periodic waveform can be expressed as a series of Walsh functions. If the series is truncated at the end of any group of terms of a given order, the partial sum will be a stairstep approximation to the waveform. The height of each step will be the average value of the waveform over the same interval. If a zero-memory nonlinear transformation is applied to a Walsh series, the output series can be derived by simple algebraic processes. The coefficients of the input series will change, but there will be no new terms not in the original groups. Nonlinear differential and integral equations can be solved as a Walsh series, since the series for the derivatives can always be integrated by simple table lookup. The differential equation is solved for the highest derivative first and the result is then integrated the required number of times to give the solution."
"Esoteric algebraization has kept inaccessible to many engineers and scientists new insights of the past two decades, according to which the process of matrix inversion can be generalized to square singular and to rectangular matrices. The relevant algebraic manipulations are motivated and interpreted in terms of relations between geometric vectors inherent in the problem. At the same time some fundamental expressions and proofs are considerably simplified."
"Some basic concepts of transversal filters are reviewed. Transversal-filter structures provide a conceptually simple way for obtaining a wide range of transfer functions. However, the practical realization of such filters has, in the past, required very complex or bulky circuits because of the necessary delay line and because of the many taps and attenuators that may be needed. However, interdigital acoustic surface-wave transducers on piezoelectric substrates are seen to provide a very compact and attractive way to realize transversal filters. Acoustic waves in a solid have an extremely low velocity as compared with electromagnetic (EM) waves, so that the acoustic surface waves on the substrate provide a very compact delay line. Further, the desired set of weighted taps is readily achieved by a photoetched array of metallic fingers. Fringing electric fields from these fingers tap into the acoustic surface-wave delay line by way of the piezoelectric effect. Equivalent circuits for interdigital acoustic surface-wave transducers are discussed and equations for their transfer and input-impedance properties are presented. The application of interdigital transducers for use as conventional filters, pulse-compression filters, and general matched filters is briefly described."
"\"Topological formulas\" are established for the most general type of linear electrical networks in which the characteristics of branches are expressed in terms partly of impedances and partly of admittances. We shall call this type of topological formulas \"mixedtype topological formulas.\" Moreover, the networks under consideration may contain any type of mutual coupling such as active elements, controlled sources, ideal transformers, etc. The formulas are derived directly from the fundamental laws in network theory. Existing topological formulas are particular cases of those presented in this paper, and our way of derivation will be one of the most straightforward and can be applied to derive any known topological formula. Use is made only of the topological properties of original networks but not of auxiliary graphs such as voltage graphs, current graphs, and (signal-) flow graphs. The denominators and numerators of the formulas are expressed as the sum of the immittance products corresponding to the tree-cotree pairs of special kinds, and the sign of each term in the sum is characterized in topological terms."
"A graph-theoretic study of the computational efficiency of the generalized loop analysis and the generalized cutset analysis is presented. It is shown that the choice of an optimum mode of analysis will give rise to the sparsest loop impedance matrix and the sparsest cutset admittance matrix, respectively. The problem of formulating efficient algorithms for determining the optimum choice is shown to be strictly a problem in nonoriented linear graph. Two algorithms based on the concept of basis graph are presented and illustrated in detail with examples. A nonplanar version of the mesh analysis which generally yields a rather sparse loop impedance matrix is also included."
"A method is presented for the compensation of dissipationinduced loss distortion in the passband of doubly terminated low-pass reactance filters, The algorithm can also be used to design iteratively lossless two-ports with prescribed terminations."
 "The advanced statistical analysis program (ASTAP) is a general-purpose network-analysis program which performs nonlinear transient, dc, and ac analyses and provides statistical simulation to determine the distribution of circuit outputs due to parameter variations. The program combines a user-oriented input language capable of describing completely general nonlinear devices with the latest advances in numerical and programming techniques: variable-order implicit integration, tableau formulation, and sparse-matrix solution methods. This paper describes how these techniques have been implemented in the ASTAP program. Attention is focused on the computational algorithms."
"Comparative studies of computer-aided network analysis (CANA) program performance have been handicapped by a lack of statistics about networks. This paper derives bounds and presents empirical values for: 1) the number of elements per node; 2) the sparsity of the cutset matrix; 3) the density of nonlinear nodes; 4) the relative percentage of excess capacitors and inductors; and 5) the relationship between the number of elements of each element type and the total number of elements."
"In computer-aided design for large systems, the efficient solution of large sparse systems of linear equations is important. We critically examine two parts of the solution of sparse systems of linear equations: ordering and the factorization of the ordered matrix. After examining several candidates from a theoretical point of view, as well as with examples, we conclude that the Markowitz ordering criteria, with extension for the variability-type problem, is the most practical ordering algorithm. A combination of solution processes provides a very efficient hybrid algorithm for factoring the ordered sparse matrix. The hybrid is outlined so that it may be tailored to minimum storage utilization, minimum central processing unit (CPU) time, or may be built entirely in a high-level language to reduce programming time. A number of examples are included."
"Generalized MOS-device and circuit modeling problems are discussed. Guidelines for comparing MOS-device models, for selecting phenomena to be modeled, for acquiring model parameters, and for implementing the model are established. A voltage variable capacitance subroutine within a four-terminalQ_Bfield-dependent model is recommended. The importance of accurate data acquisition and model and parameter maintenance is stressed and computer implementation configurations are discussed."
"A simple analytical model is developed for the subthreshold region of insulated-gate field-effect transistors (IGFET). For short channels, it is necessary to extend the model to include two-dimensional band-bending effects at the source in order to describe correctly the reduction in threshold caused by high drain and substrate voltages. The model is experimentally verified over a wide range of bias conditions and channel lengths and is compared with one- and two-dimensional numerical models."
"The MOST model of Pao and Sah is extended to take into account the two-dimensional nature of the electrostatic potential. By keepig the current one dimensional, the basic equations can be cast into a form suitable for Gummel's iterative scheme. The numerical model is based on a finite-difference approximation to Poisson's equation and a closed-form expression for the current flow. The model is verified by comparing its results with experimental data. Good agreement is obtained. Deviations of the threshold voltage from the conventional expression for short-channel structures outside the range of the gradual channel approximation are investigated. In particular, the dependence of threshold voltage on channel length, drain-source, and substrate-source bias are illustrated with numerical and experimental results. Practical results from these investigations are summarized in graphical form."
"A transistor modeling program which is designed to operate in a minicomputer in real time has been developed for use in a manufacturing environment. The program resides in a PDP-15 associated with a computer-operated measurement set. The program is designed to aid in the manufacture and characterization of a particular type of high-frequency power transistor which is to be used in an amplifier where precise knowledge and control of frequency response is necessary. The program can produce in 15sa small-signal ac model of fixed topology which is sufficiently accurate so as to predict the amplifier gain to within 0.01 dB. Explicit analysis equations, the JacobsonOksman optimization algorithm, and certain problem formulation procedures were among techniques implemented in order to model with the necessary speed and accuracy. User experience is described."
"The recently developed algorithm of Golub for solving an overdetermined system of linear equations is applied to the least pth optimization of circuits and to the nodal and mesh analysis of passive resistive networks. The results show that Golub's technique is well suited for the solution of such problems, even in the presence of severe ill conditioning."
"This paper demonstrates how optimization methods that were originally derived for the design of networks comprised of ideal elements can profitably be used to realize practical designs of linear integrated-circuit amplifiers. Of fundamental importance is the establishment of a set of designable parameters which are consistent in terms of the relationship between the processing steps, i.e., the diffusion processes and mask geometries, used to fabricate a physical device and the parameters of the ideal elements used to model the device on the computer. These considerations have led to the computer program for fabrication-related optimization of linear integrated circuits (FROUC)."
"A method for designing finite-duration impulse-response (FIR) linear-phase digital filters is presented in which the four possible cases for such filters are treated in a unified approach. It is shown how to reduce each case to the proper form so that the Remez exchange algorithm can be used to compute the best approximation to the desired frequency response. The result is that a very flexible and fast technique is available for FIR linear-phase filter design."
"The design of transistorized distributed amplifiers (DA's) that takes into account line losses is considered. The design approach is based on the concept of interior matching and computer-aided optimization of responses. An actual design example is given."
"A method is described for the tolerance analysis of linear circuits with large element variations. It utilizes the adjoint network concept to set up a reduced system of equations, solvable by either Gaussian elimination or iteration. The process appears to be considerably more economical than simple repeated analysis of the circuit, provided that not all circuit elements are toleranced."
"In the design of long-haul analog communication systems, it is essential to understand the nonlinear distortion behavior of the electronic circuit realization. Distortion analysis of weakly nonlinear circuits has been developed based on the well-known perturbation method. In the frequency domain, the nonlinearities of a transistor are shown to be equivalently represented by intermodulation distortion sources whose amplitudes and phases are iteratively determined by the linear circuit characteristics and the Taylor-series coefficients associated with the nonlinearities. For all practical purposes, only two iterations are sufficient to yield accurate results. An algorithm for computing the second- and third-order intermodulation distortions is described. This algorithm has been implemented in a program called NODAP (nonlinear distortion analysis program). NODAP computes the smallsignal nonlinear transistor model from the recently developed integral change-control model (ICM). It then passes this information through a linear circuit analysis program for distortion computations. Computer results for several transistor circuits using Western Electric highfrequency transistors are all in excellent agreement with the measured data over a wide range of bias conditions and frequencies. This demonstrates the validity of the approach treated in the paper."
"Component placement and wire routing are looked at as a coupled surface layering problem on two planes. This problem is transformed into a graph theoretic synthesis problem by neglecting the lateral dimensions of components and wiring. A solution is given by programmable algorithms."
"A program for evaluation of parasitic capacitances of thinfilm conductors deposited on a dielectric substrate is described. The conductors can be of an arbitrary manhattan-type geometry and can be deposited on either side of the substrate. The dielectric substrate may have a metal backing. All the mutual and self-capacitances are computed. The method is inherently more accurate and faster than existing programs. The method involves subdivisions of the conductors into rectangles. A charge distribution with undefined parameters is assumed over each rectangle. The parameters of this distribution are forced to assume such values that the potential is constant across each conductor. The capacitances are computed from the resultant charges and potentials."
"A survey of applications of symbolic network functions is presented in which some network elements, in addition to the complex frequencys, are represented by variables. The concept of \"closed systems\" is generalized. A fundamental theorem on the form of symbolic network functions is proved."
"Symbolic analysis using direct matrix and interpolationformula methods are discussed. The techniques accommodate passive networks and active networks containing general frequency-dependent devices, themselves represented by rational-function matrices. Subsequently, this leads to the development of partitioned analysis. The suppression of numeric common factors and the determination of the order of complexity of the network are synonymous problems, and simple algorithmic solutions emerge. Simple rules for the choice of sample points leading to accurate analysis are given. Implementation yields a very fast computer-analysis method capable of accuracies comparable with other current techniques."
"A method of efficiently computing large-change sensitivities is described. The approach is more general than an existing method in that it is directly applicable to several network functions."
"A general-purpose electronic-circuit simulation program is employed to efficiently compute second- and third-order distortion due to weak nonlinearities in bipolar junction transistor (BJT) circuits of arbitrary complexity. The method is based on the Volterra-series representation of the electronic circuit and is valid at all frequencies. The transistors are represented by a simple modified Ebers-Moll model, and the adjoint-network concept is employed to efficiently compute the contribution of each nonlinearity in the circuit to the distortion at the output. The method is illustrated with a practical electronic-circuit example."
"The philosophy and features of the designer-oriented computer-aided design (CAD) are presented and discussed from both the economic and technical standpoint. Dedication of the CAD system is proposed for efficient design with the minicomputer being the economical choice. Some novel techniques suitable for minicomputers are proposed and a CAD system tailored for designer-oriented operation is described. Based on a 16 k minicomputer, the system generates for each design problem a custom program containing a set of simulated test instruments, thus reproducing the familiar laboratory environment for the designer. A sample problem is given."

"Quasi-optimum digital phase-locked loops (DPLL) are derived utilizing nonlinear estimation theory. Nonlinear approximations are employed to yield realizable loop structures. Baseband equivalent loop gains are derived, which, under high signal-to-noise ratio conditions may be calculated off line. Additional simplifications are made that permit the application of the Kalman filter algorithms to determine the minimum mean-square error (MSE) loop filter. Consideration is given to sampling rate and implementation requirements. Performance is evaluated by a theoretical analysis and by simulation. Theoretical and simulated results are discussed and a comparison to analog results is made."
"The reception and detection of a single digit under known channel conditions are investigated. The probability of error for an optimum one-shot receiver instantaneously matched to the channel state is averaged over an ensemble of dispersive diversity channels. The average probability of error as a function of energy to noise ratio is found to be solely dependent on the ratio of rms dispersion width to data symbol width. For these dispersive channels an implicit diversity effect is qualitatively explained in terms of eigenvalues that depend on the ensemble statistic. The one-shot receiver performance provides a bound for practical receivers. In a comparison with a decision feedback equalizer, it is shown that on moderately dispersive channels the equalizer nearly achieves optimum one-shot performance. Since an adaptive version of this equalizer exists, this means data transmission on slowly fading channels is possible at rates above the natural rate suggested by the channel dispersion spread without bandwidth expansion and with small intersymbol interference penalty. The use of one-shot receiver performance curves can also be used as estimates of equalizer performance in situations where computation of the latter is impractical."
"Since the introduction of large-scale integration (LSI) techniques, there has been a continuing effort to develop digitalization techniques for communication equipment amenable to LSI implementation. Hopefully, this will permit expanded capability in the equipment while taking advantage of the cost reliability attributed of LSI. In this paper, a digitalized or sampled-data FM demodulator recursive algorithm is synthesized and its signal-to-noise ratio performance compared with the optimum analog demodulator and the conventional limiter discriminator demodulator. The demodulator is shown to exhibit threshold extension capability and automatic time-varying gain (bandwidth) adjustments from acquisition through tracking of the incoming modulated signal."
"Pseudorandom dot scan yields a visually tolerable smallarea flicker for low frame rate television as compared to the large-area flicker of a conventional scanning sequence. With a short-persistence phosphor, one can use 12 frames/s. With a long persistence (such as a P38), one can display 3 frames/s. The \"drift illusion factors\" of various scanning systems are calculated. Ifnsquare-wave generators are used to cover a rectangle,n!different scanning sequences are possible; this is applied to the scrambling of pictures. Hybrid systems, which avoid some of the disadvantages of a square-wave scan, are described. The results of an audience-reaction experiment in determining effective resolution are given."
"This paper examines the followingM-level pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) sequential communication system. Given that one of theMsignals is repetitively sent over an additive Gaussian channel during successive intervals of time, what is the optimum sequential procedure to follow at the receiver in order to pick the correct signal with a probability of wrong selection no greater than\\epsilon?The optimum procedure is defined to be one that minimizes the expected number of transmissions (sample size) before a decision is reached. The paper extends the results of Hecht for the \"simultaneous\" test procedure (also obtained independently by the author). This paper shows the following. 1) The maximum a posteriori (MAP) test procedure is shown to be comparable in performance with the simultaneous test. 2) MAP test with a threshold 1 - ε does not yield error probabilities equal to ε ifM \\geq 3. 3) Lower bounds on the expected sample sizes for any test procedure for theM-level PAM are obtained with the results from Hoeffding and Simons. 4) Both the simultaneous and the MAP tests are shown to achieve the lower bound when\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0. 5) Approximations used by Hecht for the simultaneous test are made rigorous and slightly tighter expressions of error probability than the ones given by Hecht are obtained for some cases. 6) Energy savings of both the MAP and the simultaneous tests over the nonsequential scheme are presented for different values ofM."
"This paper describes a study of a mathematical model of the impact of an equipment irregularity on trouble detection and the quality of customer service in a telephone network. The essence of the model is that the holding time of any piece of equipment may be altered if it develops a fault. Customer service is shown to be less sensitive to increases in holding time than decreases. Trunk and some types of other irregularities, characterized by holding times shorter than usual, are seen to affect service more severely than certain common control equipment irregularities, characterized by longer than usual holding times. Analytical and numerical techniques for studying the model are described. Results are presented for the various classes of equipment irregularities. The predicted effects are especially important in the area of recognizing and locating network faults and agree with practical experience."
"In Part I of this paper an analytical methodology for quantitatively evaluating radio-communication nets was introduced and the details of the model and mathematics were explained. In this part of the paper the application of the methodology is quantitatively discussed. Results for particular net situations are presented. They are performance of single nets with multiple frequencies, nets with mutual signaling interference resulting from asynchronous signaling and a comparison of dedicated nets with a multiple access-discrete address system. The frequency spectrum savings for the latter use is also considered."
 "In voice radio communication nets, digital-frequency assignment patterns and multiple-access discrete address transceivers are being studied to improve grade of service, mean access delay, and other aspects of system performance. An analytical methodology based on a calling system-outer system queueing model is presented. This model permits study of these radio communication problems and system design tradeoffs without computer simulation. In addition, the model utilizes several types of statistics (e.g., Poisson, Erlangian, or hyperexponential). In this paper, the model and the mathematical methodology are explained in detail. Formulas for equilibrium performance measures are derived from their definitions. The concept of station-busy probabilities is introduced and a matrix technique for obtaining numerical results is illustrated."
"A new touch actuator is described that consists of a single metalized foil electret, a number of independent metal backplate sections aligned with the holes of a front cover, and air gaps separating electret and backplate sections. The metal layer of the foil forms a transducer with capacitance Cawith each backplate section. The actuator is operated by touching the foil electret through one of the front-cover holes. For a trapezoidal displacement (duration2T) of the foil electret, the electrical output signal across a terminating resistorRconsists of a pair of oppositely poled spikes with duration comparable to RCa, if RCais smaller thanT. If RCais larger thanT, the electrical output approximates the displacement. For an electret with a charge density of10^{-8} C/cm^{2}, the measured pulse amplitudes due to touching are of the order of 0.3 to over 100 V depending on the applied force, and on the resistive and capacitive loading. The touch actuator is mechanically simple, reliable to use, inexpensive to produce, and can be made with an overall thickness of less than 0.5 cm. Apart from its potential use in telephone dials, it may also find applications as a key transducer in digital devices."
"When an angle-modulated signal plus noise constitute the input to a bandpass device exhibiting a nonlinear input-output power characteristic and AM to PM conversion, the noise component of the output has altered first- and second-order statistics. A method of evaluating the two-dimensional first-order statistics of this noise is presented. The effect on signal detectability of a nonlinearity inserted between two channel noise sources is studied; expressions for the mean square received phase error and probability of error (for coherent digital phase modulation) are derived. The hard limiting satellite channel, with Gaussian noise on the up and down links, is examined in detail, and it is demonstrated that the limiter can significantly affect signal detectability."

 "This paper discusses a local PCM switching network. The characteristics of this network are demonstrated with a model of three local exchanges. All subscribers are connected with the exchange via concentrators. An exchange is controlled by a central processor with a stored program. This processor interacts with the peripheral switching units, represented by the central switching network and two types of control circuits, located within the exchange. These control circuits control either the concentrators or they communicate with counterparts, situated in other local exchanges. All control functions that are not executed by programs of the central processor are realized by microprograms in a wired read-only storage (ROS) in these peripheral control circuits."
"Statistics on rainfall rates near and above the earth's surface are needed in order to estimate the percentage of time of absorption, or scattering of radio waves that affect radio system design and electrospace management. The most useful averaging time for computing such rates is on the order of 1 min or less. This paper extrapolates excessive short-duration precipitation data to provide such statistics from data routinely reported by the National Weather Service. For the 8766 h in an average year, and for a median or random location in any part of the world, the model described here estimates the fraction of time during whicht-minute average rainfall rates exceed any given value."
"This paper examines aM-ary sequential orthogonal (OM) communications system. A similarM-ary sequential pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) problem was previously considered by Hecht and Schwartz [10], and by the author. We examine the following problem: given that one of them signals is repetitively sent over an additive Gaussian channel successive intervals of time, determine the optimum sequential procedure to follow at the receiver to pick the correct signal with a probability of wrong selection no greater than\\varepsilon. The optimum procedure is defined to be one that minimizes the expected number of transmissions (sample size) before a decision is reached. This paper extends the works of Viterbi [1] and Kramer [2] who proposed two ad hoc test procedures for this OM problem. From the results of Simons [3] and Hoeffding [4], a lower bound on the expected sample size is found for any sequential test procedure for the proposed OM system. Both the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) and the simultaneous tests are shown to achieve this lower bound in the limit as\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0. Viterbi [1] computed the expected sample size for the MAP test procedure whenM = 2. For the case whereM \\geq 3, this paper derives approximations of the expected sample sizes for both the MAP and the simultaneous test procedures when\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0. Computer simulation shows that the derived expected sample size gives accurate estimation of the actual sample size whenM \\epsilon < 0.1. These sequential procedures offer 1 to 2 dB more power saving than the test procedures of Viterbi [1] and Kramer [2] if\\epsilon > 10^{-7}."
"During the 1968 and 1969 lightning seasons, member companies of the Telephone Association of Canada conducted a field investigation of lightning voltages induced in outside plant toll facilities at ten selected sites across Canada. Oscillograms of longitudinal surge voltages occurring in open wire, paired, and coaxial cable were continuously photographed with an automatic camera system especially developed for the investigation during each season. On completion, approximately 10 000 useful surge photographs were obtained and analyzed. The results indicate that a standard test wave, with 1000-V peak and10 \\times 1000-\\mus waveshape, simulates 99.8 percent of the lightning surges encountered in paired and coaxial cables. For open wire circuits, a more suitable test wave with 2000-V peak amplitude and4 \\times 200-\\mus waveshape is required to simulate 99.8 percent of the lightning surges. The number of surges per storm was found to be far higher than previously assumed. The highest recorded incidence during a storm was 484 surges greater than 10 V. Surge repetition intervals were short in all three types of facility; about 15 percent were less than 2 s. The surge information presented provides fundamental data on lightning surge effects in Canadian telephone plants which were previously unavailable. The assembled data will be of value to the protection engineer when designing future protection systems, and also to the transmission engineer concerned with noise problems."
"Selection of a particular signal set array for a bandwidthConstrained multiple phase-and-amplitude-shift-keyed (MPASK) communication system for a linear additive Gaussian noise channel requires consideration of factors such as average and/or peak power versus symbol error probability, signal amplitude dynamic range, simplicity of generation and detection, and number of bit errors per symbol error (Gray code properties). A simple technique is presented for generating and optimally detecting the honeycomb (hexagonal.) signal set, i.e., the signal set that has the tightest sphere-packing properties. The symbol and bit error probability performance of this set is compared to other two-dimensional signal sets that have been investigated in the literature, and is shown to be slightly superior from an average power standpoint. The paper concludes with a comparison of all of these signal sets from the standpoint of the factors listed above."
"The Karhunen-Loève transformation is applied to multispectral data for information extraction, SNR improvement, and data compression. When applied in the spectral dimension, the transform provides a set of uncorrelated principal component images very useful in automatic classification and human interpretation. Significant improvements in SNR and estimates of the noise variance are also shown to be possible in the spectral dimension. Data compression results using the transform on one-, two-, and three-dimensional blocks over three general types of terrain are presented."
"In-band generation of synchronous linear data signals eliminates the need for preliminary generation of a baseband signal and sharp cutoff filtering. However, the ratio of carrier frequency to pulsing rate must, in general, be an integer if the signal is to be produced by successive pulsing of a single fixed filter. As a consequence, a singlesideband signal of bandwidthWand transmission rate2Wmust occupy the frequency band [2NW,(2N +1)W],Nan integer, when it is generated from a single fixed filter. A partial-response signal satisfying this condition is described in this paper. A further analysis demonstrates that a finite number of fixed filters can be used to produce a pulse train in any band where the ratio of carrier frequency to pulsing rate is a rational number. Since this relaxed condition allows any transmission band to be approximated to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, frequency translation can be avoided. A single transversal filter with periodically varied tap weights is shown to be a practical realization."
"For a digital system with correlated digital symbols, we derive upper and lower bounds on the probability of error when the system is subject to intersymbol interference and additive Gaussian noise. The bounds are expressed in terms of the error probability obtained with a finite number of intersymbol interference terms and some parameters associated with the remainder terms. We also show that the difference between the upper and lower bounds can be made arbitrarily small and that the error probability can be computed to any desired degree of accuracy. We give some examples to illustrate the method."
"Equalization of the group delay characteristic of a satellite repeater has been examined. The channel group delay includes the transmit and receive filter group delay, and the transponder filter group delay. The perturbation of the transponder group delay of a satellite channel caused by the dual-path transmission effect resulting from an adjacent channel has also been studied. Various combinations of filter and equalizing sections have been examined. In the realization of wide passband filters, equalization of group delay presents some difficulties, especially when it is achieved by networks with many sections. The minimum peak-to-peak group delay deviation in the specified passband has been achieved by using a recent nonlinear programming technique with a penalty function approach."
"The Texas State Department of Health has been instrumental in developing an emergency medical communications network throughout the state. This type of network has proved to be a daily convenience and a priceless necessity in times of widespread disaster. It provides a basic voice communications system between hospitals, ambulances, and emergency medical personnel in the state, yet remains simple to operate and annoyance free. This network should result in significantly better emergency medical care in the state."
"A unified approach is presented for evaluation of the error probabilities of a class of digital communications systems in additive noise and interference. This class of systems includes coherent systems such asM-ary amplitude-shift keying (ASK),M-ary phase-shift keying (PSK), andM-ary amplitude-and-phase keying (APK); it also includes differential coherent systems such as binary differential PSK (DPSK). The noise is not necessarily Gaussian. The interference can be intersymbol interference, co-channel interference, adjacent-channel interference, any of their linear combinations, or intermodulation prodducts at the output of some nonlinear device. This approach essentially expands the characteristic function of the interferences into a power series so that the desired error probability can be evaluated as the sum of terms representing perturbations around the error probability due to additive noise alone. Bounds on three kinds of truncation errors, which are simple and applicable to all aforementioned digital systems, are obtained. As a result, any desired accuracy in the evaluation of the error probabilities can be achieved with this approach. In the special case in which the noise is Gaussian, explicit bounds on truncation errors are also obtained. Examples are given to illustrate how the unified analysis can be applied to evaluate the error probabilities of various digital systems. More specifically, the combined effects of Gaussian noise, intersymbol interference, and co-channel interference on the error performance ofM-ary coherent PSK and APK (MCPSK and MCAPK) systems are computed. The probability of error of a binary DPSK (BDPSK) system in the presence of Gaussian noise and intersymbol interference is analyzed. The intermodulation products at the output of a hardlimiter are also determined."
"Locking a phase-locked loop (PLL) with a sinusoid that is 100-percent AM modulated by a low-duty cycle square wave (i.e., comes in bursts) is an old and well-known technique. Despite this, certain aspects of the technique have not been systematically considered. One of the most important aspects is how to avoid sidelockan undesired mode where the loop locks to a frequency other than the sinusoid's frequency. In this paper, we explain how sidelock arises, how it can be avoided and how to provide a good lock while still avoiding sidelock. Throughout the paper our emphasis is on the situation, that is usually not considered, where the sinusoid's frequency can be considerably different than the center frequency of the voltagecontrolled oscillator (VCO)."
   "In multilevel bandpass data transmission there is usually a difference between the phase of the carrier signal and the phase of the receiver oscillator, thereby causing imperfect demodulation. The use of nonclassical Gauss quadrature rules (GQR's) allows: 1) a theoretical study of the joint effects of phase jitter, thermal noise, and intersymbol interference on average error probability; and 2) a maximum-precision sampling technique in the simulation of digital communication systems. On this basis, the mean-square-error and zero-forcing equalizers are considered, and their performances evaluated in terms of the average error probability for multilevel pulse-amplitude-modulation (PAM) and partial-response-coded (PRC) signaling schemes."

"Large-scale mobile radio systems using dynamic channel REassignment switch the channels assigned to some of the calls in progress to maintain a nearly optimum separation between coverage areas simultaneously using the same channel. Dynamic channel REassignment produces a significant increase in channel occupancy. For example, in the systems studied, which have a uniform distribution of their fixed channels and were operated against a uniform spatial distribution of offered traffic, the channel occupancy was increased by\\frac23over a pure fixed channel assignment system at a blocking rate of one percent. This corresponds to a channel savings of about 40 percent for the same traffic carried at one percent blocking by the hybrid systems that were studied."
"Cellular mobile radio systems have been proposed that use many base stations to provide radio service over a large geographical area. In such systems, a stored-program processor assigns radio channels to base stations in real time, under certain interference constraints. The capacity and the queueing characteristics of the overall system are strongly dependent on the processor algorithms that are used. This paper presents three algorithms which are in a certain minimax sense statistically optimum. The procedures are quite general, and may be applied to any system that employs many servers, the use of some combinations of which is not allowed. The first algorithm provides for the preferential assignment of a \"standard\" channel. If all standard channels are busy, a \"nonstandard\" channel is selected in such a manner that the probability of blocking is minimized in that interferable facility most likely to suffer blocking. The second algorithm provides for the transfer of service from nonstandard to standard channels whenever standard channels become free. The choice of the particular nonstandard channel to be freed is again made in a manner which minimizes the maximum probability of future blockage. The third algorithm provides for the rearrangement of channel assignments in those instances when all assignable channels, both standard and nonstandard, are busy. Such rearrangement can cause channels to become available under certain circumstances. If more than one rearrangement is possible, again the choice of what particular action should be taken is governed by the goal of minimizing the maximum probability of future blockage. All three algorithms attain short-term optimality by enumeration; that is, each candidate for assignment is considered in turn. Under the condition that the given candidate is selected, the conditional probability of future blocking in each of the server groups is calculated, and the maximum of these probabilities is associated with the candidate. After all candidates have been considered, that candidate which has the minimum associated probability is assigned. These algorithms produce, by definition, an instantaneous system state which is always optimum in the above minimax sense. In systems with large numbers of servers, the system changes state rapidly; thus, occasional short-term errors disappear rapidly, and short-term optimization tends to lead to peak performance in the long term as well."
"Analytically tractable statistical-physical models of manmade noise environments have been constructed [1]-[3]. These permit quantitative description of the various types of electromagnetic interference appearing in typical radio receivers and, in particular here, for the communication links employed in mobile transportation systems and urban environments generally. This paper presents a summary of some of the principal analytical results obtained to date [1], [4], and includes some suggested next steps for joint theoretical and experimental study of these increasingly important phenomena. Firstorder probability density functions (pdf's) and probability distributions (pd's) are obtained explicitly; (higher order pdf's and pd's may also be found by similar methods) [2]. These models are based on a Poisson distribution of sources in space. The approach is canonical, in that the results are, in form, independent of particular emitted waveforms, propagation conditions, source distributions, beam patterns, and specific system parameters, as long as the interference is narrow-band following (at least) the aperture and/or the RF stages of a typical receiver. Considered here only are the cases of communication interference, where source and receiver bandwidths are comparable. The paper concludes with a short discussion of some features of suggested future interaction between theory and experiment."
"This paper describes an adaptive retransmission system capable of providing a UHF (1 GHz) mobile radio channel with \"twoway diversity.\" The system is unique in that all signal processing associated with the diversity combining is done at the base station. A two-branch prototype of the system, without modulation, was field tested to determine its adaptive retransmission performance. These tests indicate that the statistics of the fading envelope at both the base and mobile stations closely agree with those predicted by theory for an equal gain combiner with correlation between the branches."
"A theoretical and experimental comparison of performance has been made between two types of predetection switching space diversity mobile radio systems. This comparison was made at a frequency of 840 MHz using simulated Rayleigh fading for a vehicle speed of about 80 mi/h. The switch diversity system was a conventional receiver antenna switching technique with two simulated physically separated receiving antennas and a single transmitting antenna. The feedback diversity system used a single receiving antenna with two simulated physically separated transmitting antennas. The transmitting antennas were switched remotely from the receiver. The difference in the performance of the two systems was shown to be primarily due to time delay inherent in the remote antenna switching technique."
"Federal Communication Commission Docket 18 262 allocated a 75-MHz band to the common carriers to implement high capacity mobile telephone systems. The Bell System has proposed a cellular arrangement of low-power transmitters/receivers that permits frequency reuse in a coverage area. This method of achieving spectrum efficiency will require extensive centralized coordination and control to properly administer channel assignments and to interconnect the mobiles with each other and with the direct distance dialing (DDD) network. This can be accomplished by means of an electronic switching system (ESS) with special data terminals and trunking arrangements, and a unique program. In the proposed plan the radio sites (base stations) act effectively as remote concentrators in the frequency domain under the control of ESS, which in turn acts primarily as a trunk-to-trunk switcher. In addition to the usual switching, signaling, and supervising functions, the switching office must also perform numerous special functions including paging of mobiles, location of mobiles (signal strength and ranging data analysis), channel reassignment of mobiles, and reswitching of mobiles to various base stations-these last three occurring while customers are talking."
"A variety of land mobile radio systems are compared by their spectral and economic efficiencies in providing various user services, system types covered are private one-channel, shared repeater one channel, controlled-access one-channel, trunked multichannel, and cellular. Spectral efficiency is defined to be the number of mobile users that can be served per MHz of spectrum in a core urban area, while economic efficiency is the average system cost per mobile. Both efficiencies vary with the type of usage, hence they are calculated for three major usages-mobile telephone service, dispatch service emergency, and dispatch service nonemergency. Services are described via seven \"service parameters,\" namely call holding time (average), tolerable average wait for channel access, peak busy hour utilization per mobile, audio quality (S/N), noise levels tolerable, and service range. Sensitivity of the basic results to variations in the service parameters are also computed and discussed."
"Small scale statistics of multipath propagation in a heavily built-up urban mobile radio environment are presented. The statistics cover vehicle travel distances on the order of 30 m along streets. Measuring equipment time delay resolution is about 0.1 μs. In some locations, paths with significant amplitudes are observed with excess delays of 9 to 10 μs. The delay spreads (\\sqrt{second central moment of power delay profile}) in this environment are on the order of 2 μs. Often the signal at fixed delays has a Rayleighdistributed amplitude but large departures from the Rayleigh distribution also occur. From the measurements it appears reasonable to model the urban mobile radio channel as a Gaussian quasi-wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering channel within a bandwidth of 10 MHz and for intervals along the street of up to 30 m."
"The author alleges that there is no shortage of radio spectrum, but rather, a shortage of new concepts in spectrum usage. The recent reallocation of additional frequencies to land mobile radio uses (FCC Dockets 18 261 and 18 262) provides new opportunities for innovative approaches, approaches that are free of the constraints of existing rules and regulations, existing manufacturing and engineering processes and concepts. Intending to be provocative and to initiate action and dialogue, the author challenges the technologists of this industry to come forward with innovative approaches based upon thorough, objective engineering analyses. The FCC, he contends, sorely needs factual, objective data from industry technologists in order to make the best decisions possible."
"Field measurements of mobile radio signals have shown that signal arrival is concentrated in elevation angles lower than 16°. This suggests use of an omnidirectional antenna with vertical directivity, instead of the usual whip antenna, to increase average signal strength as a further improvement in the advantages of diversity reception."
"Measurements of signal attenuation were made from a suburban hilltop base station to a mobile vehicle on several streets in the surrounding countryside. Measurements of signal strength were simultaneously made in the winter of 1971 at frequencies of 836 MHz and 11.2 GHz and then repeated in the summer to determine the effects of foliage. The presence of foliage reduced the received signal strength and the effect was more pronounced atX-band than at UHF. In cases where the shadowing obstacle was tree covered, signal levels at UHF might typically be 10 dB lower when the trees were in full leaf, whereas atX-band this additional loss could be as high as 20 dB. The experimental data was compared to values predicted by knife-edge diffraction and reasonable agreement was found."
"An often-discussed scheme for providing maximal ratio combining in mobile radio is to set the complex branch gain according to the amplitude and phase of a pilot sent with the carrier. The in-phase component of the branch signal in such a system has a simple doubleexponential distribution. These and other relevant statistics are derived."
"Using simulated Rayleigh-fading FM signals, the baseband performance of a diversity system that uses a separate pilot is studied. The effect of various RF/audio bandwidth expansion ratios is included. These results show an approach to a constant asymptotic baseband SNR for large expansion ratios, with diversity increasing this asymptote by 5 dB in the case of moderate to large interference and/or RF noise levels (9 to 15 dB below the carrier), to over 10 dB in the case of lower impairment levels (21 to 27 dB below the signal level). Assuming the usual hex-cell radio coverage plan, and a propagation law of the formr^{-n}, n = 3or 4, bandwidth expansion ratios of about three to six seem to yield the most efficient RF spectrum utilization in many practical situations. The number of required channel subsets (cells) is strongly influenced by the propagation law ranging from about 19 forn = 3, to about 7 forn = 4."
"A commonly used model for signal fading in many types of communication channels is that the amplitude of the received signal at a given time is a Rayleigh-distributed random variable. In this paper we show how classical statistical techniques may be applied to the problem of estimating the Rayleigh distribution parameter (i.e., the mean), given samples from the distribution. In particular, we first consider the problem of estimating the population mean, given a sequence of independent samples. We derive an unbiased maximum-likelihood estimator. We show that this estimator is unique, and since it is based on a sufficient statistic, it is therefore \"best\" in the Blackwell-Rao sense of minimizing expected loss. Using this estimator, we then develop confidence intervals whose length can be used as a guide in selecting the required sample size. We then consider the same estimation problem when the signal samples are obtained from the output of a logarithmic receiver. We derive an interval estimator which does not require taking the antilogs of the log samples, and which is not appreciably worse than the \"best\" estimator."
"The correlation between signals received by two mobile radio base-station antennas is investigated to determine spacing requirements for space diversity. Measurements of the fading of UHF signals received by two base-station horn antennas oriented at different angles with respect to the incoming mobile radio signal were made for different antenna spacings. The experimental results are compared with an analytical expression derived in this paper; they agree fairly well. A further experiment was made after removing the possible local scatterers surrounding the base station. Comparing these two experimental results, we find that the following are true. 1) Propagation in the direction of a line connecting the two base-station antennas is the critical case and requires a large separation of 70 wavelengths. As soon as the incoming wave is 10° away from the inline axis, the spacing requirement drops to 30 wavelengths. 2) Local scatterers at the base station tend to decrease the correlation between signals received at the two antennas. We conclude that an upper limit to the spacing of antennas used for diversity can be obtained and that it is within the achievable range."
"A simple device to simulate the Rayleigh distributed fast fading encountered in mobile radio is described and evaluated. The Rayleigh envelope statistics are obtained by adding two independent Gaussian noise source in quadrature. The theoretical spectrum of the received signal is approximated by shaping the spectrum of the noise sources with filters. A design is given whose performance is shown to agree very closely with theory."
"This paper describes in detail the criteria for the design of a mobile laboratory for the characterization and measurement of manmade electromagnetic noise in the urban, suburban, and rural environment. A significant difference from previous similar measurements is the bandwidth of the receiving system, which is here of the order of 1 MHz. A simple model is proposed to describe the impulsive noise together with a series of experiments to validate the model and determine the significant necessary parameters. The detailed requirements for each of the subsystems of the mobile laboratory are discussed and some typical results obtained in trial runs are presented."
"This paper deals with two aspects of the investigations of mobile data transmission. The first aspect shows the equipment for measuring and recording of parameters that influence the transmission. The second aspect shows the development of an analog simulation of the data transmission with the possibility of adjusting significant parameters independently. Finally the applicability of the model is verified by comparison between simulation and actual transmission."
"A low cost switched diversity receiving system has been developed for use in UHF-FM mobile radio. The input of a single receiver is switched back and forth between two antennas upon command from a signal level sensing logic circuit. The system has been measured on simulated Rayleigh fading channels and has been found to give a significant improvement to both voice and data signals."
"This paper reports the results of an investigation of the increase in traffic capacity in a cellular high capacity mobile telecommunications system attainable with dynamic instead of fixed channel assignment. Three dynamic channel assignment algorithms were studied by simulation using a 21-cell hexagonal array as a representative system layout. Detailed results for each algorithm are presented. For the particular system studied, traffic capacity can be increased by approximately 25 percent with dynamic channel assignment. A general upper bound on this increase has been found."
"Many mobile telephone and personal paging systems require signaling simultaneously from multiple transmitters. This paper analyzes the factors that cause paging errors due to interference when the signaling format consists of audio tones sent simultaneously from two FM transmitters. The factors considered are: drift in carrier and modulation frequencies, and misequalization of land-line amplitude and audio delay. The following results are shown: 1) the interference errors are eliminated if the land lines are amplitude and phase equalized, 2)if the lines are not equalized but the modulation frequencies are equal, then the interference errors can be decreased by an order of magnitude if the transmitters are mistuned such that their difference carrier frequency is just greater than the modulation tone filter bandwidth in the receiver, and 3) if the modulation frequencies are slightly different, then the interference errors can be decreased somewhat by misequalizing the modulation indicies. It is then concluded that if the land lines are not equalized and the signaling tones are not exactly equal, the interference errors cannot be eliminated, but can be decreased by properly aligning the system."
"If a server group carrying short-holding-time queued traffic at high blocking probability is combined with another server group carrying normal blocked-calls-cleared traffic at low blocking probability, the resulting mixed group will in many cases operate at an intermediate blocking probability. Thus the mixed group provides better service to the queued traffic, while degrading the service of the cleared traffic. If the random arrival characteristics of the short-holding-time traffic are suitably modified by delaying calls an appropriate time before service, then the grades of service for both types of traffic may be engineered independently. An example of a possible use of this technique of induced delay, the combining of dispatch and mobile-telephone traffic on the same set of radio channels in the High-Capacity Mobile Telecommunications System, is discussed."
"Land mobile systems currently use vertically polarized antennas while trying to solve the problem of small sector signal variations, which are greater for vertical polarization than for either horizontal or circular polarization; This difference in small sector variations is shown from results of tests at 430 MHz. The variations at 900 MHz should be more rapid and have amplitudes at least as great as those shown for 450 MHz. At 900 MHz antennas can be made small for mobile service and the improvements noted here may spur developments in circularly polarized antennas."
"Diversity reception techniques can help to combat fast fading in urban areas, and this paper describes some predetection combining systems designed to be compatible with existing standard receivers. Quantitative results show that a worthwhile improvement in quality of reception can be obtained with small numbers of antennas. There are advantages to be gained if, in future receiving systems, the diversity technique is incorporated directly into the receiver design."

 "LTS (Lincoln Training System) is an automated training system that has been designed to meet the need for individualized, selfpaced learning outside of as well as within a conventional classroom environment. The system employs microfiche as the basic medium for storing and distributing instructional material. A solid-state electrooptical reader has been developed to permit storage of audio and branching logic on the fiche along with the usual high quality visual material. The concept in the form of a system (LTS-3) has been successfully tested in the electronics training program at Keesler Air Force Base. The results show a 37 percent reduction in training time, which implies a large cost savings."
  "Beam position control in beam waveguides subject to statistical variations is studied. Variations in alignment and component values cause the beam to be displaced from the guide axis. A control system to correct this displacement is described. Both the expected and the rms values of the beam position are discussed. An approximate expression for the stability conditions is determined."
"A time-domain technique is presented for the design of frequency-sampling and transversal digital filters for use in equalizing channels with known impulse responses. The technique uses a linearprogramming algorithm to specify filter multiplier coefficients that satisfy constraint equations based upon specified values and derivatives of the desired output signal. It is shown that the transversal equalizer design requires fewer multipliers and performs in a superior fashion in the presence of timing jitter. The effects of changing the number and type of constraints upon such parameters as equalizer complexity, transmitted energy, and residual distortion are presented."
"An algorithm to find the Hamiltonian circuit in a bipath network is developed. Using the Hamiltonian circuit all cutsets of a bipath network are generated from incidence sets in a systematic way without duplication. Also it is shown that the algorithm to find the Hamiltonian circuit can be used to test a graph for bipathness."

"This paper provides a basic description of the No. 1 electronic automatic exchange (EAX) call-processing and metering software programs. The call-processing portion of the paper describes how the callprocessing program and the call-processing data base provide the system with the originating, digit analysis, charge analysis, routing, and terminating phases of setting up a call. The metering portion of the paper describes the various metering packages that provide a measure of the amounts of traffic and traffic patterns in an office. In addition a description of how these metering packages are activated and canceled and how the metering data are displayed and output is provided."

"The practice described herein provides instruction on the testing of distribution transformers as voice-frequency noise generators, to measure the degree to which they may contribute to electrical noise in communication circuits that are in parallel with the power supply circuits serving the transformers. Transformers have a characteristic common to other iron-core devices of causing harmonic currents at voice-frequencies to flow in supply circuits to the transformers. The magnitudes of these currents, and of interference that may result, vary according to design of the transformer as well as excitation voltage. The tests described in this practice provide a standard method for use by the transformer manufacturer, user and others in industry for the purpose of better evaluating the design choices available and moving toward industry objectives as to levels of harmonic exciting current expressed asI . T[current × telephone influence factor (TIF)]."
"This paper discusses the application of the No. 1 EAX system as a class 5 or a combined class 4 and 5 office. All hardware subsystems are briefly described, and the major software programs are introduced. System features from manufacturing through subscriber features to maintenance features are described, and the system capacity is discussed in terms of traffic and directory numbers."
"Suitability of a switching system to solve wide and diverse application problems as well as the general case, is largely determined by its switching plan. In No. 1 EAX, the strategy of the plan is to establish a flexibility in internal network trunking that allows separation of traffic by type, directional flow, and intensity. The three major network divisions-line, selector, and trunk registerare sectionalized accordingly and are positioned relative to each other so as to avoid wasted motion in setting a call to completion. Control, supervision, and maintenance of the network are arranged to better utilize machine capacity by relieving the processor of high volume routine jobs."
"In a digital toll switching office a digital multifrequency (MF) receiver may be more economical than the present analog MF receiver. This paper suggests an algorithm that could be used for digital implementation of such a receiver. The algorithm employs discrete Fourier transform and leads to more efficient design than a system using second-order digital bandpass filters. The presented results of computer simulation of the digital MF receiver employing this method indicate satisfactory performance and good immunity to random noise interference."
"This correspondence defines a new set of precision tone frequencies for digitally generating normal progress tones in a PCM switching environment. The technique of generating the progress tones is similar to the one described for digital multiple frequency (MF) tone senders in which the tone is generated by reading a memory store that contains the binary words representing a presynthesized waveform [1]. New frequency combinations are derived that minimize storage requirements by taking advantage of the allowable frequency tolerances to force waveform symmetry with respect to the sampling period."
"Communication channels with no transmission at dc require data encoding to eliminate dc from the signal. Many coding schemes have been developed for this purpose. The scheme discussed here uses code blocks with equal numbers of plus and minus pulses, according to a previously published algorithm. This code is compared to a three-level \"bipolar\" coding scheme in terms of spectral characteristics, efficiency, crosstalk noise, power requirements, and hardware requirements. Circuitry is described for coders, decoders, and repeaters. Extensions to other code types are discussed briefly."
"The importance and objectives of maintainability to a telephone switching system are reviewed.

The layout of the repair manual is also presented."
"This paper describes the common control subsystem of the No. 1 electronic automatic exchange (EAX) switch. The data-processing unit is a high-speed interrupt-driven general-purpose computer. It is broken down into its component parts of control, memories, communication channels, and input/output and its functions are described. The register-sender, a hard-wired preprocessor that handles both incoming and outgoing signaling for the switch is described, together with its relationship with the space-divided junctor circuits. The level of redundancy and its effect on the system structure and organization are described and discussed."
"A generalization of information theory is presented with the aim of distinguishing the direction of information flow for mutually coupled statistical systems. The bidirectional communication theory refers to two systems. Two directed transinformations are defined which are a measure of the statistical coupling between the systems. Their sum equals Shannon's transinformation. An information flow diagram explains the relation between the directed transinformations and the entropies of the sources. An extension to a group of such systems has also been proposed. The theory is able to describe the informational relationships between living beings and other multivariate complex systems as encountered in economy. An application example referring to group behavior with monkeys is given."
"This paper describes a digital demodulator for phase-shift-keyed (PSK) signals in which the phase difference between the received signal and a carrier reference is found by measuring digitally the time interval between the zero crossings of the signal and the reference. In the case of coherent detection the reference is locked to one of theMpossible phases of the signal. The advantage of this demodulator is that bulky low-pass filters and delay lines as well as critical threshold devices can be dispensed with. On the other hand, digital measurement of the phase and the use of a finite-width sampling window lead to degradation of the error performance. This degradation is theoretically analyzed for both coherent and phase-comparison detection. The quantizing error proves to be small enough when the phase difference is coded into a 6-b binary number, and the theoretical results are in good agreement with measurements taken from an experimental phase-comparison demodulator for fourand eight-level PSK signals. The experimental demodulator is also described in the paper."
"In a recent paper [1] we reported on a new mean-square error automatic equalizer utilizing Rosen's gradient projection theorem to optimize parameters in the discrete frequency domain. Here we develop another projection method to optimize the discrete frequency parameters. The algorithm converges (in the mean) for any channel, even in the presence of noise. It is shown that for the channels considered, convergence is equivalent to comparable time domain equalizers. The method makes use of fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms for computation of the iteration matrix, the gradient, and the projection operation. Use of the FFT for parameter iterations reduces the necessary computations per parameter to a number proportional tolog_{2} Mcompared toMfor a time domain equalizer, whereMis the number of equalizer parameters. The method results in fewer computations per parameter for each iteration, but a somewhat slower rate of convergence than the method employing Rosen's gradient projection."
"The probability density function of PCM encoded speech signals has been measured, and it has been found that, as a result of companding, the distribution is rather flat except in the neighborhood of the zero level. On the basis of the measured probability density function (PDF) a variable length prefix code was developed that allows an increase in the traffic capacity of PCM transmission systems. The benefit obtained is mainly due to the high probability of the zero level. According to the proposed coding method, inactive channels are maintained by sending only one code bit per frame; they thus can be activated without delay and without signaling. This is an advantage with respect to the time assignment speech interpolation (TASI) system [1].In the paper the capability of this method has been investigated."
"In much theoretical work, the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion is used as a basis of design for receivers of dispersed digital signals in the presence of noise. A variant of this criteria that is also frequently used is the MMSE with the constraint of zero intersymbol interference (OISI). In this discussion we compare the probability of errorP(e)of receivers designed with the MMSE and MMSE-OISI criterion with a receiver designed by computer minimization ofP(e)by variation of pole locations of a fixed order filter. The performance of these receivers is then compared with the isolated pulse lower bound and the probability of error of the maximum likelihood receiver. These Comparisons are made for a channel that is an approximation to 6000 ft of twisted pair paper insulated cable with a transmission rate of 1.5 Mb."
"Transmission lines exhibit a center frequency\\omega_{0} = \\sqrt{(R/L)(G/C)}about which several interesting phenomena can be observed when plotted on double log paper. The magnitude of the characteristic impedance manifests \"double mirror\" symmetry, with the impedance being greater below this frequency than above, whenR/L > G/C, and less if the converse is true. The impedance angle has a mirror symmetry about ω0, and is constrained to values between\\pm45\\deg, with negative values whenR/L > G/C. Further, the angle of the propagation functions, α and β, and the velocity of propagation all possess double mirror symmetry. γ is asymmetrical. The behavior of all of these parameters is such that each can be presented in a normalized plot of the form (P(m\\omega_{0})/P(\\omega_{0})) and centered upon ω0."

 "A general method is presented for determining not merely the output spectrum resulting from a nonlinear transformation of signals and noise but also the signal × signal distortion and intermodulation components, including their phases and their precise forms as functions of time. Recent work by Jain is thereby illuminated and generalized."
"This paper examines the analog methods presently used in carrying digital signal via the terrestrial microwave radio relay systems. It then summarized the state of the art of two proposed digital radio systems, operating above and below 10 GHz. It also highlights some of the problem areas yet to be solved, with particular emphasis on these design problems associated with the high-capacity system. An extensive bibliography is given for easy reference."
"Simultaneous two-way (full-duplex) data transmission in the same bandwidth normally requires separate channels, and in the telephone network is realized by using a four-wire circuit. This paper reports on investigations directed toward full-duplex operation on a two-wire circuit using a hybrid coupler and a passband automatic transversal filter at each end of the circuit to separate the two signals. Full-duplex binary transmission at a rate of 2000 Bd in each direction has been experimentally demonstrated on a limited number of twowire circuits. Photographs of eye patterns are provided to illustrate the substantial improvement over operation with hybrids alone. Limitations on performance due to unstable distant echoes are described."
"Convolutional encoding with biphase modulation is an attractive combination of modulation/coding for the Gaussian channel, but a means of tracking carrier phase must be provided. The performance of combined sequential decoding and suppressed carrier (Costas loop) tracking in the receiver is difficult to analyze but can be obtained by computer simulations. Results of such simulations are presented in the form of a Pareto fit to the computation distributions for various tracking loop bandwidths and demodulator quantization (soft decisions). These distributions are applied to predict probability of error performance for typical decoder parameters (buffer size, speed factor). The anticipated advantage of quantized demodulation is observed. However, narrow tracking bandwidths are required, with sufficient interleaving to overcome effects of correlated phase perturbations due to noise."
"We derive upper and lower bounds on the probability of error ofM-ary CPSK systems subject to intersymbol interference and additive Gaussian noise. The bounds are expressed in terms of the error probability obtained with a finite pulse train and some parameters associated with the residual pulse train. Methods are given to compute the probability of error with a finite number of interference terms and it is shown that the difference between the upper and the lower bounds is a monotone decreasing function of the number of pulses in the finite pulse train. The applicability of the method to compute the probability of error with any desired degree of accuracy is illustrated by examples for quaternary and octonary systems."
"A new diversity technique has been developed that uses message waveforms consisting of a sequence of RF bursts at a number of different frequencies. Furthermore, the ensemble of message sequences is a code with large minimum Hamming distance. Hence, reliable communications are possible in spite of channel fading and additive noise. The new diversity technique has been integrated into a troposcatter communication system that was first tested in 1967. The new technique is illustrated and its performance predicted assuming both correlated and uncorrelated fading between the RF frequencies. A particular code is presented that achieves a 4-dB coding improvement beyond that generally obtained using binary modulation and frequency diversity techniques of the same order. Theoretical predictions of system performance and actual empirical data taken on two operational links agree very closely."
"A feedback scheme for regulating error probability on slowly fading communication channels is described and analyzed. In this selective diversity system, only the bestRofLavailable diversity subchannels are used, the selection being revised from moment to moment. Comparison with conventional diversity transmission on an 8-channel system shows a performance improvement ranging from 20.8 to 9.5 dB, where the low figure corresponds to constant power operation of the transmitter and a typical value of round-trip delay. A novel feature of selective diversity is that, for moderate SNR, the error probability decreases to zero as a strong inverse power ofL, the order of diversity, which contrasts with behavior of conventional systems in which increasingLcauses the error probability to decrease to a nonzero lower bound. The implication is that the figures quoted above can be improved indefinitely by increasing the order of diversity."
"In this paper a nonlinear analysis of a multifilter phase-lock loop (MPLL) by using the method of \"harmonic balance\" is presented. The particular MPLL considered has a low-pass filter and a bandpass filter in parallel. An analytic expression for the relationship between the input signal phase deviation and the phase error is determined for sinusoidal FM in the absence of noise. The expression is used to determine bounds on the proper operating region for the MPLL and to investigate the \"jump phenomenon\" previously observed. From these results the proper modulation index, modulating frequency, etc., used for the design of an MPLL is determined. Data for the loop unlock boundary obtained from the theoretical expression are compared to data obtained from analog computer simulations of the MPLL."
"A highly efficient subcarrier modulation technique, suppressed clock pulse duration modulation (SCPDM) has been developed that outperforms narrow-band frequency modulation in very noisy channels. Developed primarily for hard limiting satellite repeaters, the technique utilizes a phase-shift key (PSK) carrier and phase-lock demodulators. The SCPDM technique is shown to be extremely useful and cost effective where the overall objective is to obtain maximum traffic rather than toll quality voice communication. Design considerations are discussed and test data from a typical hardware implementation are presented."

"An adaptive sequential bit synchronizer for a random squarewave data process is proposed in this paper. The probability distributions of the signal parameters and noise process are assumed unknown. The synchronization algorithms, implemented on a small computer, are capable of accurately estimating pulse transition time, pulse amplitude, and pulsewidth simultaneously by invoking the Gauss-Markov theorem. Numerous simulations indicate that the performance of the synchronizer is satisfactory from the points of view of the amount of data required and the speed of convergence."
"An adaptive delta modulator for television signals has been implemented in which the step magnitude depends on the four most recent sign bits. Overshoot limits the largest step size that can be used: to overcome this limitation an overshoot suppression scheme has been devised, considerably improving picture quality. An adaptive 2-bit differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM) system is also described."
"Various image coding schemes have been studied for digital transmission of videophone signals. The Hadamard transform, which is now studied for the transmission of pictures such as those from satellites, has been considered too complicated for public use, though the characteristics such as the ratio of bit-rate reduction are more desirable than those of differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM). We have found a very simple scheme of the transform, where digitized videophone signals are transformed to Hadamard components all digitally just byndigital adders and some shift registers for 2nth-order transform. For example, three adders are necessary for eighth-order transform. It is extendable to two-dimensional transform with ease. We have made an experimental model running in real time. Experiments and theoretical calculation have shown that 3 bits/sample are required for good picture quality in the case of two-dimensional(4 \\times 2)th transform and 0.5 bits more for one-dimensional eighthorder transform."
"A coherent demodulator is described which is particularly well suited to digital implementation. Its important features are that no low-pass filter is required to eliminate double-frequency terms and that the passband signal need be sampled at only twice the highest frequency of the baseband signal, rather than at twice the highest frequency of the passband signal. A demodulator of this type will be useful in those systems that do not require passband digital signal processing for other purposes."
"The concept of combining the design of the error-correcting-coding approach and the modulation format is treated in general terms and its effectiveness is demonstrated by a specific implementation referred to as Codem I. A new decoding algorithm is presented, which has the interesting property that the only channel measurement information utilized is the relative reliability of each received digit. The effectiveness of this decoding technique is demonstrated by computer simulation over three different channel models for dispersive channels. Comparisons of the performance of Codem I with the more conventional 16-tone (four-phase DPSK) HF modem are obtained by actual field results as well as by computer simulations. Improvement in error probability in the region of two orders of magnitude is demonstrated when both systems are operating under similar channel conditions and at equal data rates. A further improvement is demonstrated when channel measurement information is used to reject a small percentage (typically less than 3 percent) of codewords that are considered unreliable."
"Recent interest in the application of Walsh functions suggests that Haar functions, close relatives of Walsh functions, may also be useful. In this primarily tutorial paper, Haar functions are reviewed briefly and the computational and memory requirements of the Haar transform are analyzed; applications are then discussed. It is concluded that, whereas Haar functions are unlikely to be useful in as many applications as Walsh functions may be, they seem especially well suited to data coding, edge detection, and, perhaps, multiplexing."
"This paper considers digitized Weaver modulators for single-sideband modulation that can be used in radio communications and telemetering. A system of 12 such modulators to process 12 analog signals digitally is replaced by six multiplex modulators at the cost of additional computation at the input but with an overall reduction in computation time and a higher degree of accuracy. A unique digital filter is developed that can interpolate and output samples at multiples of the input sampling rate and exhibits a passband that occurs above the Nyquist frequency with no apparent distortion effects. A discussion of the Fortran simulation of a combined modulator-demodulator structure is included to verify the effectiveness of this scheme."
"Automatic equalization for digital systems often has as its immediate goal the minimization of some cost function that depends explicitly on the values of intersymbol interference, and thus implicitly on the tap settings. For ease of implementation it is often desirable to slightly modify the conventional distortion measures. A theoretical comparison of several such criteria, some of which are of the peak distortion variety and some of which are of the mean-square class, is made. With one exception, the tap settings that minimize the modified mean-square criteria yield to first-order identical values for the conventional quadratic cost function. All the analogous peak distortion criteria result in zero forcing of sample values, provided that the binary eye is open. Some comments about automatic equalization that are of a tutorial nature are also made."
"The exact value of the probability of error is computed for binary communication systems with sampling detector or integrating-and-dumping detector, with nonreturn-to-zero or split-phase signals and single-pole filters in the receiver and transmitter. The effect of nonoptimal sampling time on the probability of error is presented."
"It is shown that a suitable adaptive receiver for digital communication over noisy dispersive unknown channels consists of an adaptive prefilter followed by an adaptive equalizer. The adaptive receiver is optimized by a minimization of the overall receiver mean-square error. The resultant adaptive receiver requires a dummy equalizer to supply a control signal for adjusting the tap gains of the prefilter."
"Considering the recovery of carrier phase and timing for optimum detection of a single-sideband data signal, a relation is derived for simultaneous optimum setting of these parameters. To find the optimum settings, it is shown that the mean-square error (MSE) of the demodulated signal, defined as the sum of the squared deviations of the received signal from the nearest possible level of an undistorted signal, is a useful measure of carrier phase and timing errors only near the optimum settings, so that a rough estimate of both carrier phase and timing must be available at the receiver."
"Straightforward implementation of a maximum likelihood decoder implies a complexity that grows algebraically with the inverse of error probability. Forney has suggested an approach, concatenation, for which error probability decreases exponentially with increasing complexity. This paper presents the results of an evaluation of a particular concatenation system, structurally similar to the hybrid system of Falconer, employing a Reed-Solomon outer code and an inner convolutional code. The inner decoder is a Viterbi decoder of constraint length less than the corresponding encoding constraint length (nonmaximum likelihood). The outer decoder assumes one of three possible forms, all employing the likelihood information developed by the inner decoder to assist in outer decoding. Error corrections and erasure fill-ins achieved by the outer decoder are fed back to the inner decoder. Performance is evaluated through computer simulation. The three outer decoders are found to provide approximately the same performance, all yielding low error probabilities at rates somewhat above Rcompof sequential decoding and at signal energy to noise density ratios per information bit around 1.7 dB."
"This paper presents an upper bound on error-pattern probabilities for digital pulse-amplitude modulation transmission in a bandrestricted and additive white noise environment. The bound involves the computation of exponential and hyperbolic cosine functions. For two examples from the literature it yields a result that is an improvement on previously known results. For the case of double errors it is not as restrictive as a recently published bound."
"Interest is increasing in thermoplastic insulated and jacketed cables that are filled to minimize the entry and flow of water within the core. Such cable designs provide reliable, stable transmission characteristics, particularly for the increasingly popular pulse-code modulation (PCM) systems. This paper explores the primary and secondary electrical parameters of filled telephone cables in the voice and carrier frequency range. In addition, data are presented on nearend and far-end crosstalk."
"We show that the error signal incurred by block quantizing stationary data is nonstationary under some conditions. Examples are presented that indicate that the mean square error is largest at the block edges. When block quantizers are used to encode pictures at low bit rates, this effect tends to make the block edges visible in the reconstructed picture."
"A recent article by Omura and Shaft [1] proposed modeling atmospheric radio noise as a narrow-band process having a lognormal envelope distribution. Based on such a model, an approximate expression is derived for the envelope probability distribution of a sinusoidal carrier in atmospheric radio noise. The results are compared with measured distribution of the instantaneous amplitude out of a wide-band envelope detector Watt and Plush [2], and show good agreement over the range of input carrier-to-noise ratios for which measurements were made."
"When an injection-locked oscillator is used to amplify a frequency division multiplexing-frequency modulation FDM-FM signal, second- and third-order distortions are found to exist. Explicit expressions are derived that give the signal-to-distortion ratio (NPR) as a function of the locking bandwidth, frequency offset, and various modulation parameters. These formulas are believed to be valid within the limits of the assumptions made."
"A new method is presented to compute the average probability of error in the presence of intersymbol interference and additive noise for multilevel pulse-amplitude-modulation (PAM) and partial-response-coded (PRC) signaling schemes. The method is based upon nonclassical Gauss quadrature rules (GQR) and suffers no limitation on noise statistics, so that it applies also for non-Gaussian noise. Moreover it yields some remarkable advantages as compared with other methods, in particular, with the series expansion method that has recently received considerable attention. Expressions for the truncation error are also given and their derivation is reported in the Appendix. Finally, examples of applications are presented and comparisons with other methods are carried out."
"Research involved in the development of a radio communication system for use in coal mine disasters is described. Theoretically predicted field strengths for surface to mine and mine to surface propagation are compared with measurements in coal mines in Colorado and Pennsylvania. It is concluded that surface-to-mine voice communication is practical using a horizontal wire antenna operating at audio frequencies, and that mine-to-surface interrupted CW signaling is practical using multiple-turn horizontal loop antennas. This research has resulted in an emergency through-the-earth communication system that is being evaluated by the U.S. Bureau of Mines for use in mine rescue operations."
"A mathematical model based on queuing theory is described. This model assists the choice of buffer size necessary for an intermittent digital transmission system. The influence of any type of interruption on the data transmission can be evaluated. Comparison among different message transmission formats can be carried out in order to choose the one that best corresponds to the overall requirements."

"This paper gives details of the pulse-position modulation technique as applied in the case of a pulsed room-temperature-operated GaAs laser diode for communication purposes. The input analog signal is converted into a digital format and information transmission takes place through the laser pulses occurring at different positions in time. Special care is taken to synchronize the receiver with the transmitter. At the receiver the analog information is reconstructed. The technique can be incorporated in the development of a short-haul point-point-to-point voice communication system using the laser diode."
"A statistical decision procedure for acquisition of a codedbinary noncoherent-frequency-shift-keyed (NCFSK) signal in a multiple-message one-shot transmission system is suggested. Performance of the system is also presented."
"A baseband hybrid digital transmission scheme is studied, and it is shown that the low- and high-frequency cutoffs in analog repeaters extremely degrade signal waveforms. Solutions studied are a combination of dc-constrained coding and modification of amplitude-frequency characteristics for low-frequency distortion, and a combination of flat amplitude equalization and simple phase equalization for high-frequency distortion. It is shown that these solutions reduce waveform distortions by a factor of ten. A solution of the control problem for automatic gain control (AGC) is also presented."
 "This paper describes a computer program for simulating 4phase digital transmission through a multitransponder satellite link. It takes account of intersymbol and adjacent channel interference and TWT nonlinearity. Results presented include the effects of different TWT characteristics, bit rates, and filter characteristics."
"Significant improvement in the signal-to-noise performance of television signals has been obtained through the application of comb filtering techniques. This improvement is achieved by removing the inherent redundancy in the television signal through linear prediction and by utilizing the unique noise-rejection characteristics of the receiver comb filter. Theoretical and experimental results describe the signal-to-noise ratio and picture-quality improvement obtained through the use of baseband comb filters and the implementation of a comb network as the loop filter in a phase-lock-loop demodulator. Attention is given to the fact that noise becomes correlated when processed by the receiver comb filter. The subjective effect of line-to-line and pictureelement-picture-element-picture-element (PE-PE) correlation on noise visibility is discussed and demonstrated."
"Phase-lock acquisition time of a perfect (proportional plus integral control) second-order phase-lock loop (PLL) in the presence of narrow-band Gaussian noise is studied by means of computer simulation. 100 nonoverlapping sequences of pseudorandom noise are generated. In the presence of each noise sequence, phase-lock acquisition is simulated at each of five pairs of initial phase error φ0and initial frequency error φ0. For each(\\phi_{0},\\phi_{0})with each noise sequence, phase-lock acquisition is simulated at nine different ratios of signal-to-noise energy at the PLL input. If the PLL phase detectors were linear rather than sinusoidal, the range of PLL output signal-to-noise ratios simulated would extend from 4 to 50 dB. The 4500 acquisitions of phase lock simulated are represented by 45 distribution functions that explicitly indicate the effect of PLL output signal-to-noise ratio on PLL phase-lock acquisition time."
"A method is proposed and evaluated for coding a notched scan that jumps back and forth between adjacent scan lines of a normal raster. Alternate points in the line are coded using the normal differential quantizer algorithm while the remaining points use a nonlinear predictor proposed by Graham. The advantage of the algorithm over normal differential quantization is that the prediction strategy is improved while the advantage over other two-dimensional strategies is that the effect of transmission errors is confined to the line pair being processed and does not spread vertically. For coarse coding there is a significant improvement in picture quality when compared with normal differential quantization while for high-quality pictures there is a small reduction in entropy. The effect of transmission errors is investigated and shown to be similar to the effect with normal differential quantization."
"A new approach to design of a recursive image enhancer is introduced when the image is characterized statistically by its mean and correlation function. A vector linear dynamical model is derived to represent the statistics of the processor output when several lines of the picture are processed simultaneously. Based on the vector model, a Kalman filter is designed and utilized to recursively enhance the image. The vector processing results in a simpler and more accurate image enhancement algorithm in comparison with scalar processing. Two examples, one with very low signal-to-noise ratio, are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the procedure. Finally, the performance of the vector and scalar estimators is compared."
"A regional communication satellite system is being planned for Europe to satisfy the future needs of the European Conference of Post and Telecommunication Administration (CEPT) and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). A model of the mission for the satellite system, based on the estimated future traffic requirements of the potential customers, has been defined to serve as a basis for system design. Starting with the postulated traffic model and with a review of the various system constraints, the present paper defines the parameters and the tradeoffs leading to the choice of the communication techniques fulfilling the requirements of the mission model. The resulting baseline communication system and its major characteristics are described. Alternate system design options are presented and commented upon. Some of these options would enhance the performance of the system but would generally involve more advanced techniques and would represent a larger technological risk. Finally, research and development topics in the field of communication technology are identified. Some of these topics are being investigated and some of the results are described in other papers."
"A cumulative decision scheme that can be employed in a feedback communication system is treated. Any decision to decode depends upon all messages that have been received prior to the decision. The average error over all transmissions as well as the forward error may be controlled. Performance is compared to an error-detection repeat-request noncumulative scheme utilizing group codes. Optimal performance of the cumulative scheme with respect to the noncumulative scheme is given for short-length best group codes. It is also demonstrated that the use of feedback does not necessarily increase appreciably the amount of hardware necessary to effect error control."
"Measurements of linear cross polarization and attenuation on a terrestrial link in the U.K. are reported and correlated with rainfall information. The cross polarization measured during rainfall is compared with theoretically predicted values and monthly cross-polar statistics are presented for a 16-month period."
"The capture capability of a type of hybrid-locked loop (HLL) in a noisy environment has been shown to be better than that of a conventional phase-locked loop (PLL). An approximate method of estimating the locking range and the locking time of the HLL in the noisy environment has been presented. Also given are the experimental results in partial support of the conclusions of the analysis."
"The problem of finding the optimum tapped delay line (TDL) gain settings for a digital communications receiver with a detection process involving a single threshold level (zero volts) is examined. Based on a minimax criterion which seeks to maximize the eye opening-to-rms noise ratio, an optimum set of tap gains is found with the aid of a geometric construction inn-dimensional space. An iterative procedure for calculating the tap gains is derived from then-dimensional space concepts. With some slight modifications, the same procedure is used to obtain the optimum TDL when the detection process involves two threshold levels(\\pm E volts). The optimization scheme described by Lucky is also given a geometric interpretation so that the two methods can be compared; in some cases, they yield identical results."
"Telecommunication satellites were first used as a means for establishing alternative transoceanic routes in competition with existing submarine cables. The use of advanced techniques in conjunction with the multitime-zone coverage makes it possible for transoceanic satellite systems to compete favorably with conventional intercontinental transmission means. This paper concerns itself with methods for economically applying satellite techniques to European conditions in competition with a finely meshed land-based relatively cheap coaxial cable system. Under these conditions every effort must be made to obtain the highest possible efficiency. The national gateways to the international telecommunication network are to see the satellite system as an equivalent trafficcarrying means capable of handling 30-70 percent of the total interEuropean traffic. It is therefore necessary to regard the satellite system, consisting of earth stations and satellite, as if it were a supranational switching center for international traffic. An essential ingredient in such a solution is a system global control. This global control is proposed to be implemented by computer means intercorrelated by means of common signaling channel methods. Principles and means of implementation of the principles are outlined."
 "Range extension allows the No. 2 electronic switching system (No. 2 ESS) to serve subscriber loops out to 2500 Ω as part of the Bell system's unigauge plan. Range-extender circuits provide both audio and dc gain for loops greater than 1300 Ω. These circuits have been designed specifically to be low cost, as small as possible, and to use minimum power. Network concentration allows 70 percent fewer range extenders to be provided than customer lines served. All trunk, service, and test circuits that had to be modified to work range extended are provided on a standard basis in every No. 2 ESS office. This means that range extension can be provided in a No. 2 ESS office at very low cost; essentially the cost of the range-extender circuits."

"This paper considers the problem of estimating the offset in timing of like events at geographically separated locations as a basis for establishing common knowledge of time and, hence, system synchronism. Configurations discussed involve interrogation and reply between a user and a single donor, and one-way propagation between a user and the multiple sites of a reference system. The latter category includes navigation systems, which are shown to be appropriate means for disseminating time. Further ramifications of time dissemination are discussed, including the characteristics of clocks suitable for airborne application. Variables and their relationship and solution are defined for stationary and moving users, and for users of atomic and crystal clocks. For the case in which frequency is offset between clocks, as is likely when crystal oscillators are used, methods are described that permit the estimate of offset in frequency as well as in time. Recursive minimum-variance methods are examined in some detail, and a parametric analysis of performance relative to random and systematic sources of error is given."
"An efficient multiplexing approach that achieves good intermodulation distortion performance by effectively trading off modulation power improvement is described. Emphasis is on practical application to aircraft communications systems via a relay satellite."
"The Department of Defense currently operates about 30 000 aircraft, the largest most varied single fleet of aircraft of those using the National Aviation System (NAS). For this and other important reasons discussed herein, military participation in evolving an efficient and effective NAS forces consideration of a number of important issues by the developers and operators of any future Air Traffic Control (ATC) system. These issues range from those critical aspects of national security and the sovereignty of our air space, through major economic factors in equipping military aircraft and facilities for operation in the NAS, to the necessity for optimizing safety and using efficiently the air space of the world. This paper discusses the roles of the military, both as a user and operator of ATC systems and as a developer of ATC related systems and equipments. The different areas of the NAS in which interfaces exist between the civil and military are defined. These areas include operations, organizational interfaces, and equipment and facility interfaces and in many cases are covered by formal agreements. By way of illustration, two typical military flights are used to show the combined interaction of a military aircraft with both civil and military ground facilities. Communications, navigation, and surveillance requirements are discussed with respect to the various phases of the example flights. An indication of the future ground systems (military and civil) with which military aircraft might interact emphasizes the heavy burden placed on the airborne electronics systems. The paper finally suggests possible approaches that can be considered to ensure that the airborne equipment will not only be compatible with the various military, FAA, and ICAO ground environments in which the aircraft will function, but will also provide some basis for standardization and for efficient spectrum utilization."
        "This paper is designed as a survey document to be used as an overview and introduction to the various concepts and levels of complexity of current and future aids to air navigation. Major emphasis will be placed on identifying those technical and operational characteristics of each system concept and/or mechanization that have a significant impact upon both cockpit and ground-based communications and data processing. A representative bibliography is included to provide the reader the ability to pursue the subject further from an operational as well as a technical viewpoint. The object of this paper is to identify the relationship of air navigation aids to the flow and utilization of information in air navigation and air traffic control (ATC). Air navigation aids vary widely in both complexity and performance capability and these factors have a significant impact upon communications, data processing, and display, both in the air and on the ground."
"Three digital communications networks of the FAA performing essential services in support of the National Air Space System (NAS) are described and discussed. Designated as the Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunications Network (AFTN), the combined Weather Teletypewriter Networks A, C, and O, and the Service B Teletypewriter Network, respectively, these systems carry national and international digital message traffic in support of air traffic control operations and aeronautical weather services. These data are exchanged among the Air Traffic Control Centers, Airport Terminal Facilities, and Flight Service Stations of the FAA and in the case of weather data, with offices of the National Weather Service Military Weather and Flight Operations Offices, airlines, and other commercial and industrial interests. Recent and planned modernization programs resulting in the introduction of major computerized electronic message switching centers are also discussed. The electronic data processor configurations, their modes of operation, and specialized data handling features are described. Planned transition and progress to date in converting from 100 word/min teletypewriter operation to medium speed 1200-2400 Bd data rates and from manual inputs to the increasing use of computergenerated messages and computer-to-computer data exchanges are indicated. With the introduction of computerized switching and control centers the overall integration of FAA communications networks into a more fully unified total communications system with more standardized procedures and formats becomes more practical and achievable. Basic concepts and progress towards this goal are outlined."
"The ATC radar beacon system is a descendant, through an extended evolutionary development, of military identification friend or foe (IFF) systems begun during World War II. It is today's primary source of surveillance data for air traffic control and performs this function with a high degree of effectiveness. A number of programs are underway to correct its current deficiencies. Looking to the future, the further automation of air traffic control together with the projected growth of air traffic lead to requirements for improved surveillance and communication capability. A discreteaddress mode of beacon system operation, with integral ground-air-ground data link, is under development to meet these needs."
"An Airport Surface Traffic Control (ASTC) system is intended to expedite the safe movement of aircraft and vehicles on the airport surface (runways, taxiways, etc.). This paper describes the present ASTC system and discusses potential improvements in its surveillance function, with particular emphasis on multilateration techniques for aircraft/vehicle position determination and identification."
"A measure of discipline must be imposed on the groundbased interrogator complex if a new discrete-address beacon system is to be compatible when introduced into the present air traffic control system. It is postulated that this discipline, if imposed in a certain manner, will provide a surveillance system that will provide several additional benefits and services to the aircraft operator at minimum cost and complexity."
"EIRP enhancement and management techniques, emphasizing aeronautical communications and adaptable multibeam concepts, are classified and characterized. User requirement and demand characteristics that exploit the improvement available from each technique are identified, and the relative performance improvement of each is discussed. It is concluded that aeronautical satellite communications could benefit greatly by the employment of these techniques."
"Use of primary radars for air traffic control (ATC) is discussed. The location and the parameters of various ATC radars are described. The clutter environment (land clutter, birds, automobiles, and weather) has had a major impact on the configuration of these radars. Signal-processing techniques and antenna techniques utilized to cope with the clutter are described. Future signal-processing techniques for the ATC radars are postulated."
"The historical evolution and current status of the airborne traffic situation display concept is presented as well as a survey of related technological developments in collision-avoidance systems, area navigation equipment, and data links. Two alternative ATSD systems configurations are discussed: one deriving aircraft positions from ATC surveillance, the other deriving aircraft positions from air-to-air data exchanges. Based on the results of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology simulation study of airborne traffic situation display capabilities, a review of the many possible applications of the device is presented. Significant benefits in greater system capacity, greater safety, and an overall improvement in operational efficiency are predicted. A reduction in ATC capital and operating costs appears to be realizable if the ATSD is accepted as an integral element in future ATC system designs. Finally, the airborne computer-display capability required for the ATSD provides a fresh opportunity to combine, enhance, and integrate many of the cockpit functions that are now carried out by a proliferation of separate devices."
"Results of a flight test program involving a KC-135 jet airplane, the synchronous ATS-5L-band satellite, and a ground station are presented. Tests included over-ocean multipath measurements and one-way tone ranging within the 1545-1655 MHz frequency band. Amplitude characteristics, polarization, power spectral density, and selective fading properties were measured for sea-reflected and composite signal channels. CW tone-ranging performance was determined in both the thermal noise and multipath environments. Comparison of experimental results with theoretical expectation is given."
"Mobile satellite relay voice communications systems must provide high quality and reliable voice communications using relatively simple and inexpensive mobile equipment and easily achievable effective isotropic radiated power. High noise level reception will occur with analog voice communication systems operating over a power-limited link. At high noise levels, the low-level speech phonemes become masked by noise, which results in reduced speech intelligibility. In addition, a listener subjected over an extended period of time to this high noise level can become discomforted to the extent that his ability to understand what is being communicated is significantly reduced. An amplitude control technique has been employed for use with analog voice communication systems, which improves low-level phoneme reception and eliminates the received noise between words and syllables. Tests were conducted at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center on a narrow-band frequency-modulation simplex voice communication channel employing the amplitude control technique. Presented for both the modified rhyme word tests and the phonetically balanced word tests are a series of graphical plots of the tests' score distribution, mean, and standard deviation as a function of received carrier-to-noise power density ratio. At low received carrier-to-noise power density ratios, a significant improvement in the intelligibility was obtained. A voice intelligibility improvement of more than 2 dB was obtained for the modified rhyme test words, and a voice intelligibility improvement in excess of 4 dB was obtained for the phonetically balanced word tests."
"This paper examines the international arrangements and agreements for cooperative management of air-traffic systems and radio frequency assignments. It delineates and explains the roles of international organizations, both governmental and nongovernmental, which have an influence on the management of air traffic systems. It expands on the organization of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and gives examples of the manner in which international agreement has been reached on some of the systems used by civil aviation. It also outlines the steps involved in the international standardization of new systems."
"This paper surveys areas of communication technology that relate to civilian air traffic control system development from the present through the 1990's. A major portion of the paper consists of a series of examples that surveys communication analyses for the ATC systems. They support the need for the development of ATC radio channel models as an important prerequisite to the communications analysis of ATC systems."
"The implementation of new antenna techniques will contribute significantly to the success of air traffic control (ATC) and communication development programs. Three new antenna developments that incorporate advanced techniques are described, including an electronically scanned array for air traffic control radar beacon system (ATCRBS), a hybrid-scan array for aircraft/satellite communications at SHF, and a small antenna for aircraft/satellite communications at UHF."
"This paper provides an overview of the current airspace structure, describes some of the new concepts to be implemented over the next ten years, describes the expected airspace structure to be introduced in the 1980's, compares alternative control concepts, and estimates the air/ground data link requirements needed to support the traffic densities anticipated in the Los Angeles basin in 1995."
"Early attempts to provide a semblance of air traffic control were based on simple \"rules of the road\" resulting from the European sponsored International Convention for Air Navigation (1919). The United States formulated its first regulations relating to air traffic following the passage of the Air Commerce Act of 1926. By 1930, radio equipped airport traffic control towers were being established by some local (municipal) authorities. In 1933 instrument flying commenced, and by 1935 several airlines jointly established the first Airway Traffic Control centers to safeguard their aircraft against midair collisions. In 1936 this preliminary effort was transferred to the Federal Government, and the first-generation Air Traffic Control (ATC) System was born. This generation pioneered the development of ATC procedures, rules and regulations, the establishment of a nationwide ATC system for both civil and military air traffic, and certain new equipment and facilities. The advent of radar in the early 1950's marked the inauguration of the second-generation system, which carried on, expanded, and improved the accomplishments of the first generation, and brought into operational use radar and direct center/pilot communication capability. In the early 1960's the third generation came into being with the introduction of automation. Recognizing the need to develop a more comprehensive approach to solving the requirements of ever increasing air traffic volume, an upgraded third-generation system was postulated in 1969. The third/upgraded third generations will merge during the 1970's. From this base, the ATC System will transition to a fourth generation, which may be expected to be defined during the first half of the 1970's, with initial implementation commencing perhaps in the early 1980's."
"The functioning of the national air traffic management system is postulated using aircraft operating economies and mission flexibility as the primary goals. The management functions of enroute separation, sequencing for landing, and spacing of aircraft are discussed in an environment of near universal area navigation capability and rapid discreet communications."
"This paper considers the fundamental and pervasive role of communications in the operation of the current air traffic control system and in the planning of the advanced systems of the future. The authors discuss the evolution of the present system through its successive \"generations\" and present the major features of the proposed upgraded third-generation system, with emphasis on the communications requirements imposed by the elements of the upgraded third. Advanced systems concepts, both satellite and ground based, applicable to oceanic as well as continental service, are discussed. The overview concludes with a discussion of communications in relation to automation. The potential capacity of advanced system designs can best be realized by highly automated management."
"Computers, and digital techniques in general, have become pervasive in the technology of air traffic control (ATC). So much so that it is difficult to discover an area, application, or function in which automation is not involved, if only at the conceptual level. Rather than describing a single role for the computer, this paper examines some typical uses of computers in relation to the various functional organizations and facilities of the ATC system. One conclusion reached is that present and near-term computer teehnology is sufficiently capable to meet the needs of at least the next decade of air traffic. While the emphasis is not on machine organizations or computer sizings, several examples of each are presented to give perspective to the discussion."
"This paper provides a summary of the oceanic air traffic control problems and a description of the use of satellite technology that offers solutions to some of the problems. An outline of the current experimentation and evaluation programs is discussed together with the possible use of an international program for a dedicated aeronautical satellite system. Included is a brief system description of the proposed technical requirements for this system."
"One of the fundamental technical problems in aeronautical digital communications is that of multipath propagation between aircraft and ground terminal. This paper examines in detail a model of the received multipath signal that is useful for application of modern detection and estimation theories. The model treats arbitrary modulation and covers the selective and nonselective cases. The necessarily nonstationary statistics of the received signal are determined from the link geometry and the surface roughness parameters via a Kirchhoff solution. Use of the model in solving detection and estimation problems is outlined. Results of a flight experiment are presented and compared to a digital simulation for verification of the model."
 "Increased air traffic coupled with the proliferation of sophisticated avionics can be expected to stimulate increased demand for air traffic control (ATC) services over the next few decades. New challenges for the design of communication, surveillance, and navigation subsystems is an anticipated consequence. Since it is unlikely that significantly larger frequency bands will become available, it will be necessary to exploit more efficient multiple-access techniques. The design of a multiple-access technique for a particular application will depend on a broad range of system issues. A predetermined procedure based on general characteristics of the various techniques will have but limited value. An example of an ATC satellite surveillance system is used to illustrate some of the broad ranging systems issues that can be expected to influence the selection of the multiple access technique."
"This paper is concerned with characterizing the link between an airplane and a satellite. Attention is focused on the effect of indirect paths scattered from the surface of the earth. Applicable propagation-theoretic and system function-theoretic work is reviewed and integrated. Some new and some known expressions for channel correlation functions are presented for the \"steepest descent\" channel model."
"An exact analysis is carried out on the effects of noise and surface scatter multipath on the one-way ranging errors of a singlesideband tone ranging modem used in an airplane-satellite link. With appropriate redefinition of parameters the results are shown to apply approximately to double-sideband tone ranging modems at high signal/ noise and signal/multipath ratios. The theoretical results are applied to obtain numerical results on ranging error for typical system geometries and sea states and for a representative hemispherical-coverage aircraft antenna. Multipath is shown to cause larger ranging errors than previously indicated. The need for additional channel measurements is pointed out."
"The development of civil and related military air-ground communications in the United States is traced from its beginning in the late 1920's to the present time. The alternative methods of information exchange between the ground and aircraft, radar beacon transponders, and digital communications are reviewed from their conceptual identification to their current state of development. An estimate is made of the probability of implementation of the discrete address beacon system (DABS) and the RTCA endorsed universal data link."
"A historical background of instrumental approach and landing equipment for aircraft is given beginning with post-World War I efforts of J. D. Doolittle and emphasizing military-civil standardization efforts that began in 1948 and are continuing. The inadequacies of the current Instrument Landing System (ILS) are detailed and the various efforts of special committees to define an eventual replacement system are described. These committees include the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RCTA), Special Committee SC-117; the NATO Industrial Advisory Group (NIAG) Subgroup (SG-1); and the International Civil Aviation Organization, All Weather Panel (ICAOAWOP). A five-year national plan for development of a Microwave Landing System (MLS) is being carried out under the leadership of the FAA. The goals of the MLS program are stated and discussed. A number of the fundamental issues on system requirements and system design that were decided by the RTCA are described with their alternates. These issues include the use of air-derived data for extracting aircraft position data; the use of precision distance measuring equipment (DME); the requirement to provide flare-out guidance; and the establishment of a two-band approach using frequencies in theCand Kubands. An important issue not resolved was the selection of a technique for providing precision angular measurement of aircraft position. Two approaches are defined: scanning beam and Doppler technique. The basic configuration of a generic MLS is given to establish those functions that are common to both scanning beam and Doppler techniques. The two techniques are then compared in detail to show the advantages and disadvantages of each. The on-going MLS program has as a basic objective the resolution of this issue."

"This paper reports experimental measurements of limitcycle amplitude and period in digital recursive filters. The results that were obtained on two cascaded forms of a tenth-order filter show good agreement with existing theoretical bounds. (The bounds only apply to single second-order sections because analysis of cascaded sections is difficult.) Roundoff noise of the filter was measured and it agreed both in spectral shape and total power with that predicted by computer simulation. Some preliminary observations on relative magnitude of limit cycle and roundoff noise were made. In addition, the gradual buildup of a signal through a limit cycle was observed and 1 bit of noise in the least significant bit (LSB) in the filter was seen to break up limit cycles."
"This paper considers the use of majority logic decoding as a pseudonoise code acquisition technique. A bound on the probability of code acquisition is derived and it is shown that the probability of acquiring an 8191 code in one attempt can be made nearly one at -10-dB SNR."
"A hybrid digital transmission system of the kind originally proposed by Chang and Freeny [4], [6] is considered. Based on predictions about cable and repeater costs around 1980, an investigation of a certain economic measure of goodness is performed. Specifically, the influence on the system cost of the choice of certain fundamental system parameters like repeater spacing, symbol rate, and number of signal levels is studied."
"An investigation of interference between angle-modulated systems carrying multichannel telephony, which is directly applicable to existing satellite and terrestrial radio-relay systems, has been undertaken. This study includes a general solution for arbitrary narrow-band interference into an angle-modulated system with arbitrary modulation. The algorithm has been implemented on a digital computer to provide calculations of interference between two FDM/FM systems. The analysis is valid for all modulation indices, and may be applied to any PM, FM, or preemphasized FM baseband. A comparison of calculated results and experimental measurements shows good agreement. An extensive investigation, covering a wide range of modulation indices and basebands, has been conducted for the particular case of preemphasized FDM/FM signals. Wherever possible, a generalized presentation of interference results is given. Interleaving criteria are also presented for certain cases of interference involving two identical signals."
"The percentage of total power passed through ideal bandlimited channels with bandwidths equal to various multiples of the bit rate is examined for 14 unique binary baseband signaling schemes. The channel bandwidth required to pass 5 percent of the total power is determined as a measure of the need for near-dc channel response. Conclusions are reached as to which signals would be most suitable for high-rate magnetic tape recording."
"Two algorithms are proposed for recovering signals subjected to bandpass clipping and related types of nonlinear transformations. Both are based on contraction mapping principles and both seem to work experimentally, but neither has been validated formally. The conditions on signal determinism suggested by the algorithms have interesting practical implications."
"Recent extensions of information and communication theoretic concepts to simple systems involving a single transmitter and several receivers are described and compared in an intuitive and tutorial manner."
"Two quantization rules, optimum (minimum mean-square error) and logarithmic companding, are compared for application to digital speech transmission. Comparison is made on the basis of signal-to-quantizing noise ratio (S/N), subjective quality judgments, idle channel noise, and dynamic range. These quantizers are considered in both PCM and differential PCM configurations. A computer algorithm is described that yields the optimum quantizer levels for a given speech record. It has been found that the improvement in S/N which optimum quantization affords over conventional logarithmic quantization is offset by the greater idle channel noise and smaller dynamic range (range of talker volumes handled with a lower limit on S/N) of the optimum law."
"The issue of signal selection in binary data transmission is presented. The question of the relative utility of linear frequency sweeping (LFS or chirp), compared to PSK and FSK, in terms of error probability and spectrum usage, is discussed. The transmission media considered are the coherent, partially coherent, Rayleigh, and Rician channel models. Theoretically, LFS has unconditionally superior characteristics in the partially coherent and fading cases, for certain ranges of channel conditions. This is due to the more negative values of cross-coherence parameters possible with the LFS signal set over the FSK signal set. For the fading channel, theoretical supremacy of LFS over FSK depends upon the specular-to-Rayleigh signal power ratio and the adjustability of in-phase cross coherence, with a constraint upon quadrature phase cross coherence. From a practical standpoint, coherent reception of the LFS signal set has severe limitations. These are manifested primarily in two aspects: the need for phase synchronization of a chirp signal set, and the fact that the optimum value of cross coherence is highly sensitive to synchronization channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and/or spectral-to-Rayleigh signal power ratio. The latter would require that modulation characteristics track the channel conditions in order to achieve the supremacy in performance theoretically predicted by optimization of the cross-coherence parameter in LFS."
"This paper contains an examination of the performance of low bit rate differential PCM systems when used to encode monochrome National Television System Commission (NTSC) television pictures. 12 different encoders with various sampling rates and numbers of quantizing levels operating at bit rates from 9 to 24 Mb were considered. The differential PCM systems were implemented by using an 8-b PCM A/D converter followed by digital logic that performed the differential operation in a simple previous sample feedback loop. The subjective performance of these encoders was determined using an anchored seven-point quality rating scale and equipreference contours were plotted in a plane whose axes are sampling rate and quantizing bits. Entropy measurements were made on the output of the differential PCM encoders. These entropy measures were compared with the subjective performance of encoding systems operating at the same transmission rate. The encoding systems studied produced television pictures of medium quality in which quantizing noise and bandwidth limitations were apparent."
"A mathematical model for a general buffered telecommunication system with the output channel available only periodically is constructed and analyzed in this paper. Under the assumptions that certain system parameters are continuous variables, it is shown that the probability density functions for the peaks and valleys of the buffer content are exactly the same as the density functions for the response time and the waiting time, respectively, for aGI/G/1queuing system, with the density functions for the arrival processGIand the service processGobtained from the statistical functions for the parameters of the original buffered system."
"An approach to the analysis of performance of quasioptimum digital phase-locked loops (DPLL's) is presented. An expression for the characteristic function of the prior error in the state estimate is derived, and from this expression an infinite dimensional equation for the prior error variance is obtained. The prior errorvariance equation is a function of the communication system model and the DPLL gain and is independent of the method used to derive the DPLL gain. Two approximations are discussed for reducing the prior error-variance equation to finite dimension. The effectiveness of one approximation in analyzing DPLL performance is studied."
"In this correspondence we investigate the performance of several optimum and suboptimum devices for locating a sync word in data corrupted by Gaussian noise. One suboptimum synchronizer, which is extremely simple to instrument, is shown to perform virtually optimally over the entire range of interesting signal-to-noise ratios."
"This paper presents a study of traffic data collected at the telephone exchange (PABX) of The Norwegian Institute of Technology. A recording system primarily designed for accounting purposes [1] collects a set of data for each outgoing call and stores it on digital magnetic tape. Based on these data a statistical study is carried out emphasizing the properties of traffic sources, single subscriber sources, as well as groups of subscribers. After a survey of the system and the general traffic situation, studies of the call-generation process follow. Called number repertoires are treated, using the concept of entropy. The major part of the paper is devoted to the study of repeated calls. Comparisons are made with results from France and the U.S.A. An important scope of the paper is to point out the potentials of the applied method, implying the high efficiency of data collection as well as processing by means of computer techniques."
"The familiar error-correction codes allow a reduction in the required signal-to-noise ratio at the expense of an increase in bandwidth. Here we reverse the problem and investigate codes that permit a reduced bandwidth at the expense of an increase in the required signal-to-noise ratio. Theoretical properties of these bandwidth compaction codes have been published previously. This paper emphasizes the tradeoff between bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio when the codes are used. The inherent error detection and error correction properties of the codes are also explored."
"A model of nonlinear data wave regeneration without retiming is analyzed. Attention is focused on performance after regeneration and subsequent detection. The communication model consists of a pseudoternary signal that is regenerated at one data station, but not retimed prior to retransmission to another station. The signal regeneration is accomplished by a three-level slicer, and this nonlinear transformation degrades the overall system performance in the presence of noise. The extent of this degradation is our subject matter. The formulation and analysis are constructed so that one can put to effective use the fact that, for a certain Gaussian process, one can give definite expressions for the chance that its sample paths lie below a piecewise linear curve on an appropriately restricted time interval. We are able to use events of this type to give upper and lower bounds for the error rate. The bounds are compared with the error rate that would have been obtained had detection been accomplished before the nonlinear regeneration. We hope that the techniques employed here may be of use in other nonlinear communication problems."
"This paper is concerned with the problem of transmission errors in digitally encoded television signals. Various techniques for reducing the visibility of transmission error effects in the reconstructed signals have been evaluated using computer-produced film sequences. It is found that the visibility of errors in element difference coders is sharply reduced if an erroneous line is replaced by an average of adjacent lines. It is shown that the visibility of errors in two coders that use spatial prediction is low and can be further reduced by using a \"leaky\" predictor. The implications of these results for in-frame, interframe, and facsimile encoders are discussed."
"The new-word policy with decision feedback is shown to improve the efficiency of loop data communication with noisy links to the extent that the average number of loop transmissions per new word increases only linearly with the number of identically noisy links. This compares to an exponential increase in more conventional acknowledge-or-retransmit systems. Also, in the (almost) noiseless case, a greater number of word transfers per loop transmission can be achieved."
"In electronic data switching (EDS) exchanges through connection is performed according to the asychronous time-division multiplex principle. In an input code converter, a polarity reversal on a connected subscriber line or trunk is converted into a line address. With the aid of the central control/storage unit this line address is translated into the address of the serving line; via an output code converter a polarity reversal is effected on the respective line and transmitted to the receiving subscriber. The paper describes how the circuitry in the peripheral equipment of the EDS exchange can be reduced if on the trunks between the EDS exchanges line addresses are transmitted instead of single polarity reversals. To enable a good utilization of the transmission link, the addresses are intermediately stored in a parallel-serial converter and provided with an additional time address in order to recover the original instants at which the polarity reversals have occurred. The principle is illustrated by means of an example, and the possibilities of using PCM channels are outlined."
"This correspondence treats the derivation of natural moments from their corresponding Walsh characteristic function via the dyadic derivative operator. The derivation of a result concerning Walsh transforms of dyadic derivatives of functions is also considered. However, some established ideas such as Walsh transform, dyadic stationarity, and dyadic correlation are introduced first."
"The Lynch-Davisson (L-D) code is shown to be efficient for compressing line-scanned weather charts wherein each line is divided into equal-length segments, and a separate L-D code is generated for each segment. As the number of segments increases, the L-D code length decreases appreciably, thereby simplifying the encoding and decoding operations. However, the accompanying decrease in the overall compression ratio is relatively small."

"A model of a digital data message switching network is described. The network permits only finite storage at nodes. Discussed is a routing strategy and storage allocation to maximize throughput between many source-receiver pairs simultaneously."
"The grade of service of an alternate route is normally based on the average of several hourly blocking probabilities of the alternate route. The contemporary method for estimating the grade of service of an alternate route requires adjustment to the average traffic loads with appropriate correction factors in order to gain sufficient accuracy. This paper introduces the equivalent trunks technique, which can be used for approximating the alternate route grade of service without the need of adjustment to the average traffic loads. Thus, the technique is simple to use. In comparison with the results obtained by the present relatively complex method and the measured data, this technique is shown to give good accuracy. It is suggested that the preparation of engineering charts based on this technique would considerably further enhance the simplicity of its use for alternate route engineering."
"This paper describes a speech predictive encoding communications (SPEC) system that is designed to accommodate the traffic ofNPCM telephone trunks in the capacity ofN/2PCM telephone channels. The system exploits the statistics of multichannel voice communication in a manner significantly different from the technique employed in the well-known time-assignment speech interpolation (TASI) system. Specifically, the SPEC system operates at the transmitter by removing redundant speech samples during talk bursts as well as during silence intervals. The receiver remembers the most recent sample transmitted through each channel. As long as a new sample is not transmitted, the receiver simply repeats the sample value stored in its memory. Each sample from each incoming trunk is examined every 125 μs to determine which samples must be transmitted and which are redundant. Because the SPEC system operates at this high speed and predicts redundant or missing samples at the receiver, it does not produce the speech clipping effects typical of TASI-like systems. Any voice-quality degradation due to increased call load and/or speech activity is manifested as an increase in noise power. The subjective result is a graceful degradation that is virtually imperceptible to the listener."
"An improvement on Saltzberg's 1968 bound is presented."
"This paper describes a new method for analyzing the acquisition behavior of a second-order generalized tracking system in the absence of noise. In particular it allows closed-form expressions of the pull-in range and of the frequency acquisition time for any type of loop nonlinearity. The results of the present analysis are compared with those already known in the literature and with others obtained via the numerical solution of the system equation."
"An analytical formula for the amplitude density of an almost periodic single-tone amplitude-modulated (AM) waveform is presented along with an analytical procedure to obtain the amplitude density for a periodic single-tone AM signal."
"Certain properties of periodic signals are defined in terms of the zeros and singularities of associated analytic functions of a complex time variablez. This algebraic approach is a generalization of analytic signal theory, and leads to the conception of hybrid modulation as the superposition of twoz-plane zero-singularity (ZS) patterns associated with amplitude- and angle-modulating signals, respectively. It is shown that important spectral properties of the modulated signal, such as band limitation, are explicit in the resultant pattern. Signal design is then interpreted in terms of ZS manipulation and placement. The theory is applied in a unified approach to compatible singlesideband (CSSB) modulation systems. It is shown that two types of proposed CSSB systems give rise to essentially nonband-limited output signals. The relation between conventional and single-sideband (SSB) angle modulation is also discussed in terms of their characteristic ZS patterns."
"This paper investigates the problem of estimating the effects of interference to a coherent phase-shift-keyed (CPSK) digital carrier. Paralleling Saltzberg [1], the principal tool utilized is the CramérChernoff bounding technique. The interference effects can be characterized by equating the larger interferers to an equivalent coherent canceling sine wave and the remaining interferers to an equivalent incoherent source of thermal noise. Subject to an envelope constraint, any allocation of the interferers between a canceling sine wave and thermal noise is allowed. Conditions are developed for the case: 1) when all the interference should be allocated to thermal noise; and 2) when as much as possible of the interference should be allocated to a canceling sine wave. This provides insight into the formal procedure of equating interference as additional thermal noise."
"A new spread spectrum technique using band-limited Gaussian noise for transmission and incoherent detection at the receiver has been discussed. The proposed system called noise band shift keying (NBSK) may be considered as a modified form of the frequency-shift keying (FSK) system. In the NBSK system nonoverlapping bandlimited noise is transmitted instead of pure tones as in the FSK system and the center frequency of the noise is chosen on the basis of the binary data signal. For this system, an expression for the probability of error has been derived and it has been shown that its performance under nonfading channel conditions is identical to that of the FSK system with frequency diversity under Rayleigh fading conditions. Compared to the conventional spread spectrum systems, the proposed method is considerably more simple to implement and is attractive where adequate bandwidth is available."
"This paper derives the power spectrum of a modulating scheme under consideration by NASA for commanding scientific satellites. In this scheme the commands are frequency-shift keyed onto a subcarrier, then the clock is amplitude modulated onto the resultant. This PCM/FSK-AM waveform is then phase modulated onto a prime carrier. The method used in the paper can be easily extended to derive the spectrums of alternate command waveforms, such as PCM/FSK-AM/ FM, PCM/PSK-AM/PM, etc."
"Expressions for calculating the magnitudes and frequencies of jitter components due to the pulse stuffing process are derived by means of a Fourier transform of the pulse stuffing jitter waveform (PSJW) for the cases where the housekeeping bit does and does not affect the stuffed positions. Previously, the latter case has always been assumed. The difference between the two cases is a function of the multiplex format, the number of cells in the synchronizer store and the type of phase detector used. The effect of the housekeeping bit is to increase the number of jitter components in the frequency domain and the store size requirement for waiting time jitter. With a reasonably low desynchronizer bandwidth, the desynchronizer output jitter can be smaller than in the ideal case previously considered."
"Records obtained on a microwave relay system south of Lake Michigan indicate that significant attenuation can occur during rainfall at frequencies as low as 7-8 GHz. Prolonged outages axe possible when a squall line moves along, rather than across, a relay system."
"The computation of expected values of functions of quantized random variables is treated by sampling theory methods, as an extension of Widrow's work on the statistical theory of quantization. It is shown that such expected values can often be evaluated readily when conditions analogous to Nyquist sampling constraints are satisfied. An example-computation of the autocorrelation of a phase-quantized angle-modulated signal-is provided to illustrate the use of the theory. Other potential areas of application are suggested."
"The performance of a maximum likelihood receiver whose input is the photoelectric current created by a modulated light beam is studied for a number of discrete modulation schemes. The performance is compared with that of a classical microwave receiver, i.e., one designed to optimize detection in a Gaussian channel. Such a receiver has the advantages of availability, simplicity, ease of implementation, and greater tolerance to slow photodetector response and is an obvious candidate for suboptimum detection. Procedures for calculating receiver performance in the Poisson regime by the tilted probability density technique are described and applied specifically to modulation schemes employing one or more subcarriers that are biphase or quadriphase modulated. Results indicate that the classical receiver falls noticeably short of the optimum only at or near 100 percent modulation, where it may require at worst up to 30 percent more light power in order to equal the maximum likelihood receiver. When modulation is incomplete, or when background radiation is significant, the difference in performance is generally much smaller."

"A restriction on the type of phase-locked loop usable as a timing filter in digital regenerative repeaters is discussed. The limitation arises from the growth of random timing noise. It is shown that the use of second-order loops enables an improvement of less than 1 dB in noise bandwidth over the comparable first-order loop."
"The Bedrosian-Rice series method for calculating anglemodulation distortion is compared with the representative earlier method by Carson and Fry. The Bedrosian-Rice method is determined to be more attractive because the convergence properties are better, the calculations are simpler, and the series is more adaptable to the digital computer."
"Upper and lower bounds to probability of error in binary communication systems with intersymbol interference are presented. Closed-form formulas are given for systems with filters having a finite number of lumped elements. Explicit results are given when the filters are Butterworth filters of orderN = 1, 2,..., 10. Four systems are considered: with a sample detector (SD), with an integrate-integrated-and-dump detector (IDD), with a filter in receiver only, and with filters in receiver and transmitter. The transmitted signal is assumed to be of the nonreturn-nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) form."
"A conventional telephone network and the proposed IFS-1 integrated PCM system [1] differ in their hardware, software, and callrouting policies. IFS-1 has been designed with a measure of hardware and software compatibility with the conventional systems in use in Switzerland: an IFS-1 terminal accepts both analog channels and the full range of existing signalings. However, IFS-1's new network structure may mean costly changes in call routing within the still-conventional part of a mixed-type network as will exist during the introduction period. This paper describes how to put to advantage IFS-1's flexibility so as to avoid any change in the operation of conventional equipment, as well as any subscriber renumbering, due specifically to the introduction of PCM. It further describes a computer program package, developed for a preliminary study of the introduction of PCM into the district network of Berne, Switzerland, and which models the growth of a conventional network and its gradual transition to a fully integrated PCM network."
"The rapidly growing interest in loop communication systems is accompanied by an increasing need to improve their reliability and reduce their vulnerability. This paper analyzes the reliability of multistage loop networks. Analytical expressions for topologies exhibiting maximum availability are obtained in terms of key-component down-time ratios. These optimal topologies are expressed in terms of terminal connections per subloop and subloops per higher level loops. The availability performance of these optimal topologies is investigated. Finally, the availability improvement obtainable by going to higher stage loop networks is investigated."
"In a communications system the total system error is of importance. One measure of system error is the mean-square error between the input signal and the output signal. The total mean-squared error includes sampling error, quantization error, and channel error. The work reported here considers all three errors in differential pulsecode modulation (DPCM) systems and compares the results obtained with standard pulse-code modulation (PCM) systems. The total meansquared error is determined using well-defined system parameters such as quantizer levels, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), sampling rate, etc. Using the derived formulas the design of DPCM systems is facilitated along with various tradeoff studies. The error equations are determined for both uniform and nonuniform quantizers. The error due to channel noise is obtained in closed form for both cases. DPCM and PCM are compared for three different reconstruction filters, the zero-order hold (ZOH), the linear interpolator (LI), and the ZOH followed by a low-pass filter. The optimum prediction coefficient is shown to depend on the channel noise. The optimum prediction coefficient improves the performance of DPCM systems considerably. DPCM is shown to perform better than PCM in all cases. Simulation results are presented, which verify the theoretical results."
"This paper describes a procedure for a suboptimal routing of simultaneous multiterminal multicommodity flows in circuit switched communication networks. The procedure is based on a concept of topological importance of a branch in a capacitated net with a given structure and relative to a given pattern of communication requirements. Once these importance weights have been attached to the branches of the net, the problem reduces to finding in a weighted network the shortest path between two nodes. The chosen objective here is to optimize the grade of service (GS) by satisfying (on a long-range traffic policy basis) the changing \"call\" demands presented to the network, as fully as possible."
"This paper presents a short general survey of the integrated network problems. How digital techniques can provide new capabilities of transmission and switching of the information that could allow the progressive realization of a single universal network of telecommunications is examined."
"When the ratio of the frequency of the carrier to that of the modulating signal becomes less than approximately 10:1, AM detectors become unable to detect the impressed modulation in a satisfactory manner. Distortion due to transient charging and discharging phenomena in the diode circuit during detection of wide-band AM signals has imposed limitations on channel capacity in AM and FM wide-band multiplexing systems. This paper presents and analyzes polyphase envelope detection as a suitable method of solving the problem. This technique makes it possible to detect the envelope of the impressed AM signal to any desired degree of accuracy even when the ratio of the frequency of the carrier to that of the modulating signal approaches unity. The paper shows the results of an experiment that was carried out to verify the theory."
"The width of a train of square pulses can be varied to produce a modulated carrier at the pulse repetition frequency. When the pulse train is generated by switching (class D) transistors, highefficiency operation is possible. The efficiency of this type of amplifier can be significantly higher than that of conventional pulsewidth modulation amplifiers, since the switching rate is reduced. In addition, the spectrum of a bipolar pulse train so modulated has the highly desirable property of all spurious products being band limited near the odd harmonics of the carrier."
"The effect of a hard limiter on a quadrature PSK (QPSK) signal is determined for a sample detector and an integrate and dump detector. In the latter case theBTproduct is assumed to be infinite. The degradation due to hard limiting is approximately 1 dB."
"This paper presents the derivation of the recursive algorithms necessary for real-time digital detection ofM-ary known signals that are subject to independent multiplicative and additive Gaussian noises. The motivating application is minimum probability of error detection of digital data-link messages aboard civil aircraft in the earth reflection multipath environment. For each known signal, the detector contains one Kalman filter and one probability computer. The filters estimate the multipath disturbance. The estimates and the received signal drive the probability computers. Outputs of all the computers are compared in amplitude to give the signal decision. The practicality and usefulness of the detector are extensively discussed."
"In this paper a technique for setting the level in a levelcrossing detector is discussed. Experimental verification of this method is given along with measurements of receiver performance."
"The likelihood equation for the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of a temporal phase modulation (a sample function of a wide-sense stationary zero-mean Gaussian random process) received in a spatial aperture after transmission through a spatially turbulent channel and addition to a white Gaussian noise field is derived for unknown, Gaussian, and limiting cases of log-normal received signal fields. The received signal field estimation performed by the demodulator structure is explicitly exhibited and other clarifications made. The likelihood equation is linearized and solved and the resulting mean-square estimation error calculated. The Cramer-Rao lower bound is given. In an example it is shown that the linear estimate is efficient and has variance inversely proportional toM, the number of coherence areas required to disjunctly cover the receiver spatial aperture. A heterodyne receiver with an optimized aperture weighting is shown to use essentially only one coherence area; its asymptotic mean-square error is also calculated."
"A linear receiver for digital communication over unknown dispersive and noisy channels obtained by jointly optimizing the prefilter and equalizer has been described by the authors in a recent paper [4]. An extension to incorporating a decision-feedback equalizer is made. Performance of the new receiver is evaluated by means of computer simulation. Comparison of the performance of the new receiver, the matched filter-equalizer receiver, and the fixed low-pass filter-equalizer receiver is made both with respect to convergence rate and error rate. It is conjectured that the new receiver exhibits performance superior to both the matched filter-equalizer receiver and the fixed low-pass filter-equalizer receiver."
"Quadrature and demodulation phase errors in a quadrature PSK system cause crosstalk between channels. It is shown that the tracking loop signal-to-noise ratio must be at least 5 dB greater than for PSK to give the same performance."
"The probability of error is computed in four binary communication systems withNth order (N = 1, 2,...,10) Butterworth filters and split-phase signals. The systems have either a sampling detector or an integrating-and-dumping detector; the filter is either in the receiver only or both in the receiver and transmitter. A lower bound to the probability of error is also computed for modified binary communication systems in which prior to the decision the contribution of the past transmitted symbols is eliminated. In all systems the sampling time is optimized and the effect of nonoptimal sampling time on probability of error is demonstrated."
"This paper studies various iterative detection processes for use in a synchronous serial data-transmission system where the signalelements are transmitted in orthogonal groups. The methods of operation of the different detection processes are first described, and then results of computer simulation tests are presented to compare the tolerances of the detection processes to additive white Gaussian noise, for various values of the sampled impulse response of the channel. It is shown that a good tolerance to noise can be achieved by detection processes that do not require an excessive number of sequential operations or unduly complex equipment."

"Band-limited (BL) random-real-zero (RRZ) signals are a class of stationary stochastic processes whose zero crossings are the randomly perturbed zeros of a sinusoid. They are the only nontrivial examples known to date of band-limited signals whose correlation function and power spectrum can be computed exactly from a probabilistic description of their zeros. Such signals have optimal correlation characteristics, in the sense that their correlation function exhibits the maximum peak to sidelobe ratio attainable under a fixed bandwidth constraint."

"This paper presents results of an experiment in binary error estimation in near real time for quality-monitoring purposes. Received binary data transitions are processed to give upper and lower estimation bounds for the number of errors in a sample. These bounds are compared with the recorded number of errors."
"The planning of a digital radio network requires an evaluation of the effect of quite a large number of interfering sources. These in turn are dependent upon many parameters, such as the network structure, channel arrangement, antenna patterns, and so on. This paper presents a performance analysis of a digital radio-relay system during fading periods. The possibility of attaining a required fading margin is analyzed when many co-channel and interchannel interferences are simultaneously present, both for long-haul and shorthaul radio relay systems. A comparison is presented between two possible techniques for the reusing of the same frequency band in each hop, by taking advantage of the cross-polarization discrimination (XPD). The reduction of the XPD expected during fading periods is also taken into account. Binary and quaternary coherent PSK modulations are considered, with realizable filters (of the Butterworth type), both at the transmitter and at the receiver. The error probability calculations were performed with a combined analytical and computer simulation approach. The results seem to indicate the feasibility of the frequency reuse technique."
"System performance is determined for an optical communication system using noncoherent detection in the presence of tracking error induced signal fading assuming 1) binary on-off modulation (OOK) with both fixed and adaptive threshold receivers, and 2) binary polarization modulation (BPM). BPM is shown to maintain its inherent 2-3 dB advantage over OOK when adaptive thresholding is used, and to have a substantially greater advantage when the OOK system is restricted to a fixed decision threshold."
"Probability distribution of a timing-wave envelope level in a regenerative repeater, which transmits a random binary sequence, is analyzed. The result obtained is that the probability of timing information disappearance in a repeated line can be disregarded compared with that of failure of a repeater."
"An expression for the error probability of multilevel coherent phase-shift-keyed (CPSK) systems in the presence of intersymbol, interchannel, and co-channel interferences and additive Gaussian noise is derived. An exact expression is given for the binary CPSK system, whereas upper and lower bounds are presented for the multilevel systems. The approach proposed in this paper overcomes the difficulties of the exhaustive methods and allows accurate and fast evaluation of the character error probability. Only the impulse responses of the overall channels are needed, and the computational labor is reduced to the numerical evaluation of one particular type of integral, whose computation is based upon nonclassical Gaussian quadrature rules. The model of the system is general enough to allow the choice of a rectangular or otherwise-shaped modulating pulse and a constant or shaped envelope of the modulating carrier. Phase incoherence between adjacent carriers is also assumed, and a random misalignment among the modulating bit streams can be taken into account, if necessary. Extensive numerical results are presented for 2- and 4-level systems. The presentation of the results stresses a possible utilization of them in system design problems."
"The Linear Prediction Vocoder (LIPREDER) System is an analysis-synthesis speech processing system which efficiently converts speech into digital form at voiceband data rates. The objective of our study was to optimize the LIPREDER system in terms of performance and complexity for a wide selection of talkers and sentences at data rates of 3600 and 7200 b/s. The optimized LIPREDER system produces synthetic speech quality which represents a substantial improvement over previous voice encoders operating at voiceband data rates. Evaluation results indicate that for most talkers and text there is little or no perceptible quality difference between the synthetic speech produced by LIPREDER systems at 3600 and 7200 b/s. Additionally, implementation of the LIPREDER system appears to be technically feasible."
"The probability of error in a binary signal owing to intersymbol interference and Gaussian noise is computed by approximation of the expression for the probability of error by a finite sum of squareintegrable functions. The approximating functions should be chosen so that their averages over all bit combinations can be easily determined. The projection of the error function on the subspace of polynomials results in a series which converges more rapidly to the exact error rate than does the Taylor series expansion used previously. The negative exponential functions have the same general form as the error function and, as expected, also result in rapid convergence to the average error rate."
"A first-order phase-locked loop with detuning is considered in the presence of white Gaussian noise and random amplitude impulsive noise with Poisson times. The stochastic equation for the phase error density is of infinite order, but when the stationary mod-2π phase density is represented by a Fourier series, a linear second-order difference equation is the Fourier coefficients results. The difference equation is solved numerically, and the phase error density is generated from the Fourier series. This method uses no approximations and is valid for any impulsive amplitude probability density."
"Signal-to-noise ratios (SNR's) at the output of the squarelaw detector are determined as the functions of modulation degree and bandwidth ratio of the modulating signal and the noise carrier, when the input is an amplitude-modulated noise carrier."
"The optimum deviation ratio (h =1/2) and observation interval (2-b periods) for a continuous-phase binary frequency-shift keying (CPBFSK) signal have been determined analytically for particular length sequences based on a squared-distance criterion."
"In order to investigate overload control strategies for large electronic switching systems (ESS), it is extremely valuable to be able to load test actual switching machines in a controlled laboratory environment. This method is superior when compared to both testing actual machines in service (where service deterioration cannot be tolerated) and simulating test of virtual machines (where sufficient realism may not be attainable). In the past, this form of experimentation has not been feasible for large ESS's because of both technical and economic problems associated with existing methods of generating the high volume of traffic required for overload testing. With the advent of the real-time traffic simulator known as the programmed electronic traffic simulator (PETS), however, it has become practical to conduct real-time tests of on-line overload control systems. PETS has been utilized to perform overload control experiments on an ESS to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting controlledenvironment overload testing on an actual ESS. It is the intent of this paper to describe the methodology used in the simulation experiments conducted and summarize some of the simulation results. In particular, the results of the three overload control systems will be compared with respect to both the total number of calls completed within a specified period of time and the grade of service provided. The sensitivity of system performance to the peakedness factor of the offered traffic will also be presented."
"A bit-synchronization method in a frequency-shift-keying (FSK) data channel has been investigated experimentally and results are presented. The bit-timing information is conveyed by a square wave, with a frequency of half the data bit rate, modulated onto the signal amplitude. It has been shown that for a system using a peak-peak-to-peak frequency deviation of 0.7 times the bit rate and a receiver bandwidth restricted to 1 times the bit rate, the minimum error rates are obtained for an amplitude modulation index of 0.1. Further, in order for the system to have a performance comparable with an ordinary FSK system with the same values of frequency deviation and receiver predetection bandwidth and with perfect timing available at the receiver, an additional signal power of 0.9 dB is needed."
"The performance in estimating a Wiener process that modulates the phase of a subcarrier in a direct-detection optical communication system is studied. An approximation is derived for the steady-state probability density of the estimation error. The meansquare estimation error predicted using this density is compared to theoretical lower bounds on the error and to the sample meansquare error obtained by simulation."
"The simple partitioned Markov chain model is used to evaluate the effectiveness of burst error correcting codes. A Massey diffuse convolutional code is analyzed as an example to illustrate the method. Calculated results and simulation results are presented."
"A recursive nonlinear equalizer has been developed. The Bayes estimation theory has been used to obtain an unrealizable nonlinear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) receiver for the reception of binary pulse-amplitude-modulation signals in the presence of intersymbol interference and noise. A realizable approximation to the Bayes structure has been derived as the combination of a matched filter and a nonlinear recursive equalizer structure. The equalizer has been made adaptive using a new algorithm that defines and maintains the time frame of reference and is constrained so that the equalizer's parameters always move toward their optimum values. Computer simulations have been used to demonstrate the properties of the estimate feedback equalizer (EFE) and to compare its performance to that of presently known equalizers."
"In an experimental Study on anesthetized mongrel dogs, the current levels of dc and 20-Hz ac, both singly and in combination, necessary to evoke ventricular fibrillation were investigated. The following shock durations were investigated: for dc; 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 2000 ms, for 20-Hz ac; 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 2000 ms, and for combination dc and ac shocks; 200, 500, 1000, and 2000 ms. It is shown that threshold fibrillating currents of a given shock duration and type are apparently more nearly log normally than normally distributed. The tests of linear combinations of ac and dc resulted in the following working principles. The hazard of any shock of whatever combination of ac and dc is essentially the same as that of a pure ac shock of 1) the same duration and peak-to-peak current if the shock duration is 0.5 s or longer, or 2) the same peak current if the duration is 0.2 s (and possibly shorter)."
"The present structure of adaptive least mean-square error (LMSE) equalizers for data transmission has an unnecessary constraint of a fixed position for the reference tap. This constraint limits their performance. In this paper a gradient-directed method of adjusting the position of the reference tap is developed to minimize the mean-square distortion (MSD). A scheme for implementing this modified equalizer is proposed. Results of computer simulation are shown that indicate that for channels with delay distortion some improvement in performance can be achieved."

   "The necessity of filtering noisy data generated by multidimensional processes arises in many diverse settings. The direct application of the Kalman-Bucy results is hindered by dimensionality difficulties inherent in multidimensional problems. This paper shows that for linear steady-state problems significant dimensionality reductions can be accomplished, thus making routine the solution of many interesting problems."

"Linear stochastic systems with convex performance criteria and convex, compact control regions are studied. The admissible control region is assumed to be a continuous function of the (perfectly) observed state. Optimal feedback controls are shown to exist within the class of Borel measurable functions of past states. In fact, they are shown to be continuous functions of the present state. Using dynamic programming the optimal return function is shown to be convex. Asymptotic results for stable systems are derived. These results are then used to explore several problems in aggregate production and work-force planning. Computational aspects of the results in the context of the smoothing problem are discussed."

"Necessary and sufficient conditions for decoupling linear multivariable systems using output feedback are determined. For a system which satisfies these conditions, the class of all feedback matrices which decouple the system is characterized. These conditions provide realistic criteria for determining if a compensator or an observer is required for decoupling."
"The general question of compensating a linear multivariable system via linear state variable feedback (lsvf) in combination with input dynamics is considered. In particular, it is shown that, since lsvf and input dynamics can both be represented by proper feedforward compensation, any design based on feedforward compensation alone can usually be realized in a more efficient manner through the combined use of \"low-order\" feedforward compensation (input dynamics) and lsvf. A major result of this paper is the frequency-domain synthesis algorithm outlined in Section III for \"separating\" any proper feedforward transfer matrix in order to achieve the more efficient compensation scheme. Specific examples which illustrate the employment of the algorithm to the questions of decoupling and exact model matching are also included."
"A technique for modeling linear time-varying differential systems by linear time-invariant systems of lower order is discussed and criteria for determining stability, uniqueness, and the choice of the model of a given dimension are developed. In addition, a lower bound for the minimized performance index is derived and the effect on it of decreasing the dimension of the model is demonstrated."
"A new method for determining a minimal realization of a finite-dimensional linear system from data comprising a set of Markov parameters is presented. The method is based on treating the Markov parameter matrices as the elements of vectors in an inner product space. The novel feature of this approach is the explicit determination of the minimal polynomial Known algorithms [3], [5] may then be used to get a minimal realization."

"A general inner-minor transformation is presented. This transformation is based on a permutation matrix which preserves the determinants values of the corresponding inners and minors. Furthermore, for the root clustering problem, this permutation matrix takes a special simple form which preserves a certain feature in the innerwise matrix. For the sake of unification, it is shown in an example that the inner form is the unifying form."
"An algorithm, based on recent papers by Davison and Chatterjee [1], [2], is given which allows pole assignment to be carried out on large linear time-invariant multivariable systems with output feedback. A numerical example of 41st order is given to demonstrate the feasibility of the algorithm."
  "The theory of observer-estimators for linear discrete-time systems is described. Both deterministic and stochastic cases are considered; in particular, the case that some observations are noise free while others are noisy is considered. Asymptotic properties for both time-varying and time-invariant systems are analyzed and the influence of observability and detectability assumptions is considered. The results unify approaches to deterministic and stochastic state estimation problems for linear discrete-time systems. Optimal filtering in the presence of colored noise is considered as a special case."
"Some recent developments in the applications of matrices to problems arising in linear systems theory are described. It is shown how companion form matrices can be used to provide a unified framework for dealing with the qualitative analysis of polynomials, including such problems as determination of greatest common divisors. Relationships to classical theorems involving bigradients and to controllability are discussed. When applied to the determinantal stability criteria of Hurwitz and others, the companion matrix approach results in minors of half the original orders. The problem of minimal realization of a transfer function matrix is dealt with in terms of polynomial matrices using methods due to Rosenbrock, and links with the results on scalar polynomials are demonstrated. Some applications of Lyapunov theory to systems in state-space form are briefly reviewed."

"An exact graphical method is presented for the study of free and forced limit cycles in on-off control systems. This approach overcomes certain difficulties which arise when the Tsypkin-Hamel theory is applied to systems whose relay characteristics include dead zone or dissymmetry. The limit-cycle operation is determined from the intersection of characteristic curves, a construction which makes it possible to visualize separately the influence of the following: 1) the relay characteristic; 2) the dynamics of the linear system part; and 3) the wave shape of an external periodic forcing signal. Among other applications, the present method is very convenient for the analysis and design of switching-type power circuitry, and one such circuit is analyzed as an example problem."
"It is shown that, for any linear time-invariant multivariable system which is both completely controllable and completely observable, almost all output feedback laws can be used to make the closed-loop system have distinct poles; i.e., the set of output feedback laws which fails to achieve this goal is either an empty set or a hypersurface in the parameter space. It is also shown that almost any output feedback law will make the closed-loop system's poles be disjoint from any given finite set of points on the complex plane. It is then shown that any controllable observable system can be made controllable and observable with respect to any nontrivial input and output by applying almost all output feedback laws about the original system. These results have immediate application in pole assignment, in the controllability of parallel-connected systems, and in the identification problem. In addition, it is shown that, for any linear system and for almost all state feedback laws, the closed-loop system has the property that all modes of the system, except possibly those corresponding to the uncontrollable-unobservable part of the system, are observed in the output."

A frequency domain approach is followed in order to establish a general condition, which, in the particular case of single-input systems, admits a simple geometric interpretation. Connections with high frequency and slowly varying periodic control problems are also pointed out."

    "A new approach is presented for the problem of stochastic control of nonlinear systems. It is well known that, except for the linear-quadratic problem, the optimal stochastic controller cannot be obtained in practice. In general it is the curse of dimensionality that makes the strict application of the principle of optimality infeasible. The two subproblems of stochastic control, estimation and control proper, are, except for the linear-quadratic case, intercoupled. As pointed out by Feldbaum, in addition to its effects on the state of the system, the control also affects the estimation performance. In this paper, the control problem is formulated such that this dual property of the control appears explicitly. The resulting control sequence exhibits the closed-loop property, i.e., it takes into account the past observations and also the future observation program. Thus, in addition to being adaptive, this control also plans its future learning according to the control objective. Some preliminary simulation results illustrate these properties of the control."
  "The problem of optimal feedback control of uncertain discrete-time dynamic systems is considered where the uncertain quantities do not have a stochastic description but instead are known to belong to given sets. The problem is converted to a sequential minimax problem and dynamic programming is suggested as a general method for its solution. The notion of a sufficiently informative function, which parallels the notion of a sufficient statistic of stochastic optimal control, is introduced, and conditions under which the optimal controller decomposes into an estimator and an actuator are identified. A limited class of problems for which this decomposition simplifies the computation and implementation of the optimal controller is delineated."
"A new method is presented for controlling a discrete-time linear system with possibly time-varying random parameters in the presence of input and output noise. The cost is assumed to be quadratic in the state and control. Previous algorithms for the above problem when the system had both zeros and poles unknown were of the open-loop feedback type, i.e., they did not take into account that future observations will be made. Therefore, even though these schemes were adaptive, their learning was \"accidental.\" In contrast to this, the new approach uses an expression of the optimal cost-to-go that exhibits the dual purpose of the control, i.e., learning and control. The effect of the present control on the future estimation (\"learning\") appears explicitly in the cost used in the stochastic dynamic programming equation. The resulting sequence of controls, which is of the closed-loop type, is shown via simulations to appropriately divide its energy between the learning and the control purposes. Therefore, this control is called actively adaptive because it regulates the speed and amount of learning as required by the performance index. The simulations on a third-order system with six unknown parameters also demonstrate the computational feasibility of the proposed algorithm."
"The mathematical basis for tracking an ensemble of dynamically independent scatterers is presented. The scatterers need not be resolvable by the observing radar and may be arbitrarily numerous. A finite state representation is established for the ensemble by associating with it an oriented abstract object, for which input-output-state relations are derived and shown to have the response separation property. Reducibility of the derived state representation is examined. Special cases of practical importance, in which system reduction is possible, are developed in detail. An example illustrating the new tracking approach is presented, using a simulated one-dimensional scatterer ensemble."

"A four-level technique is described for estimation of aerodynamic moment coefficient Mα, normal acceleration force coefficient Zα, and velocityV. These parameters are associated with a simplified model of pitch plane dynamics for a tactical missile. Contrary to past studies where aerodynamic parameters were estimated from measurements which are very difficult to obtain (e.g., angle of attack), it is shown herein how estimates of the above parameters can be realized from measurements which are more easily obtained. Specifically, parameters are estimated from measurements of rate, normal acceleration, and gimbal angle deflection."
"Static optimization techniques have been used by the electric power industry for several years to solve the problem of economic load allocation. Experience has shown that difficulties frequently arise when these solutions are incorporated in the feedback control of dynamic electric power networks. In a recent paper, economic load allocation was formulated as a dynamic optimal control problem in an effort to overcome the disadvantages of controllers currently used. At the heart of that problem is the area control problem that is treated in detail in this paper. An unusual feature of the area control problem is that it contains kinks. The maximal principle is modified for this situation. Necessary conditions for an optimal controller are obtained for the general case ofngenerators. The optimal feedback controller is synthesized for the case of two-generator load sharing."

The applicability of the theory to the analysis of linear least squares vector estimation problem is demonstrated."
"A dynamic programming approach is used to obtain feedback solutions to a game problem involving linear systems having a time delay. As is known, the optimal feedback gains in linear time delay systems with quadratic criterion are determined by partial differential equations [1]. In the particular case studied here, the solution to these equations can be obtained by first separating variables and then solving the resulting simpler equations. The optimal feedback control also has the advantage that it can be realized on-line."

"It is established that the controllability of a linear time-variable delay differential system is implied by the algebraic criterion for controllability of the same system without delay, and by the controllability of its subsystems."
 "Quite often in a game there is not a strict conflict of interest among the players and they may agree to cooperate and help one another. In such cases, a solution that is Pareto optimal is attractive since it has the property that if any other solution is used at least one player does worse, or they all do the same. The same solution concept also applies to minimization problems with several cost criteria rather than a single scalar performance index. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for Pareto-optimal solutions of static, continuous problems. An example is presented to illustrate the theory."
"The concept of Pareto optimality and the concept of max-inf condition are used to give a new definition of optimality for a coalition of players. A necessary condition and a sufficient condition are proven for a class of topological games by using the approach of the theory of reachability for perturbed systems."
"Two stochastic optimal control problems are solved whose performance criteria are the expected values of exponential functions of quadratic forms. The optimal controller is linear in both cases but depends upon the covariance matrix of the additive process noise so that the certainty equivalence principle does not hold. The controllers are shown to be equivalent to those obtained by solving a cooperative and a noncooperative quadratic (differential) game, and this leads to some interesting interpretations and observations. Finally, some stability properties of the asymptotic controllers are discussed."

       "This correspondence is focused on the connection between a structural system property, such as the parameter insensitivity of state or output trajectories, and the accuracy achievable in the identification procedure. A geometric approach is used to synthesize, whenever possible, a controller, such that the Cramer-Rao lower bound of the parameter covariance function for the overall system is structurally not finite, i.e., for any input signal. This feature might be useful in connection with some evasion strategy problems and differential games."

It is shown that a generalized notion of detectability plays an important role in classifying solutions of these equations. This concept is also related to a minimum phase condition."
  "A new algorithm for the design of linear multivariable systems is presented. This algorithm constructs a set of minimal-order (McMillan degree) solutions to a proper rational matrix equation. The algorithm has direct application in exact model matching, inverse systems, and dynamic observers. In particular, application of the algorithm is made to the construction of a minimal-order inverse system."
 "TheH-matrix representation of the input/output behavior of an asymptotically stable constant parameter linear system is discussed. The concept of a canonical representation and the measurements required to determine this representation directly are treated. The minimal complete realization problem is solved for theH-matrix representation based on exponential signals, and connections between this approach and the identification and realization theories based on the Hankel matrix of Markov parameters are exhibited."
"The problem of finding frequency-domain conditions that are sufficient to ensure asymptotic stability with probability one (ASWP 1) of a Lure-type system with white-noise input disturbance is considered. It is shown that, if the noise is linearly related to the state of the system, a relatively simple frequency-domain inequality that guarantees ASWP 1 of the system exists. The stochastic version of the second method of Lyapunov, along with a Meyer-Kalman-Yakubovich(MKY)-type lemma, is used to derive such a condition, assuming first that only sector information of the nonlinearity is available. A modification of this lemma is subsequently used to derive an improved stability condition, assuming that both sector and slope information of the nonlinearity are available. Finally, the case of a differential system with white-noise parameter perturbation is considered and an illustrative example is presented."
"An adaptive approach for terminal feedback control of nonlinear systems with time-varying parameters is presented. Viability of the approach is established with simultation results and comparisons to existing approaches."
"A fixed final time free end-point optimal problem with a small time delay is considered. This problem leads to a nonlinear boundary-value problem consisting of both advanced- and retarded-type differential-difference equations. An asymptotic power series solution to the problem is constructed in terms of time delay. This asymptotic approximation procedure is aimed at improving a \"nominal design\" in which the small time delay is neglected. A scalar example illustrates the construction of asymptotic expansions. Numericai results on a coupled-core nuclear-reactor power control problem clearly show the advantages of the method."
"A decentralized stochastic optimal control problem is considered where agents have different a priori information on the system initial state. Agents are assumed to exchange their control values but not their state vector observation values. It is shown that this leads to a suboptimal control law, with correction terms being added to the well-known optimal proportional feedback control signal obtainable under the information centralization assumption of linear dynamics with quadratic cost, when person-by-person satisfactory team decisions are considered."
"The stability requirement for one-dimensional recursive filters is well known. A stability theorem forn-dimensional recursive filters is proved wherein the denominator of the filter is ann-dimensional power series. A Tauberian theorem due to Wiener yields the desired result in the general case."
"A new algorithm is presented to obtain the Luenberger canonical form for multivariable systems. A distinct feature of the method is that the canonical form is obtained directly and, if necessary, the similarity transformation can be computed. There is a substantial reduction in the amount of computation compared to Luenberger's method. The reduced computations along with Gaussian techniques lend greater inherent accuracy and the ability to refine the solution with additional computations. An example is presented to illustrate the technique."
"The extent to which the state vector information can be recovered in a decentralized control system from a partial observation record of the state vector measurement and also of the control vectors is discussed. That subspaces associated with partial reconstruction of the state space can be obtained recursively and that they have certain invariance properties is shown."
"This paper considersn-input,n-output convolution feedback systems characterized byy = G \\astr eande = u - Fy, where the open-loop transfer function\\hat{G}contains a finite number of unstable multiple poles andFis a constant nonsingular matrix. Theorem 1 gives necessary and sufficient conditions for stability. A basic device is the following: the principal part of the Laurent expansion of\\hat{G}at the unstable poles is factored as a ratio of two right-coprime polynomial matrices. There are two necessary and sufficient conditions: the first is the usual infimum one, and the second is required to prevent the closed-loop transfer function from being unbounded in some small neighborhood of each open-loop unstable pole. The latter condition is given an interpretation in concepts of McMillan degree theory. The modification of the theorem for the discrete-time case is immediate."
"A simple and elegant method for widening the domain of stability of nonlinear sampled-data systems to an appreciable extent is presented. The order of the difference equation is artificially increased in order to examine the behavior of the system in the time domain for a longer duration than indicated by the dynamics of the system. The utility of some of the well-known methods can be considerably enhanced by the technique described here. The method is illustrated by several examples, some of which are difficult to solve by the existing methods."
"It is shown that the method of [1] when applied to the Hankel matrix constructed from moments, in place of Markov parameters, for the case of symmetric transfer-function matrix also results in reciprocal realizations."
"Known results on dynamic feedback controllers for linear systems with unknown disturbances are extended to cases where the disturbances satisfy differential equations with arbitrary characteristic roots and where the state is not directly available for measurement. An observability test for existence of the controller and relations for its dynamic order are presented."
"Most minimal realization procedures utilize the Hankel matrix or properties of the controllability matrix. Recently a useful algorithm for obtaining minimal realizations has been developed by Rosenbrock using the system theory developed by him. This note shows that the algorithm can be simply developed using the properties of similarity transformation and matrix reduction procedures."
"A stochastic control problem over an infinite horizon which involves a linear system and a convex cost functional is analyzed. We prove the convergence of the dynamic programming algorithm associated with the problem, and we show the existence of a stationary Borel measurable optimal control law. The approach used illustrates how results on infinite time reachability [1] can be used for the analysis of dynamic programming algorithms over an infinite horizon subject to state constraints."
"Pontryagin's results on optimal parameter selection problems [1, p. 193] have been found to contain some errors, as reported in Boltyanskii [2, p. 263] and Hofer and Sagirow [4]. In this note, it is shown that Boltyanskii's results (on optimal parameters) are easily derived from Gamkrelidze's general maximum principle [3], which, in contrast to the former, also yields an explicit solution to the problem in certain special cases."
"Necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimization of multivariable discrete systems containing pure delays in dynamics, in performance index, and in constraints are investigated. Using nonlinear programming, it is shown that a discrete maximum principle similar to the one derived by Pearson and Sridhar [1] is valid for a subclass of these problems, that is, systems with linear dynamics, convex inequality constraints, and convex performance index."
"An algorithm for computing optimal controls for a class of continuous-time stochastic systems is presented. For a linear example, it is shown that the generated control is precisely the optimal control. Numerical results for a nonlinear example suggest that the generated control is at least locally optimal."

"The demand for improved dynamic response of fossil-fired power plants has motivated a comprehensive program of control system design and analysis. Previous papers have reported the development of a nonlinear mathematical model of a drum-type, twin furnace, reheat boiler-turbine-generator (RBTG) system which is suitable for control system analysis and has been extensively verified by field test. On the basis of this model, local stability, observability, and controllability have been examined over the load range, using linearization and modal analysis. An approach to control system design has been developed based on optimal linear regulator theory and which recognizes the limitation of an imperfect model. This approach produces \"integral-type\" action which guarantees zero steady-state errors. The controller does not require complete state feedback. Improved performance has been demonstrated by comparison with the existing control structure through simulation using the nonlinear process model."
"For a stochastic control system with noisy observations, some interest has been shown in mechanizing the optimal open-loop control law as a suboptimal feedback control law. Examples have appeared in the literature to show that the performance of this feedback control law is better than the performance of the optimal control function without feedback. It is shown here that in general this unproven observation is true."

"This paper is the first in a series of three, the remaining two of which will appear at a later date. Performance bounds are derived in this series of papers for causal state estimation and regulation problems employing mean-square criteria. The systems considered are partially observed finite-dimensional continuous-time stochastic processes driven by additive white Gaussian noise. The particular systems to which the bounds apply are those which, when modeled by Ito differential equations, contain drift (.dt) coefficients which are, to within a uniformly Lipschitz residual, jointly linear in the system state and externally applied control. The bounds derived in the complete series of papers include both upper and lower bounds for causal state estimation and for a quadratic regulator problem. The upper bounds pertain to the performance of some simple, almost linear designs reminiscent of the designs which are optimal in the linear case. The lower bounds pertain to the optimum performance attainable within a broad class of candidate designs. This paper treats the upper bound for estimation. The second paper presents the estimation lower bound. The estimation performance bounds are independent of the control law, giving a particularly simple form to the control performance bounds which are developed in the third, and final, paper. All the bounds converge with vanishing nonlinearity (vanishing Lipschitz constants) to the known optimum performance for the limiting linear system. Consequently, the bounds are asymptotically tight and the simple designs studied are asymptotically optimal with vanishing nonlinearity."
 "The development of on-ramp metering control strategies for a freeway can be aided by the well-developed theory of linear optimal control. However, an adequate model of an appropriate form must be available. Recently developed \"aggregate variable\" models appear to be best suited to this purpose. In these models the freeway is sectioned into lengths of about\\frac{1}{2}mi and traffic is described in terms of the aggregate variables section speed, section density, and volume. The model is used to formulate a linear regulator problem with quadratic cost for the purpose of determining a feedback control rule which returns the freeway to nominal conditions after a disturbance. The solution of the regulator problem involves considerable computation difficulty when the order of the system is large. In a large class of applications the optimal control law has a local structure which can be exploited in a computationally efficient manner to yield a suboptimal control with little loss of system performance. A new technique, the augmentation method, is presented for constructing a suboptimal control from a set of optimal controls for low-order sub-systems. New results are presented which provide a rational and elegant measure for the additional cost associated with an arbitrary stabilizing suboptimal control. Additional results pertain especially to the augmentation procedure. The models and suboptimal control scheme are applied to a specific detailed design for an 8-mi segment of the San Diego Freeway in Los Angeles. Simulations are shown illustrating the effectiveness of such traffic-responsive controls in clearing up congestion due to traffic incidents."
"The application of learning theory to on-line optimization of unknown or poorly defined plants is discussed. An on-line optimization procedure is achieved by means of a learning algorithm which alters a trainable controller on the basis of an instantaneous performance criterion or subgoal. The subgoal is related to the over-all goal, the integral cost, by means of successive approximations to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The resulting piecewise linear controller is implemented by means of an encoder consisting of threshold logic units and a classifier consisting of a set of logic switching functions. The classifier is determined by means of an algorithm developed by Arkadev and Braverman. Features of the learning algorithm are illustrated by minimum-time and minimum-time-fuel problems."
"The armature copper losses of an externally excited dc motor are analyzed for a digital control system comprising the motor, an amplifier, a reversible counter (used as phase comparator), and converters (D/A and A/D). The open- and closed-loop cases are analyzed, and the linear system gain is calculated for a given form factor. The minimal number of stages required for a given form factor and speed interval by use of nonlinear gain are also determined. The analysis is illustrated for a 10-kW motor, including the voltage and current waveforms (verified theoretically and experimentally) and the graphical relationship between the counter length (number of stages) and the form factor."
"Controllability of time-invariant discrete-time bilinear systems is discussed. Bilinear systems are classified into two categories: homogeneous and inhomogeneous. Sufficient conditions which ensure the global controllability of discrete-time bilinear systems are obtained by localized analysis in control variables."
"An optimal control problem with linear dynamics and quadratic criterion is imbedded in a family of problems characterized by both initial and terminal points. The optimal value function is jointly quadratic in initial and terminal points, and the optimal control is jointly linear. Recursive formulas for the coefficients of these functions are developed. This generalized procedure can be used to solve several versions of the problem not solvable by the standard one-ended imbedding technique. In particular, a procedure doubling the number of stages at each iteration is given for problems with time-invariant coefficients."
"The error contained in several engineering texts on systems theory regarding Sylvester's criterion for positive-semidefinite matrices is brought to the fore."
"In the paper by Tse and Athans [1] an ad hoc control scheme was proposed which the authors claimed will converge to an asymptotically optimum control law. The proposition is based heavily on [1, theorem 1]. In a recent correspondence, Harunoglu and Brasch [2] give a counterexample indicating that [1, theorem 1] is incorrect. The purpose of this correspondence is to provide a correct statement for Theorem 1 and to develop an ad hoc control scheme which is asymptotically optimum."
  "Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the nonnegativity of a partially singular quadratic functional associated with a linear system. The conditions parallel known conditions for the totally singular problem, and a known sufficiency condition for the partially singular problem can be derived from them."
"A frequency-domain criterion for the L2-stability of systems containing a single time-varying gain in an otherwise time-invariant linear feedback loop is given. This is an improvement upon the earlier criteria presented by the authors in permitting an interchangeability of the allowable bounds on the logarithmic variation of the gain."
"The close relations are discussed that exist among the three subspaces that arise in three apparently unrelated problem areas: 1) the subspace associated with the error of state vector reconstruction in informationally decentralized control problems; 2) the subspace associated with the solution of the Riccati equation; and 3) the null space of the certain observation matrix constructed by the structure algorithm."
"An interconnected system of complete-reset pulse frequency modulators (CRPFM's) and linear dynamic subsystems is considered. Upper bounds are determined for the number of pulses emitted by each modulator. Each of these bounds represents a measure of the energy spent by the respective modulator. Finiteness of these bounds for all modulators constitues finite-pulse stability and implies finite energy expanded. Sufficient conditions are established for finite-pulse stability."
"Preliminary results show sequential unconstrained minimization techniques (SUMT) to be a viable filter design method. A nonlinear optimal filter design problem subject to nonlinear side constraints is formulated and solved using SUMT."
 "A class of optimal control problems is treated. The mathematical programming approach is used by employing a special piecewise polynomial parameterization of the control profile. A method for evaluating the gradient of the cost with respect to the various parameters is developed; this enables the optimal values of the parameters to be determined by minimizing the cost through a gradient search method. The algorithm is illustrated by a computed example."
"A gradient computational procedure is developed for discrete-time optimal control problems in which the current cost and rule governing state transitions depend on the entire past history of states and decisions. A condition necessary for optimality is also deduced in two ways and given physical interpretation."
"In this investigation, the unmodeled accelerations acting on an orbiting space vehicle are approximated by a first-order Gauss-Markov process. An extended Kalman-Bucy filter is used to estimate the state and the unmodeled accelerations at each observation epoch. Applications of the estimation algorithm to tracking data obtained during the Apollo 10 and 11 missions indicate that a more accurate estimate of the state is obtained and that the estimated values of the unmodeled accelerations can be correlated with physical phenomena neglected by the mathematical model."

"This correspondence considers a multivariable system with proper rational matrix transfer functions G0and Gfin the forward and feedback branches, respectively. It develops a strictly algebraic procedure to obtain polynomials whose zeros are the poles of the matrix transfer functions from input to output (Hy), and from input to error (He). G0and Gfare given in the polynomial matrix factored formN_{0}D_{0}^{-1}andD_{f}^{-1}N_{f}.

 "This paper investigates the problem of designing a compensating control for a linear multivariable system so that the impulse response matrix of the resulting closed-loop system coincides with the impulse response matrix of a prespecified linear model; this is the model following problem. A new formulation of the problem is developed, and necessary and sufficient conditions for a solution to exist are given. An upper bound is determined for the number of integrators needed to construct the compensating control and, if the open-loop plant in question possesses a left-invertible transfer matrix, this bound is shown to be as small as possible. The relationship between the internal structure of a model following system and the model being followed is explained, and a description is given of the possible distributions of system eigenvalues which can be achieved while maintaining a model following configuration. This leads to a statement of necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution to the problem which results in a stable compensated system."
"A class of linear, stochastic, jump parameter systems is studied in which the probability law of the parameter processes depends upon the control policy used. An optimal controller is given when the loss function is quadratic. Because of difficulties inherent in the design equations, a more easily evaluated, near optimal controller is provided for problems in which the parameter processes are weakly dependent on the control policy."
"For discrete linear stochastic systems, a fixed-point smoothing algorithm is given to obtain optimal estimates of the state of the system at timek = i(ifixed) when noisy linear measurements of the state are not available until the timek = j(j > i).

"Recently Klessig and Polak have shown that a variation of the Polak-Ribière conjugate gradient reset algorithm convergesn-step quadratically even if the one-dimensional search is not performed exactly. It is shown here thatn-step quadratic convergence is also obtained for a modification of the Fletcher-Reeves conjugate gradient reset algorithm with inaccurate one-dimensional search."

"The following aspects of discrete optimal terminal control of a linear system with a quadratic performance index are considered: 1) specification of a performance index that will give satisfactory results from an engineering standpoint at the critical terminal time; 2) closed-form algebraic solutions of the control law that are computationally feasible on-line, without necessitating prior lengthy off-line computation and storage. For a linear plant with discrete control, it is shown how a generalized performance index can be modified slightly in order to provide implicit feedback. The original plant and control problem are replaced by an \"equivalent plant\" (with eigenvalues that are shifted only if those of the original plant are unsuitable) and an \"equivalent problem.\" The equivalent problem (with a slight restriction) has a performance index whose loss function weights only the control, and is solved for the optimal control in closed form with minimal difficulty from literal matrix inversion. Solution of the optimal control in the original problem is a minor additional step. If the original plant has suitable eigenvalues, as in the case of a missile system with a well-designed autopilot, then the equivalent problem reduces to the original problem because there is no need for implicit feedback via the performance index. For a general missile-guidance problem, the solution of the restricted equivalent problem with discrete control is given. The example is for a missile airframe (without a conventional autopilot) having unsuitable eigenvalues. Performance in terms of rms state variables is sharply improved by making the equivalent plant have eigenvalues that correspond to a fast integral of the squared acceleration error response."
"Analysis and/or control problems arising in utility systems are often of high dimensionality. As a result, the usual symbology of formal vector-matrix notation can obscure structural properties of the system or model which might otherwise allow very simple numerical solution. Simultaneous sparse systems arising from a number of different areas are shown to be of this type, including problems of electric power flow, water distribution, mechanical structure analysis, differential equation solution, optimal control, and linear programming. All are highly amenable to efficient solution schemes employing the sparse-matrix method of ordered triangular factorization."
"Alternative utility specifications are imbedded in a simple calculus of variations problem to obtain complete sets of demand equations and their associated aggregate consumption function. In three cases, the resulting consumption functions are linear in prices and income with no intercept. For parameter identification, empirical work should be based upon the underlying demand systems."

The result is used to furnish necessary and sufficient conditions for solvability of the infinite-time optimal linear regulator problem. The control law is shown to be \"robust\" in the sense of preserving output regulation despite small variations in the feedback gains."

    "A brief but up-to-date survey on existing methods of designing a class of model reference adaptive control systems is given in this paper. A comparison of the merits of the various design rules is also made with particular attention to the M.I.T. rule and the Lyapunov synthesis technique. Subsequently a systematic performance comparison of the various designs, with deterministic as well as stochastic inputs, is presented using the computer simulation studies of two simple gain adjustment schemes. From the dimensionless characteristic graphs obtained the Lyapunov schemes are found to exhibit superior performance over other designs. These graphs also uncover the strange adaptive response of those designs based on gradient methods in that the performance index may increase or decrease with increasing system gain parameters."
"This paper considers the problem of stabilizing a linear time-invariant multivariable system by using several local feedback control laws. Each local feedback control law depends only on partial system outputs. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of local control laws with dynamic compensation to stabilize a given system is derived. This condition is stated in terms of a new notion, called \"fixed modes,\" which is a natural generalization of the well-known concept of uncontrollable modes and unobservable modes that occur in centralized control system problems. A procedure that constructs a set of stabilizing feedback control laws is given."
"An operations research problem concerning the optimal surface-to-air-missile (SAM) firing pattern to defend a surface target is solved via applications of the concept of closed-loop (feedback) and open-loop optimal control. The SAM defense problem is formulated as a Markov decision process with the number of SAM's in each salvo as the decision variable. Interesting cases, including the presence of imperfect sensor observation and a bound on the number of SAM's available are considered. The principle of dynamic programming and the technique of nonlinear integer programming are applied to reach closed-loop and open-loop solutions. Numerical examples are given for illustration."
"This paper provides a detailed survey and extension of certain properties of the stable regulator problem: determine\\min\\inf{u} \\int\\min{0}\\max{\\infty} x'Qx + u'u dtsubject to\\dot{x} = Fx + Gu; x(0) = x_{0}; \\liminf{t \\rightarrow \\infty} x(t) = 0whereQis not necessarily sign definite. First, equivalence conditions recently given by Willems for the existence of the minimum are extended to include statements in terms of the Hamiltonian matrix and spectral factorization. This provides a precise relation between the time-domain and frequency-domain solutions to the problems. Second, the inverse problem of whether a given feedbacku = -Kxis optimal for someQis easily resolved, as is the redundancy problem of distinct Q1and Q2, resulting in the same optimal control."
"Nonlinear optimal regulators are discussed, and some useful properties are isolated. An inverse problem of nonlinear regulator design is posed and solved."
"We show that least-squares filtered and smoothed estimates of a random process given observations of another colored noise process can be expressed as certain linear combinations of the state vector of the so-called innovations representation (IR) of the observed process. The IR of a process is a representation of it as the response of a causal and causally invertible linear filter to a white-noise \"innovations\" process. For nonstationary colored noise processes, the IR may not always exist and a major part of this paper is devoted to the problem of identifying a proper class of such processes and of giving effective recursive algorithms for their determination. The IR can be expressed either in terms of the parameters of a known lumped model for the process or in terms of its covariance function. In the first case, our results on estimation encompass most of those found in the previous literature on the subject; in the second case, there seems to be no prior literature. Finally, we may note that our proofs rely on, and exploit in both directions, the intimate relation that exists between least-squares estimation and the innovations representation."
"A full order adaptive observer is described for observing the state of a single-input single-output observable continuous differential system with unknown parameters. Convergence of the observer states to those of the system is accomplished by directly changing the parameters of the observer using an adaptive law based upon Lyapunov stability theory. Observer eigenvalues may be freely chosen. Some restriction is placed upon the system input in that it must be sufficiently rich in frequencies in order to insure convergence."
"This paper considers the suboptimal stochastic control of linear discrete-time dynamical systems with uncertain or stochastically varying parameters. The suboptimal scheme is based upon the use of the open-loop-feedback-optimal (OLFO) method. The state and parameter estimates are generated by an extended Kalman filter algorithm. Numerical results for first-order systems are presented."
"An adaptive scheme is devised which observes the state and simultaneously identifies all the parameters of a single-input single-outputnth-order linear system. The scheme uses only the input and the output signals of the system and does not involve the use of derivatives of these signals. The adaptive scheme is proved to be globally asymptotically stable, thus ensuring the convergence of the identification process."
"We consider a continuous-time, single-input, single-output, linear time-invariant distributed feedback system perturbed by a small delay in the loop. Conditions are given under which the L2- stability and L2-instability of this feedback system can be deduced from those of the unperturbed system (obtained by setting the delay equal to zero). These conditions require the examination of a high-frequency approximation to the unperturbed system. The precise results are stated in Theorem 1. Our condition for neglecting the small delay in the L2-stability problem is stricter than the well-posedness condition given by Willems."
"The optimal linear regulator with state-dependent sampling is formulated and the existence of an optimal solution is proved. A search algorithm is developed which uses both the necessary conditions obtained from nonlinear programming theory and a sequential unconstrained minimization technique to compute the optimal control. An application is presented."
"The effect of a class of plant parameter uncertainties upon the state vector estimation of a system driven by a deterministic forcing function is considered. For this problem the minimization of mean-square error and the minimization of bias error are opposing goals. The set of noninferior solutions for the optimal control problem whose performance index has components mean-square error and bias error is considered, and evaluated."
"This paper considers the problem of designing an optimal linear time-invariant dynamic compensator for the regulation of annth-order linear time-invariant plant. The usual quadratic cost on the state and control is averaged over initial plant state values. The globally optimal compensator gains and dynamic order are determined by showing that this problem is mathematically identical to a steady-state stochastic control problem whose optimal solution is known."
"A random variable is said to have elliptical distribution if its probability density is a function of a quadratic form. This class includes the Gaussian and many other useful densities in statistics. It is shown in this paper that this class of densities can be expressed as integrals of a set of Gaussian densities. This property is not changed under linear transformation of the random variables. It is also proved in this paper that the conditional expectation is linear with exactly the same form as the Gaussian case. Many estimation results of the Gaussian case can be readily extended. Problems of computing optimal estimation, filtering, stochastic control, and team decisions in various linear systems become tractable for this class of random processes."

"For a single-output linear time-invariant system, output controllability is shown to be a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of linear state variable feedback that freely assigns the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system that are observable from the output. An application of this result to the single-output linear servomechanism shows that the ability of such a system to track with zero steady-state error and an arbitrary transient response is equivalent to output controllability of the plant, and is independent of the class of command signals and disturbances."

"This paper presents an example of a two-person cooperative game, where the control of the first player is at the same time information to the second player.

"The structure of the innovations process is examined as the gain of a Kalman filter is allowed to deviate from its optimum structure. The state model of the resulting pseudoinnovations process is determined, and it is shown how the level (or variance) of the process depends on the difference between the desired Kalman gain and the gain actually being employed. The model illustrates requirements on an arbitrary gain matrix to ensure stable filter performance."
"The problem of simulating a class of nonstationary processes with nonseparable covariances is considered. When a process covariance function vanishes outside a finite interval, standard techniques of shaping filter realization fail because the covariance function is no longer separable.

Necessary and sufficient conditions are established for the existence of a factorization, and two illustrative examples are presented."

"Most econometric models have many versions which differ from one another by 1) minor variations in the specification, or 2) choice of parameter estimator. This paper demonstrates how control theory can be employed to discriminate between alternative versions of an econometric model. For many policy problems involving a simple objective function and a single control variable, the investigator can hypothesize from the tenets of a given economic theory qualitative characteristics of the optimal economic behavior. By computing the optimal economic policy, the investigator can determine which versions are consistent with the hypothesis. This procedure was employed to determine which versions of a revised form of the Klein-Goldberger model are consistent with three hypotheses derived from economic theory. For the first two hypotheses, the results indicate that consistency depends on the choice of parameter estimates. For the third hypothesis, an inflation test at full employment, the results indicate that all versions are inconsistent with the hypothesis."

The automaton can operate in environments characterized by reward strengths (S-models) or reward probabilities (P-models).

The algorithm discussed here was originally reported by Mason with emphasis on theP-model case. In this paper, emphasis is placed on theS-model case. Recently, an equivalent ε-optimal algorithm has been reported by Viswanathan and Narendra. It is Shown herein that only the optimal solution is stable and that the expected performance converges monotonically. Simulation results are presented that corroborate the analytical results. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is superior tO McLaren's linear reinforcement scheme in regard to expediency."

"We use the innovations method to solve some linear estimation problems for stochastic processes described as the solution of high-order linear difference equations driven by colored noise. Such models are often called vector or multivariable auto-regressive-moving average (ARMA) models. We illustrate how the use of ARMA models can provide some simplifications and some new results in the problem of state estimation in colored noise."
     "A discrete time linear systemx_{t+1}= Ax_{t} + Bu_{t'}y = Cx_{t'}, with output feedbacku_{t} = G_{t}y_{t'}, call be regarded as a nonlinear system with \"control\" Gt. Weak sufficient conditions are given for the existence of a finite sequence of gains for which every initial state can be driven to the origin. For a one input, one output system, the question of what terminal states can be reached from a given initial state is resolved. It is shown that an important ingredient for these problems is the semigroup of integers generated by the set\\{k:cA^{k-1}b \\neq 0, 1 \\leq k \\leq k \\leq 3n\\}(for a single input, single output system of dimensionn). It is also natural to use a pair of \"canonical forms,\" in the guise of polynomials, to represent states. One is useful for input considerations and the other for output considerations. For output feedback problems one must further distinguish between two polynomials which are equivalent in the sense that they represent the same state. This is due to the fact that some polynomials are ill-conditioned in that they would have us use a nonzero input when the output vanishes."
"The linear stochastic discrete-time realization problem is to find a white-noise driven finite-dimensional linear system whose output generates a specified separable covariance. The solution to this problem is presented in the form of a causal and causally invertible innovations representation (IR) whose existence depends only on the positive definite nature of the separable covariance. It is also shown that least-squares filtered and smoothed estimates of one process given observations of a related colored process can be expressed as linear combinations of the state vector of the IR of the observed process. The analogous continuous-time problems have been studied earlier, and it has been shown that an important role is played by what is known as the relative order of the covariance. Here this is defined as the number of differencing operations required to produce a delta function component in the differenced covariance. It is shown that, unlike the continuous-time case, the relative order of the covariance does not necessarily induce similar (relative order) constraints on the impulse response of all models whose responses to white noise have the given covariance. This fact is at the heart of certain differences between continuous-time and discrete-time results. It is shown, however, that the innovations representations obey a number of constraints equal to the relative order of the covariance."
"A discrete linear stationary system is considered for which the input noise covarianceQand the output noise covarianceRare unknown. A stable filter with a suboptimal gain is assumed. An identification scheme is presented which uses the autocorrelation functions of the innovations sequence of the suboptimal filter to determine the optimum filter steady state gain\\Gammadirectly without the intermediate determination of the unknown covariancesQandR. The approach used is to identify an output equivalent representation of the original system which does not involve the unknown covariances directly."
"Tracking performance in surveillance systems depends on two interrelated functions: track updating, the process of incorporating a new measurement into the track to update the system state estimate, and return-to-track correlation, the process of selecting which sensor return, if any, to use for track updating. Because of the presence of a number of targets in the same vicinity and the existence of clutter and false alarms, the correlation function is generally performed imperfectly. Since typical tracking filters such as the Kalman filter do not account for such correlation errors, degraded performance often results as well as unreliable and optimistic estimates of tracking accuracies. This paper examines and provides for optimizing the overall tracking process considering both the correlation and track update functions and their interaction. General equations for tracking performance of any arbitrary tracking filter used with a broad class of correlation algorithms in dense multitarget environments are developed. A new reoptimized tracking filter is derived which provides, from among a general class of tracking filters using a priori information on sensor return statistics, optimal performance in such environments and which reduces to the Kalman filter when environmental effects are eliminated. The new filter is compared parametrically to both the standard Kalman filter and a computationally simpler version of the optimal filter in terms of tracking accuracy and reliability of the calculated covariance matrix, over a spectrum of environmental conditions. At high densities of sensor returns, the new filter provides considerably improved tracking performance as well as uniquely reliable estimates of this performance."
"The purpose of this paper is to develop new methods for constructing vector Lyapunov functions and broaden the application of Lyapunov's theory to stability analysis of large-scale dynamic systems. The application, so far limited by the assumption that the large-scale systems are composed of exponentially stable subsystems, is extended via the general concept of comparison functions to systems which can be decomposed into asymptotically stable subsystems. Asymptotic stability of the composite system is tested by a simple algebraic criterion. By redefining interconnection functions among the subsystems according to interconnection matrices, the same mathematical machinery can be used to determine connective asymptotic stability of large-scale systems under arbitrary structural perturbations. With minor technical adjustments, the theory is broadened to include considerations of unstable subsystems as well as instability of composite systems."
"Problems of chemical process control, available theories and their inadequacies, and unwritten theories are forged into an essay that rallies colleagues to scale the towering and still untouched peaks on the frontier."
"The paper is concerned with the construction of bilinear state space descriptions from a prescribed nonlinear input-output map. The problem is shown to be equivalent to that of matching an infinite sequence of constant parameters which uniquely identifies the given map. Both the problems of requiring the matching over a finite number of terms of the sequence (partial realization problem) and over the whole sequence (complete realization problem) are treated. In both cases explicit existence criteria and an algorithm for finding minimal realizations are given. The approach is based on the introduction of a suitable infinite matrix formed with the input-output parameters, which can be considered as a generalization of the Hankel matrix usually considered in the realization theory of linear systems."

The approximating design procedure given is illustrated through examples which clarify and demonstrate it."

"Two types of necessary conditions have been derived for Pareto optimal solutions of vector-valued criteria problems. One type involves a scalarization process, while the other is in terms of a rank condition. In this correspondence it is shown that the two sets of necessary conditions are equivalent in the sense that if a solution satisfies one set of necessary conditions, it also satisfies the other."
"We obtain the following results. 1) Suppose thatz(t)and its firstmderivativesz^{(k)}(t), k = 1,...,m, are continuous functions with values in a normed linear vector space. We define a class of linear functionals and show that if a functional in the class is applied toz^{(k)}and vanishes for0 \\leq k \\leq m - 1but does not vanish fork = m, then the vectors\\{z^{(k)}(t)\\}are linearly independent for eachtin the domain ofz(\\cdotp). 2) If nowz^{(k)}(t), k = 0,...,mare mean-square continuous random processes such thatz^{(m+1)}(\\cdotp)has a nonvanishing white-noise component, then the random variables\\{z^{(k)}(t)\\}, k = 0,..,m, are linearly independent. These results are shown to be related both in formulation and method of solution."

"The signals carried by a CATV system generally consist of a great many (20 or more) amplitude-modulated picture carriers, each accompanied by its frequency-modulated sound carrier. In a large system, these signals pass through as many as 50 amplifiers in tandem. To avoid appreciable degradation of the received picture, distortion products must be kept 50 to 60 dB below the picture signal for the entire system, which implies distortion levels 90 to 100 dB down in the individual amplifiers."
"When a nonlinearity is modeled as memoryless with a three-term power series, a convenient way of expressing the characteristics is by the use of intercept points. An intercept point is the output power level at which the fundamental tone and the distortion tone have equal amplitudes. For many practical system problems, specification of an intercept point permits very quick calculation of distortion tone levels; in particular, given two equal amplitude fundamental tones at similar frequencies, the adjacent third order distortion product is down from a fundamental by twice the number of decibels that the fundamental is down from the third order intercept point. Even more simply, the second order distortion is down from a fundamental by an amount equal to the number of decibels that the fundamental is down from the appropriate intercept point."
"In many cases single tone and two-tone testing of nonlinear devices yield sufficient information for the systems designer. Additional diagnostics can be obtained from three-tone testing."
"Amplitude and phase non-linearities in multichannel FM transmission systems must be closely controlled to avoid excessive intermodulation noise in the derived message channels. Though parameters may be measured individually, their combined effect on distortion performances most directly measured by applying a standard test signal to the FM system which closely simulates the working multi-channel baseband signal. For high capacity systems, this baseband signal is closely approximated by a band of Gaussian (white) noise, band-limited at the same frequencies as the working baseband."

"A synthesis procedure is presented for nondispersive surface acoustic wave filters having unanodized transducers. The simplest filter design utilizes flat-passband transducers whose uniform acoustic beam is useful in acoustic correlators and reflective array pulse compressors (RAC). Another device is a spectral weighting (e.g. Hamming) filter which may be a separate unit or an integral part of a RAC."
"Surface wave acoustic device technology continues to generate new ideas, analyses and potential applications at an impressive rate. Concomitant introduction of some specific low-frequency prototypes into systems design and subsequently hardware is witness to the growing acceptance of this technology by the systems community. The demand for specific filter functions at steadily increasing frequencies is a natural consequence of this trend. Therefore, second order as well as high frequency effects must be understood in detail, if the desired filter properties are to be realized. In this paper the authors discuss the design and fabrication of a microwave delay line with a precisely specified bandpass characteristic and center frequency. The filter design required a parabolic form factor (to within /spl plus mn/0.3 dB) and essentially ripple free (<0. 1 dB) in-band response between 3 dB points. The filter was fabricated using three-period tuned interdigital transducers produced by electron beam microfabrication. The emphasis of this paper will be on interaction of the various effects, such as electrical load and acoustic mass loading, frequency dependent propagation loss and matching element parasitic which, particularly at microwave frequencies, render the achievement of the desired pass band properties more difficult. In addition, the accuracy and stability requirements of the electron beam microfabrication of micron-sized electrode geometry will be discussed. The sources and control of spurious response ripples which degrade the otherwise smooth transfer function are also discussed."

Time inversion of microwave signals has been demonstrated with uniform output for signal lengths up to 5 /spl mu/s, by compensating for the signal distortion resulting from delay line attenuation."

This paper uses a method based on readily available sweep oscillators. A system for proper termination of the \"unused\" port is described.

A one-dimensional hologram is constructed at S band and an image is reconstructed by the proposed method. These results are discussed and compared with the results of the conventional numerical reconstruction."
"A nonlinear circuit model for avalanche diodes is proposed.

"The waveshape of the local-oscillator voltage component that exists across the nonlinear junction of a Shottky-barrier diode is a fundamental determinant of mixer performance. This waveshape significantly differs from that of the total local-oscillator voltage impressed across the diode terminals since it is influenced by parasitic, particularly spreading resistance and contact inductance, which exist in series with the junction. The junction-voltage waveshapes resulting from a 9.375-GHz sinusoidal local-oscillator generator voltage are computed for three common equivalent-circuit models of the diode. In the first model the diode is represented by a nonlinear conductance in series with a fixed spreading resistance. The second model includes the nonlinear capacitance associated with the junction, and the third additionally includes the contact inductance. In each case, the junction-voltage waveshape is significantly nonsinusoidal. It is shown that the contact inductance can induce a peak inverse junction voltage that greatly exceeds the peak voltage impressed across the diode terminals. This parasitic reactance thus can have an important bearing on the burnout properties of the mixer diode."
"A novel design procedure for diplexers built in waveguides below cutoff is presented. The design permits the integral construction of a diplexer--the whole unit is built in a single waveguide, thereby dispensing with the T junction and connecting flanges--if coaxial termination is used at the common junction. The design utilizes foreshortened bandpass filters, and is valid for bandwidths of up to a few percent. Simple expressions on calculating the connecting lengths are arrived at. A satellite telemetry diplexer designed using the derived expressions yields results which are in agreement with computed values."

"Latching phase shifters, consisting of a waveguide section containing a ferrite toroid, are widely used as digital steering elements in microwave array antennas. The theoretical determination of device performance cannot be obtained exactly, since these structures are inhomogeneous along both transverse directions. The present study presents an approximate method to evaluate phase shift and losses in the case of a rectangular toroid. An approximately equivalent structure (twin slab), for which an exact resolution method is available, is considered first. The changes due to the upper and lower sections of the toroid are then evaluated by means of a variational principle. Experimental results show good agreement with computed values for several practical cases considered. Finally, the range of validity for this approximate method is determined."

"The application of meander lines to impedance transformers is described. Meander-line transformers have less bandwidth than stepped-impedance transformers for a given passband VSWR, but can have greatly superior shape factors in stripline and microwave-integrated-circuit (MIC) realizations. Hybrid meander-line transformers allow circuit designers greatly increased flexibility in choosing transformer shape factors, while allowing (basically) the same electrical performance as with either stepped-impedance or meander-line transformers. Experimental confirmations of a trial three-turn meander-line transformer and a fourth-order hybrid meander-line transformer are presented. A comprehensive design table of nearly equal-ripple meander-line transformers of from two to six turns, incorporating a wide range of bandwidths and impedance transformations has been deposited with the ASIS National Auxiliary Publications Service."

"The problem of two thick interacting inductive irises in waveguide is treated with a variational approach. Using the appropriate Green's functions in the continuity equations of the transverse magnetic fields yields two coupled integral equations for the magnetic currents on the apertures. Solving one equation by Fourier expansion and introducing in the remaining equation, a variational expression for the driving-point admittance is obtained. This is treated with a Rayleigh-Ritz procedure and matrix methods, avoiding the explicit computation of field amplitudes. The analysis is carried out in terms of an eigenmode expansion, as well as in terms of an expansion a la Schwinger on the aperture and the features of the two methods are contrasted. In spite of its somewhat greater mathematical complexity, the latter generally provides a superior solution for a given order of the trial field. In both cases the solutions are very accurate, uniformly convergent to their common limit value, and require manipulations with small-order matrices only. The agreement with the experiment is excellent."

The theory is based on a realistic model of the oscillator, including an object passing in front of an antenna, and includes the previous treatments as the limiting cases. The effect of the bias circuit taking out the Doppler signal on the RF operation of the oscillator is taken into account self-consistently. The frequency down-conversion with a free-running oscillator is also investigated. Conversion gain is demonstrated by the experiment using a Gunn oscillator with a movable load."
"A new theory for the design of branch-guide couplers, which enables the designer to optimize the internal impedance level, is presented. This overcomes previous difficulties associated with design of branch-guide couplers for tight-coupling values. Results are demonstrated for couplings as tight as 1.5 dB and give exact agreement between computer predictions and measured results. The theory was used to design a complex matched power divider employing many branch-guide couplers of 14 different coupling values and gave practical results in close agreement with theory."
"An explicit least-squares criterion is put forward as an alternative to the point-matching method of numerically solving scattering problems. While being an established method of functional approximation, it has been largely ignored in numerical approaches to electromagnetic scattering. In contrast to point matching, the least-squares approach has a rigorous proof of convergence. An electric/magnetic weighting factor is found useful in optmizing convergence. Finally, it allows use of perhaps the fastest and most compact matrix inversion algorithm."
"The port admittance matrix of a planar network is formulated in terms of certain harmonic functions related to the port voltages and the network geometry, together with the natural modes of the network with all ports shorted. The necessary harmonic functions and eigenfunctions are found using a finite element technique, for which general-purpose computer programs already exist. An advantage of the method is that the admittance matrix appears in partial-fraction form with geometric data separated from frequency, leading to inexpensive computations where recalculation at various frequencies is required."
"DC and microwave-biased measurements of the photoresponse spectrum of sulfur-sensitized CdS single crystals were made in a K-band (22-GHz) reflection bridge. The experimental arrangement was such that both dc and microwave measurements could be performed at different temperatures without changing the rest of the sample's environment. For the microwave measurements, the response spectra were narrower and shifted toward shorter wavelengths than for the dc measurements."
"The problem of the propagation of transverse magnetoplasma waves in drifted, stratified, media consisting of periodically distributed homogeneous slabs of solid-state plasmas is investigated. The action of the drifting carriers is to introduce an asymmetry into the propagation characteristics while the influence of the periodic structure introduces space harmonics. A detailed assessment of the possibility of a synchronous space-harmonic interaction for on-axis waves, which leads to wave amplification, has been performed. It is found that, contrary to the results of some prior work in the field, the gain that occurred could not be attributed directly to the periodic structure."
"A variational expression involving the longitudinal fields in an inhomogeneous lossless waveguide, which acts as the starting point for numerical procedures, is shown to be equivalent to a simple relationship between power flow, stored energy, and phase velocity."
"Measurements of FM noise and the external quality factor Q/sub ex/ of X-band Gunn oscillators are reported which show that both unconverted and intrinsic FM noise vary inversely as Q/sub ex/, if bias voltage, RF power, and frequency are kept constant."
"A technique to temperature stabilize a Gunn-effect CW oscillator (C band) in microstrip, has been developed."
"A launcher for coupling a 50-/spl Omega/ suspended stripline to a waveguide by means of a probe has been built and tested at 30 GHz. Matching has been obtained between 28.8 and 32.6 GHz with a return loss better than 35 dB. The launcher can be fabricated as an integral part of the stripline components."
"Conflicting definitions of the parameters characterizing the material in ferrite-electromagnetic wave interactions occur in the current literature, as well as do actual sign errors that are difiicult to detect because of the variety of signs appended to the relevant quantities by different authors. A harmonious set of definitions are set out and their consistency illustrated using the case of a uniform circularly polarized plane wave."

"An equivalent circuit for a J-band transferred-electron oscillator containing lumped and distributed elements is proposed. Using element values obtained independently, the equivalent circuit is shown to have broad-band applicability and is capable of explaining, in a strictly quantitative fashion, frequency saturation and the loss or absence of circuit-controlled oscillation. It is shown that the S4 type of encapsulation places severe constraints on the mounting structure and is not ideally suited to the J-band waveguide oscillator for optimum power-frequency characteristics over a broad band. The analysis of the full equivalent circuit given does, however, permit analytic solutions for important oscillator design parameters such as mounting post diameter, which enables simple post-mounted J-band oscillators that are free from frequency saturation and loss of circuit-controlled oscillation in the band to be easily designed."
"A generalization of previous oscillator noise analyses has been developed to permit reliable noise characterization of active nonlinear devices. Effects due to sideband correlation in the equivalent noise source are included. A rotating wave approximation (RWA) developed by Lax is used in obtaining the amplitude and phase noise spectra. Conditions are given for phase stabilization of free-running oscillators and for minimum phase noise in phase-Iocked oscillators and amplifiers. Stability criteria, discussion of spurious sidetones, and effects of a noisy synchronizing signal are given. The noise measure is used to obtain alternative expressions for the noise spectra and the carrier-to-noise ratios of locked oscillators and amplifiers. It is shown that the noise power gain of AM fluctuations is usually much lower than the corresponding gain for FM noise. The theory should be useful in optimizing the noise performance of nonlinear RF generators, such as IMPATT, BARITT, and Gunn diode oscillators."
"It is shown that the effects of discontinuity capacitances associated with the abrupt change in the center conductor diameter of a coaxial bandpass filter can readily be anticipated at the designing stage."
"An inequality relating the scattering coefficients of a passive Iossy-reciprocal or nonreciprocal two-port is derived. For the reciprocal two-port the inequality reduces to that presented by Uhlir."
"An MIC S- to Ku-band upper-sideband upconverter has shown a pump efficiency of 25 percent and 3.8-dB signal gain. When used as a lower-sideband upconverter, gains of 13 dB and 100- MHz bandwidth were measured."
"Some results on X-band varactor-tuned Gunn oscillators in a full-height waveguide cavity are presented. It is shown that it is possible to obtain an electronic tuning range of over 1 GHz at X band with an appreciable output power level, which is also nearly constant with frequency. Results of FM noise measurements on one such oscillator are also reported."
"Numerical \"shooting\" methods are employed in obtaining the dispersion curves of a coaxial waveguide loaded with a radially inhomogeneous dielectric. The utility of this technique is tested by comparing results with known analytical solutions. The method is also used to find the dispersion curves of a coaxial waveguide loaded with a radially Gaussian-distributed plasma."
"A technique is described that makes possible the accurate measurement of the dielectric constant of microwave integrated-circuit substrates. The substrate is metallized on all sides, hence forming a tiny resonant cavity, and the resonant frequencies are determined either from transmission or reflection. The dielectric constant is then calculated to an accuracy of better than 1 percent."
"Dispersion predictions for the even and odd modes of parallel-coupled microstrip obtained by using the LSE-mode model for microstrip are found to be in good agreement with recently published measurements. Both the basic dispersion relationship and the empirical factor G appear to be the same as for single microstrip lines if the even- and odd-mode impedances used are those of the total parallel-coupled configuration rather than those of a single line of the coupled pair."
"The influence of the T-junction effect on the microstrip 3-dB branchline and rat-race directional couplers design has been described. In the proposed method, the T-junction equivalent circuit similar to the circuit used by Franco and Oliner for the symmetric stripline junction is applied. Simple design expressions that combine the modified characteristic impedance and electrical length of the coupler arm with the equivalent parameters of the T-junction are given. These expressions are helpful in the determination of the microstrip coupler dimensions. The experimental verification of an improvement of the design procedure is also included."
"It is shown that consideration of both the external microwave circtuit and the dc bias applied to the diode are necessary in order to obtain satisfactory locking results with an LSA oscillator. When both are properly arranged, good control of both the operating frequency and the phase of an LSA oscillator at 3 GHz is demonstrated."
"The calibration of microwave radiometers is normally achieved by replacing the antenna with a cooled reference termination and then applying corrections for ohmic and reflective losses of the antenna, and for the nonideality of the reference termination. The uncertainty in this correction is the dominating factor in the precision of many high-quality radiometers, and for some applications it is unacceptably large. An alternative is to point the antenna at a target of known temperature. To the extent that this temperature is known and the target is reflectionless and encompasses the full view of the antenna, the calibration is ex'act and no further corrections are required. A target suitable for high-precision radiometry has been developed that has an accurately known radiometric temperature, a very low reflection coefficient, and whose geometry is well suited to the calibration of horn antennas. The essence of the temperature reference is described. A piece of porous microwave absorber having a convoluted surface for a low reflection coefficient is fitted with a cap of nonporous plastic foam whose mating surface is the inverse of that of the absorber. The microwave-absorbing material is then soaked with the chosen cryogen, the nonporous cap forcing the liquid to conform to the shape of said absorbing material. This procedure 1) ensures that the temperature at which the microwaves are absorbed (and therefore thermally emitted) is exactly that of the cryogen, and 2) avoids the reflection that would be produced by the dielectric discontinuity of a plane surface of cryogen."
"The successful application of thin-film lumped-element circulators (LEC) at L band has led to the following question: How far can these devices be extended in frequency using our present beam-crossover technology? An exploratory study aimed at building an LEC at approximately 4 GHz was successfully completed. Preliminary tests showed a 20-dB band from 4.2 to 5 GHz with an insertion loss <1 dB (minimum, 0.5 dB). This includes fixture losses, which account for about 0.2 dB. The device has been tuned to operate above 5 GHz, and from the experiments it is concluded that a device of this type could be built at frequencies as high as X band. These devices are very small; at 4 GHz, the circulator junction is a 0.075- in diam."
"An exact analytical expression for calculating the limits of phase error that can occur when the reflection coefficient of a load is measured through a lossless two-port network is presented. Art empirical expression previously reported by Garver et al. agrees well with the exact expression, except when the reflection coefficients of the lossless two-port and the load are nearly the same in magnitude."
 "The use of cylindrical mirrors to focus 52-GHz beams over a 85-m-long path has been previously reported (1972). The author now reports the results of tests made at 52 and 104 GHz over an extended 350-m-long path incorporating 10 refocusers (20 mirrors). It is shown that commercial (l-m by l-m) glass mirrors can be used for guiding and directing the 104-GHz beams with little losses."
 "Suilicient conditions for the quasi-TEM mode in a ferrite-filled coaxial line are reviewed."
"The T-septum waveguide was analyzed by Elliott using the orthonormal block method. The numerical results did not compare favorably with experimental measurements and it was suggested that the disparity was related primarily to the assumption of zero-thickness membranes for the septum. Later, Silvester analyzed the T-septum waveguide using a finite-element method and found very good agreement with the measured points, yet the septum thickness was again assumed to be infinitesimal. This letter is being written to dispel the implication that the orthonormal block method of analysis of the T-septum waveguide suffers for lack of accuracy. The universal curves as shown by Elliott will be presented here in corrected form along with experimental results further corroborating both Elliott's and Silvester's work."
"In a number of well-known texts, misleading statements are made concerning the reason for eliminating the Neumann or Bessel function of the second kind from the solution of the wave equations in circular cylindrical coordinates for a homogeneous region containing the coordinate axis. This letter discusses the conditions that are required to arrive at a unique solution."

 "The design of surface acoustic wave bandpass filters which utilize interdigital electrode transducers is reviewed. The impulse-response description of interdigital transducers is extended to allow calculation of transducer input admittance and filter frequency response with much less effort than required by earlier equivalent-circuit model approaches. The application of the impulse model to the straightforward design of VHF and higher frequency bandpass filters is discussed and several examples of high-performance surface-wave bandpass filters are given."
"The development of a low-loss broad-band linear FM dispersive filter having a time-bandwidth (TB) product of 1000 is discussed. Two systems applications for highly dispersive linear FM filters--pulse compression RADAR and a microscan receiver--are discussed with emphasis on filter performance requirements. The principal factors which influence the design of surface-wave filters are reviewed and theoretical design procedures are outlined. The 1000:1 filters, which are implemented on strong-coupling YZ lithium niobate, typically meet the design goal of a 100-MHZ rectangular passband and have a CW insertion loss of less than 35 dB. Measured data are presented for the filter performance in a pulse-compression loop and in a prototype broad-band microscan (compressive) receiver."
"The IMCON is a reflection-mode dispersive delay line capable of high performance in large time-bandwidth product pulse compression systems. As developed in this paper, the unique characteristics of the IMCON are obtained by reflection from a double grating array that is applied to the surface of a strip. Current models of the device have center frequencies in the 4-30-MHz range with bandwidth up to 15 MHz, dispersion to 320 /spl mu/s time sidelobes on the order of --40 dB (with equalization), and other spurious signals at least 70 dB below the compressed output. The characteristics of IMCON operation are developed from a consideration of the device's transfer function. In particular, the IMCON'S high linearity and low sensitivity to fabrication and propagation problems are shown to be due to a unique error rejection effect. By comparison, the error rejection characteristics of single grating and dispersive transducer devices are found to be inferior to the IMCON. Data derived from operating pulse compression systems are utilized to demonstrate the low time sidelobe and high time-bandwidth capability of the IMCON."
"A new type of surface-wave device has been developed which uses the reflection of surface elastic waves to achieve a desired transfer function. A series of experiments on the reflection of surface waves at normal and oblique incidence from periodic arrays of grooves and overlayer stripes provided guidelines for the choice of the type of reflector, the reflection angle, and the depth of grooves. A prototype pulse-compression filter with a time-bandwidth product of 1500 (T=30 /spl mu/S, /spl Delta/f=50 MHz) has been developed. The grooves were etched into LiNbO/sub 3/ by a neutralized argon ion beam in a manner which provided precise depth control and a desired amplitude response. This reflective-array compressor (RAC) has proved to be relatively free of spurious signals and second-order effects and, as a result, large capacities have been obtained. In the prototype device, rms phase errors were 3.5 deg or less and, as a result, the compressed-pulse sidelobe structure was near ideal. A compression ratio of 1500 was demonstrated. The same device, when operated over a wider bandwidth, yielded a compression ratio of about 4000 with only a modest sacrifice in the level of the time sidelobes."
"The multistrip coupler performs the function of a directional coupler for freely propagating surface acoustic waves on a piezoelectrically active substrate. Its operation is analyzed in terms of a transmission line based equivalent circuit. Expressions are obtained for the directionality (transmission and reflection) in terms of the number of coupler strips and the acoustic frequency. Theory and experiment are shown to be in very good agreement. 50-percent metallization is found to give optimum performance; progressive increase in the proportion of the coupler area covered with metal is shown to involve a progressive change from an inline field model to a crossed-field model. Outside a stopband region it is found that a simplified expression for the directionality is valid; this greatly facilitates component design. Design criteria for multistrip components are discussed in terms of substrate and bandwidth requirements. An analysis is included of resistive and capacitative effects on coupling, and problems associated with coupling between dissimilar materials are discussed."
"The multistrip coupler is a directional coupler which operates on freely propagating surface acoustic waves with broad bandwidth and low loss. The applications of simple multistrip couplers with straight strips are discussed together with descriptions and properties of a family of multistrip components that can perform particular operations. Stepped couplers can perform the function of collinear beamwidth compression and a surface-wave \"magic T\" may be constructed. Bent, U-shaped, and J-shaped structures are considered that may redirect or reflect acoustic beams, and results are presented for a multistrip unidirectional transducer. Complex acoustic circuits may be built up using these elements. A beam may be reflected and stepped to the side by one track width, and both directions of a delay line may be used sequentially to double its capacity. The spurious triple transit signal of a delay line is shown to be virtually eliminated at the expense of an extra 3-dB single transit loss."
"The properties of acoustic surface waveguides are reviewed, with particular reference to topographic structures in which guiding is achieved by drastic deformation of the substrate surface. A numerical technique, capable of computing efficiently and with high accuracy the mode spectrum of an anisotropic piezoelectric heterogeneous waveguide of arbitrary cross section, is described. Characteristics of both the ridge guide and the recently discovered wedge waveguide are discussed in some detail. Techniques for the fabrication of and transduction onto acoustic surface waveguides are discussed, and a preliminary assessment is made of potential linear and nonlinear waveguide applications. A number of experimental devices are described."
"An acoustic surface-wave memory is described, operating at a bit rate of 220 MHz and storage capcity of 1280 bit-per recirculation loop. The transducers are coded using orthogonal pairs of Golay complementary sequences to obtain pulse-in pulse-out behavior. The shape of the delayed pulse is analyzed and compared with the pulse shape that is obtained using a simple single finger pair transducer. The recirculation electronics uses standard MECL-III logic for both the amplifier and the write, read, inhibit, and reclocking functions. The cost of the recirculating memory and the feasibility of constructing larger capacity stores are also discussed."
"A new type of signal-processing device which employs the parametric interaction between surface or volume acoustic waves passing in opposite directions through an acoustic delay line is described. These devices are capable of giving the real-time convolution of two modulated signals, and the time inversion of an arbitrary signal. As one signal acts as the reference for the other, a virtually infinite range of electronically variable signal-processing functions, such as recognition of digital codes, pulse compression of an FM chirp, and the realization of a fast Fourier transform, is possible. Early devices which employed the nonlinearity of the acoustic medium tended to give outputs of the order of 60 dB less than the input signal. Recent developments, in which a semiconductor placed near the piezoelectric medium interacts with the acoustic wave, have yielded results where the loss from input to output is of the order of 30 dB."
"A new type of device is described in which an acoustoelectric surface wave interacts with low energy free charges created on the surface of a piezoelectric material. The experimental results obtained show that one of the most promising applications is an analog RF storage device for which several minutes of storage time have been achieved at 30 MHz on quartz with an internal insertion loss of 63 dB. If the width of the current pulse is large enough, direct attenuation of the surface wave may be measured due to the energy absorbed by the motion of secondary electrons. Experimental and theoretical results are presented. The limitations and the applications of the device to signal processing are discussed."
"Spread spectrum transmission is being proposed for an increasing number of digital communication, navigation, and RADAR systems. One of the reasons is the simplicity and availability of surface-wave devices (SWD) for performing the necessary signal generation and processing. The properties of spread spectrum signals, the operation of SWD's, and their advantages and limitations when used in communication systems are discussed. Spread spectrum terminology and basic concepts are defined in terms common to both systems engineers and device designers."
"A digital encoded multislope chirp modem/demodem unit has been implemented using two 3-port surface acoustic wave filters. Each filter operating at a 30-MHz center frequency provides either positive or negative slopes as digital 1's or 0's with a time-bandwidth product of 280, an unweighed bandwidth of 5.6 MHz, and a time dispersion of 50 /spl mu/S.The modems were used to calibrate and compare the operational performance of the conventions multitone CW ranging system with a multislope chirp ranging system. Range measurements and range-rate observations were made to a synchronous satellite with both systems using a ground communication satellite terminal. Both ranging techniques provided accuracies well within the predictable satellite range of 20 000 nmi; the multitone system provided a theoretical range resolution of 1 m, and the chirp system 0.4 m. Data transmission was also accomplished, using 12-bit binary code at a 1.25-Mbit rate. The significant advantage to be noted with the chirp system is the ability to obtain continuous range data from the satellite repeater simultaneously while other modes of information are being transmitted, and to combine the ranging and data-link transmission on a time-order basis using digital encoded chirp sequences. The chirp system was found the more desirable technique, since it provides a more direct range measurement, with minimal calibration requirements, and provided greater processing gain with relative ease and reliability. The data transmission at low data rates provided little deterioration in theoretical compressive gain. However, at the higher data rate a greater loss was encountered due to power sharing of the overlapping chirp coded carriers in the limiting satellite."
"A review of programmable surface acoustic wave filters is presented. The elementary theory, fabrication procedures, and device performance are described in light of recent technological advances. Both hybrid and monolithic structures are considered. The relative advantages of programming techniques which utilize diode switching are compared to those that make use of solid-state, three-terminal, and acoustic wave detectors."
"The potential role of acoustic matched filters in the demanding field of civil and military air-traffic control (ATC) systems is examined. Highlighted are the problems of current ATC systems and the significant aspects of acoustic matched filters and their expeditious usage in modems employing band spreading for a multisubscriber environment and certain envisaged ATC systems deemed necessary for future traffic growth that could benefit materially from acoustic technology."
"Surface elastic wave bandpass filter techniques have been applied to the development of a minaturized frequency synthesizer for satellite communications systems. A bandpass filter centered at 247 MHz has been developed exhibiting less than 7-dB insertion loss over a 6-MHz 1-dB band, with sidelobe rejection greater than 45 dB."
"A generalized FM method of obtaining bandpass filters using surface-wave delay lines is discussed. Two identical FM transducers are used as input and output. The FM function of the transducers is determined by the required passband."
"A programmable surface acoustic wave (SAW) matched filter for biphase-coded spread spectrum waveforms has been constructed using a temperature-stable ST-cut quartz tapped delay line (TDL) and silicon-on-sapphire integrated control circuits. Construction is hybrid with wire stitch bond interconnections between the acoustic and microelectronic portions of the device. The SAW TDL operates at 120-MHz center frequency with 100-ns spacing between adjacent taps for a 10-MHz chip rate. The output of each tap can be individually switched to a load with 0 or 180/spl deg/ phase shift by the silicon-on-sapphire integrated control circuits. The high-speed capability of silicon-on-sapphire integrated circuits allows programming (code changing) to be achieved with a serial data input at 10-MHz rates, while the low temperature coefficient of ST-cut quartz allows satisfactory operation over a wide temperature range (-25/spl deg/C to +85/spl deg/C)."

 "Pseudonoise sequences can be generated by using a surface acoustic wave delay line in place of a shift register. Modulo-2 addition is achieved by combining the outputs of two transducers and using envelope detection. A 31-bit pseudonoise sequence was generated with a bit period of 1.1 /spl mu/s."

"Improved expressions are derived for the microwave fields scattered by a uniform electric-field incident on and parallel to a round metal post, with gap, in waveguide and in two related structures. A pair of variational expressions are found for the scattering and for the gap reactance under even excitation. The results are compared with those due to Lewin, and with data in the Waveguide Handbook."
"Gain-bandwidth limitations of broad-band single-stage microwave transistor amplifiers are related to a simple transistor circuit model, to constraints on characteristic impedance in a distributed-element equalizer, and to the line lengths of this equalizer. The gain-bandwidth performance of commensurate distributed-element equalizers is compared with the performance of a lumped-element equalizer, and four distributed-element design examples are presented, including two commensurate equalizers and two computer-optimized networks."
"A thorough investigation is made on the frequency-dependent properties of a varactor diode loss resistance at UHF. The variation of the losses with frequency in a varactor diode mounted cavity has been theoretically investigated, and it is shown that the previously reported inverse-squared frequency dependence of the varactor loss resistance can be attributed to the distributed cavity losses transformed across the varactor diode. A new measurement technique is introduced in which the circuit losses are first matched to the input line instead of the varactor loss resistance as an application of the relative impedance method. Measurements carried out with this technique for five different varactor diodes showed that the loss resistances of these diodes are not frequency dependent. It is also shown that the choice of the varactor diode capacitance plays an important role on the parametric amplifier noise temperature at UHF. In an experimental parametric amplifier the effect of varactor diode capacitance on the noise temperature has been demonstrated. It has been theoretically and experimentally shown that, generally, varactor diodes having higher capacitances result in better noise temperature at UHF."
"A moment method with mixed basis functions is introduced. In this formulation, modal basis functions are used for the expansion of the currents corresponding to the scattered propagating modes, while pulse basis functions are used for the expansion of the current corresponding to the scattered envancescent waves. This, together with the Dirac /spl delta/ weighting functions, reduces the number of total basis functions needed while retaining the simplicity and versatility of the method to cover junctions of an arbitrary shape. This method is applied to study examples of homogeneous and inhomogeneous waveguide junctions of parallel-plate waveguide propagating TE waves. It is found that for junctions that are not electrically large the convergence of the solutions is good. An appendix is included to transform and quicken the numerical integration of the modal basis functions."
"The integral equations governing the electrostatics of the excess charge distribution near microstrip rightangle bends, T junctions, and crossings are formulated and subsequently solved by a projective method. Extensive discontinuity capacitances are presented in graphical form. Where possible, the data are compared to the available experimental results."
"To have a full understanding of the experimental behavior of a junction circulator it is necessary to be able to measure the gyrator conductance, the susceptance slope parameter, and the frequencies of the two split resonant modes of the junction. It is also useful to be able to construct mode charts to determine the geometry of the device. The purpose of this short paper is to give simple methods by which each of these parameters may be measured in the case of the below-resonance stripline circulator. The techniques developed here all stem from the scattering and immittance matrices of the device. They are therefore quite general. They also require no phase information which makes them ideally suitable for reflectometer-type measurement. All measurements described here are made in the input transmission line of the device with the other two ports connected to similar transmission lines terminated in their characteristic impedance. The results obtained here apply to Iossless circulators for which the two resonant modes are symmetrically split by the magnetic field, and for which the frequency variation of the third mode can be omitted."
"The end effects of an open-circuited TEM transmission line make the line electrically longer than its physical length. In this short paper a half-wave resonator of a balanced strip transmission line has been analyzed and the required foreshortening of the line to achieve a prescribed resonance frequency has been calculated. Also the decrease in the characteristic impedance of the stripline caused by the end effects has been determined. The theory is in reasonably good agreement with measurements performed, especially for narrow stripline resonators."
"A simple rule is presented for the determination of the locking region of an oscillator with a general tuning circuit."
"A symmetrical 3-dB quadrature hybrid, consisting chiefly of a bifilar pair of twisted wires, is described. A cascade of two such hybrids can achieve an octave bandwidth with a 0.7-dB coupling error. Since this class of hybrid is simple, compact, and low in cost, its use may be preferred over the more common coaxial line or printed-circuit types in the frequency region below 1 GHz."
"The energy relations and the constitutive relations pertaining to a nonlinear transmission line are examined in detail. It is concluded that mathematical models which have been used in certain studies and which lead to the paradox concerning energy dissipation in the shock front are inadmissible. Correct models are free from such paradoxes. The work leads to the formulation of the hypothesis of realization: it is impossible to realize a continuous loss-free transmission medium which would be characterized by nonlinear distributed inductance L(I) and capacitance C(V), unless the medium is dispersive."
"The electromagnetic characteristics of a P-I-N switching window mounted in a resonant iris are derived. The results are used to evaluate tradeoffs between these windows and silicon switching windows mounted across the entire waveguide."
"Loss calculations have been performed to yield useful data relevant to the complementary odd and even modes propagating along a pair of identical coupled microstrip lines. The calculations are based on methods applied to the single-line case and indicate substantial differences in attenuation occurring between the odd and even modes for particular geometries."
"Experiments on an X-band four-mirror ring resonator are described. Measured frequency spacing and quality factor values are given. Clockwise and counterclockwise circulating modes are excited with different amplitudes. Fundamental mode patterns are shown across the circulating beam and across a mirror. They indicate that such modes are similar to those of a two-mirror Fabry-Perot (FP) resonator."
"An experimental study of dielectric beam waveguides with minimized dielectric structure is presented. Such structures are derived from the square-frame beam waveguide described elsewhere. The experimental results show that even very much reduced structures maintain guiding properties. In particular, the helix structure results are competitive with the complete-frame beam waveguide."

"An experimental study of pulsed transferred-electron oscillators operating in waveguide circuits is reported. Quenched-domain mode operation is shown to be present for short (less than 20-/spl mu/m) supercritically doped GaAs samples operating at X-band frequencies (8.2-12.4 GHz) and for bias-voltage values up to six times threshold value. Analysis of the waveguide circuit shows that the chip sees a parallel resonant circuit, and theoretical computations with a sinusoidal voltage waveform are shown to be reasonably accurate. The load admittance presented to the chip is experimentally evaluated."
"It has been found experimentally that the conventional optimization of waveguide tapers for the interconnection of circular waveguides with different diameters fails if the ratio in the diameters becomes too large. With the aid of an accurate numerical analysis program, the reason for the failure was found to be the reconversion from the unwanted mode to the main mode, which is neglected in all known synthesis procedures. The performance of tapers can be considerably improved by the implementation of other design equations and establishing new design criteria. This results in somewhat longer tapers. Various tapers were designed according to these procedures for a maximum of -40-dB H/sub 02/-mode level between 40 and 110 GHz, and preliminary measurements on fabricated units substantiate the improvement. It is further shown that the mode conversion at cutoff does not exhibit any singularity."
"The inductances of finite-length strips over a ground plane are calculated by the Galerkin method. The formulation is in terms of the quasi-static skin-effect equation. The numerical technique used is discussed and sample results are presented."
"An analysis is given of a lower sideband up-converter which includes a finite circuit reactance X/sub 33/ at the upper sideband frequency, in addition to the circuit impedances at the input signal and output lower sideband frequencies. The expressions developed for the gain, gain sensitivity to pump power variation, and noise figure show the extent to which gain and gain sensitivity decrease, and noise figure increases when X/sub 33/ is finite, as compared to the case when X/sub 33/ is infinite. For a simple circuit configuration the gain-bandwidth product changes markedly when X/sub 33/ is small at the center frequency. In addition, when second-harmonic pump power is allowed to flow through the varactor diode, the performance of the lower sideband up-converter can be improved."
"In this paper an exact field theory treatment for the waveguide junction circulators is presented. The treatment is general, being dependent on neither the geometrical symmetry of the junction nor the number of ports. The electromagnetic fields in the joining waveguides are written in the form of infinite summation of waveguide modes. The solutions of the wave equations in the ferrite rod and in the surrounding air are obtained in the form of infinite summation of cylindrical modes. The fields at the ferrite air interface and at an imaginary boundary chosen arbitrarily between the air region and the waveguides are then matched. This process leads to an infinite system of nonhomogeneous equations in the field amplitudes. Three types of waveguide junction circulators using this technique are analyzed: the simple ferrite-rod Y junction, the simple ferrite-rod T junction, and the latching Y junction. Point-matching techniques are used to get numerical results for the field distributions and the circulator characteristics. Excellent agreement has been found between the published experimental measurements and the numerical results obtained by this technique."
"The problem of electromagnetic-wave propagation in junctions between two symmetrically, partially dielectric-filled waveguides was investigated, and the solution is presented in the form of a two-port equivalent circuit, This equivalent circuit includes an ideal 1:1 transformer, which is connected to transmission lines with impedances equal to those of the two waveguides, in cascade with a T network. Elements of the T network and the characteristic wave impedances of these partially dielectric-filled waveguides have been studied, and the results are presented in graphs for different dielectric constants, slab thicknesses, and operating frequencies."
"Modeling of special configurations in microstrip becomes very important where computer-aided design is to be used. In order to develop the full capacity of the Gunn diode, the circuit must be understood. The following presentation concerns development of a model for a diode package mounted in a shunt configuration so that impedances can be referred to the semiconductor chip."
"The impedance and scattering properties of a perfectly conducting strip above a dielectric-coated conducting plane is investigated both theoretically and experimentally. An integral equation for the induced current is presented and solved numerically using a point-matching technique. The values of the reflection and transmission coefficients are calculated from the computed current distributions. The results of the computations are compared to the measured values and the agreement is quite good. In addition the impedance and fractions of power reflected, radiated, and transmitted are computed and displayed graphically."
"The design of microwave amplifiers with GaAs FET's assumes the knowledge of the four gain and the four noise parameters as a function of the biasing conditions. The gain parameters at three different bias conditions have been calculated by computer from the measured scattering parameters. The noise figures as a function of the same bias conditions have also been measured. The four fundamental noise parameters have been determined. The GaAs FET's are units from Plessey (England). At present, these are the only units which are commercially available."
 "Magnetically tunable resonators have been constructed in microstrip on a ferrite substrate. A large tuning range is obtained with an external magnetic field applied in the direction of the RF propagation, 17 MHz/Oe for magnetic fields from 0 to 30 Oe. A variable frequency microstrip oscillator which uses this effect is described; measurements made on an X-band IMPATT oscillator illustrate a tuning range from 9.4 to 10.5 GHz with an output power of 330 mW /spl plusmn/ 0.5 dB."
"A chromium-doped rutile traveling-wave maser utilizing simultaneously two signal frequency transitions has been designed and a prototype section tested."
"An approach to the solution of the equivalent electrical length, and the additional capacitance, associated with a right-angled bend in microstrip line are outlined. The calculations were performed under static assumptions, corresponding to a quasi-TEM mode of propagation of the fields. Although little theoretical work existed for comparison at the time of writing, encouraging reinforcement was gained with experimental results cited from the literature."

"A new synthesis technique for providing precise design values for the realization of broad-band parametric amplifiers incorporating practical varactor diode models is presented. The method provides the designer considerable flexibility in choosing the topology of matching networks employed. An integral part of the synthesis scheme is the application of a least-squares optimization procedure which employs exact partial derivatives of the objective function. The partial derivatives are used in the optimization to compute the gain sensitivity of the amplifier with respect to all matching network and diode parameters. For the first time, sensitivity data is presented which quantitatively shows the effect of the device and matching network parameter variations on overall amplifier response. This permits the determination of critical parameters and provides a means for establishing tolerances for various circuit parameters. In comparison with conventional procedures, significantly improved broad-band designs are shown to result."
"The design of an octave-band (2.5-5.0-GHZ) switched-line diode phase shifter is described. An analysis showing the need for a choice of the shunt-diode switch configuration for broad-band operation is presented. Curves of even- and odd-mode impedance of parallel coupled microstrip lines employed in Schiffman differential phase shifters are presented. The configuration and performance characteristics of the phase shifter are described,"
"The theory of wave propagation on Iossless multiconductor transmission lines with inhomogeneous dielectrics is developed using matrix analysis. The treatment is concise and complete and has the advantage of identifying propagation modes in a way that permits straightforward physical interpretation. The equivalent circuit for the general line is derived and its application to the solution of wave problems with reflections is demonstrated. Special consideration is given to the problem of characteristically terminating a multiconductor line, i.e., terminating without reflections. The realizability of such a characteristic termination network is discussed, and proofs of realizability are given for the important cases of all lines with homogeneous dielectrics and all three-conductor lines, regardless of dielectric inhomogeneities. Symmetric three-conductor lines are discussed to exemplify the general theory, and an application to the problem of mode conversion on symmetric and asymmetric shielded strip lines is given."
"The attenuation in a waveguide partially filled with absorbing material can become larger than that of the same waveguide completely filled with that same material. Theoretical and experimental results are presented together with field distributions showing that this excess loss is due to a large concentration of electric field within the lossy dielectric in the partially filled configuration."
"The modal analysis method is used to calculate the reflection and transmission properties of a thick rectangular window centrally located in a rectangular waveguide. Excellent agreement is obtained between calculated and measured values for windows of intermediate thickness. For thicker windows made of finitely conducting materials, the results obtained using perfectly conducting waveguide modes are inaccurate. However, by modifying the modes so as to include some of the mode-coupling effects caused by the surface currents, good agreement between calculated and measured data is obtained for a very thick, finitely conducting window."
"A new method based on slow microwave transients due to steep bias-voltage steps gives a detailed negative-device-conductance function versus microwave-voltage amplitude V/sub ac/ for Gunn diodes. Measurements of GaAs and InP devices made by different fabrication processes as used by a variety of manufacturers show that basic differences in behavior exist. Some of these are representative of high switching speeds and others of good steady-state efficiencies. Computer simulation of Gunn devices with a range of mobility and ionized-donor density profiles oscillating in a suitable resonant structure leads to similar differences in negative-conductance functions. A first correlation between experimental and theoretical behavior is attempted, and it is possible to estimate the mobility and carrier-density profiles which could most likely be responsible for a certain device behavior. It is shown that an external locking signal affects the device's negative conductance only for small values of V/sub ac/, and experimental results confirm that this, in accordance with theoretical expectation, increases the switching speed only of certain types of diodes."
"Experimental data are presented to describe various characteristics of stabilized transferred-electron amplifiers. The effect of bias voltage upon RF gain and linearity is shown. The conditions under which gain expansion is observed are described, and the importance of lattice temperature and RF signal strength in determining dc current is shown. All results are shown to be in good agreement with the large-signal theory for these amplifiers."
"A hybrid junction consisting of two mutually perpendicular rectangular waveguides, the broader side of one rotated through /spl pi//2, connected orthogonally to a circular waveguide, has been designed and its properties studied. The junction has many useful applications as a variable power divider, duplexer, tuner, and an element of an impedance bridge."
"A derivation for the image impedance of a microstrip line with one basic meander is presented. This shows a bandpass characteristic. A new simple technique is followed in designing a two-meander line on a G500 ferrite substrate. Scattering measurements (S-band) made on a model show excellent agreement with theory. Measured nonreciprocal differential phase shift is shown."
"A universal mode chart for the microstrip ring resonator, based on a radial waveguide model, is presented. The resonant frequency is related to the width of the ring conductor. Experimental results from 4 to 16 GHz are shown to be in good agreement with the theory."
"A successive extrapolated relaxation (SER) technique has been developed to solve elliptic partial difference equations iteratively. SER is more efficient than optimized successive over-relaxation (SOR) and permits useful solutions of waveguide modes using finite difference methods."
"Highly stabilized IMPATT oscillators at millimeter wavelengths have been developed. The IMPATT diode is mounted in the coaxial-waveguide circuit at the detuned open position, and is series-resonant at the design frequency. The frequency stability and power output of /spl plusmn/5x10/sup -5/ / /spl plusmn/20/spl deg/C and 50 mW,, respectively, have been obtained at 80 GHz."
"The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation (NTT) plans to make a field test for the practical application of the 20-GHz radio-relay transmission system. This short paper describes channel multiplexing-demultiplexing networks fabricated for use in this test. Overall loss of the network constructed by three stages, namely, a Vertical-horizontal (V-H) polarizing filter, a transmit-receive filter, and a channel-dropping filter, is 5 dB, even though a 2-dB loss of a flexible waveguide is included."
"Matrix methods are used to analyze the properties of covered microstrip. The Green's function is calculated by a potential theory method assuming the TEM mode of propagation. Computed impedance values of covered microstrip agree closely with other experimental and theoretical data. The technique is a general one and can be used to treat multiple-layer and covered microstrip."
"The boundary value problem associated with the open microstrip line structure is formulated in terms of a rigorous, hybird-mode representation. The resulting equations are subsequently transformed, via the application of Galerkin's method in the spectral domain, to yield a characteristic equation for the dispersion properties of the open microstrip line. Numerical results are included for several different structural parameters. These are compared with other available data and with some experimental measurements."
"A TE-mode planar transmission line is analyzed. It has a cross section as a ridged waveguide where the ridges are very thin. It is easily fabricated by photoetching of copper-clad dielectric boards, but can also be made without dielectrics for low-loss applications. Thus, it can be integrated together with other planar transmission lines like, for example, striplines. Besides the simplicity in feeding by stripline, the guide can be made smaller than an ordinary rectangular waveguide. It has applications in filters, resonators, balun-transitions, antenna feeds, etc. The characteristic impedance of the transmission line and its free-space cutoff wavelength are calculated and given in a diagram."
"The difference in the ionization rates of holes and electrons in Si results in different properties of n+-p-p+ and p+-n-n+ TRAPATT diodes. An approximate analysis is presented which shows these differences and indicates superior performance in the n+-p-p+ structure."

"The impulse response of acoustic surface-wave (ASW) filters is determined by the configuration of an array of planar transducers tapping the acoustic signal propagated in the piezoelectric substrate. The transducer configuration is derived here by applying the generaI procedure used for the synthesis of linear transversal filters, which consists in time sampling the required impulse response and arranging the spacing and weights of the taps according to the time intervals and amplitudes of the impulse-response samples. The design of the tapping structure that synthesizes the impulse response of ASW transversal filters is based on a nonuniform sampling procedure, previously developed by the authors, that meets the particular requirements of ASW device operation. The features of this design procedure are presented, and several geometries of tapping transducers corresponding to impulse responses of different characteristics are discussed. The application of the procedure to the design of typical ASW filters is illustrated by the results of experimental models."
"A generalized design approach is presented for ladder networks consisting of a cascade of constituent two-port networks connected by short lengths of transmission lines. The design is made possible by the derivation of simple equations which define the inverter impedance and associated reference planes of any passive lossless reciprocal two-port. This enables the general ladder network to be equated to a prototype network at a reference frequency. An example is given of the design of a coaxial low-pass filter where fringing capacitances are compensated automatically."
"Several new synthesis techniques are described for the design of tapered corrugated waveguide low-pass filters. Previous techniques are based on image-parameter methods which are both nonoptimum and difficult to apply to new specifications. The new synthesis methods give filters which can be constructed to work directly from dimensions generated by a computer. The impedance tapering implies that the terminating impedance transformers used in the image-parameter designs may be either eliminated or reduced in length."
"The frequency response of quarter-wave coupled reciprocal 3-port symmetrical junctions for which the reference eigennetwork appears as a short circuit at the reference terminals is presented. The equivalent circuit of such reciprocal junctions is constructed in terms of the reciprocal parts of the split admittance eigenvalues of the ideal 3-port circulator. Since the two circuits are related, the element values selected for the matching networks are the ones which apply to an ideal circulator with an overall Chebyshev response. This is done for n=1, 2, and 3. An important conclusion of this paper is that the design of wideband circulators is closely related to the design of wideband reciprocal 3-port junctions. The paper includes experimental results obtained on a stripline device in its magnetized and demagnetized states."
"Silvester's high-order finite-element formulation for potential problems is extended to enable the analysis of acoustic wave propagation in lossless isotropic, uniform, and inhomogeneous guiding structures. The formulation allows a large class of problems to be solved using elements of any desired order, with only minimal computer coding. Three examples are cited---one involving a simple homogeneous region having an analytic solution, and two inhomogeneous problems. Good agreement with other methods and with limiting cases is obtained in each case."
"An analysis is presented of the propagation characteristics of some waveguide latching ferrite phaser structures useful for high average power applications. Calculated results show the effects on the loss and differential phase shift of adding vertical slab or T-shaped cooling structures of dielectrics, such as beryllium oxide and boron nitride. Typical design data are presented."
"A low-noise balanced down-converter for microwave radio-link applications is described. Down-converters of this type have been realized with typical noise figures of 3.5 dB at 4 GHz, 4 dB at 7 GHz, and 5 dB at 13 GHz. These results are obtained mainly by taking into account high order sideband frequencies of the pump harmonics up to the third, by properly terminating the image frequency, by matching the input port of the mixer and by optimizing the mixer-preamplifier interface. The experimental results are compared with the theoretical ones obtainable with ideal purely resistive diodes."
"Some of the restrictions imposed on general 5-port junctions (or networks) by losslessness and reciprocity are discussed as well as considerations of restrictions due to physical symmetry. It is proven that if a lossless reciprocal 5-port junction (or network) is completely matched, then all off-diagonal elements of the scattering matrix are nonzero; i.e., if the junction is matched, no port is decoupled from any of the others. It is also shown that all off-diagonal scattering coefficients of a lossless reciprocal 5-port junction (or network) have a magnitude of one half if and only if the junction is completely matched. Those physical symmetries which preclude complete matching of 5-port junctions are given and a general theorem concerning the matching of junctions and physical symmetry is proven."
"Using the Frankel-Young method, fast estimation of the potential distribution for a microstrip structure is obtained when an accelerating factor /spl omega/ is introduced in the finite-differences (relaxation) method. It is possible to calculate such a factor by an iterative technique, but the time of computation needed to find /spl omega/ annihilates the theoretical gain. In this short paper, the authors present a method which gives an analytical expression for /spl omega/. The realistic case examined here, as an illustration, is that of the suspended microstrip couplers for which odd and even impedances are the interesting parameters. Given an analytical expression for /spl omega/, the overrelaxation method appears as a very powerful and attractive method for finding the solution of any type of microstrip structure."
"In a recent short paper, a method for constructing solutions to the classical uniform multiwire transmission-line equations was given which was intended to include the case of partial eigenvalue degeneracy. This development appears to be incorrect and a correct development will be given. In addition, a complete method for constructing the matrix chain parameters of a section of line will be presented."
"The surface-to-bulk wave conversion phenomena occurring at a discontinuity characterized by a surface contour deformation may be used as a means for tapping Rayleigh waves in a nonpiezoelectric solid. For this purpose, the mode conversion problem is treated in this short paper with the use of a boundary perturbation technique. A systematic procedure is obtained to calculate not only the first-order scattered waves which include the reflected surface wave and the converted bulk wave, but also the higher order terms. With careful design of the surface contour, the converted bulk-wave power and the direction of propagation into the substrate may be controlled."
"Measurements on MIC dielectrics have been made by applying the theory of resonant cavities to either wholly or partly metallized substrates. Two different schemes of coupling are employed, depending upon the metallization. Errors occur in the derived value of /spl epsi/, due to the coupling, and are of opposite sense for the two methods discussed. They may be averaged to improve the overall measurement precision (0.5 percent)."
"The equivalent electrical lengths of uniform microstrip line associated with an abrupt impedance step are first evaluated, under static assumptions. The importance of these results in establishing a reference plane for the step, and in the application of calculations of capacitance associated with the step, is then demonstrated. Furthermore, some interesting dualities are discerned from the results."
"This calculation provides a lower bound (complementing the upper bound solution given earlier) to the discontinuity capacitance of a coaxial line terminated in a circular waveguide. A 50-/spl Omega/ 0.9525-cm (3/4-in) open-circuited coaxial termination with a solid center conductor was fabricated with center- and outer-conductor diameters of 0.82723 /spl plusmn/ 0.00005 and 1.90487 /spl plusmn/ 0.00005 cm (1 cm=0.393703 in), respectively. The measured value of capacitance of this termination at 1000 Hz was 216.4 /spl plusmn/1.0 fF, as compared with the calculated lower bound of 215.0 fF. (The upper bound for this case was 217.7 fF.)"
"A method is given for determining the characteristic equations and field components of the LSE and LSM modes in rectangular waveguides filled with a dielectric which is inhomogeneous in one transverse dimension. The method is exact and yields solutions for a nearly arbitrary variation in permittivity across the waveguide."

"A theoretical and experimental study of the electromagnetic resonances of spheres is presented. In particular, the scattering characteristics of spheres inside rectangular waveguides are investigated at and around the resonant frequencies. The approach is based on the scattering theory developed by Mie in 1908. Mie's theory is valid for scattering of a plane electromagnetic wave by a homogeneous and isotropic sphere of arbitrary diameter. It encompasses both lossless and lossy spheres. Three continuous functions of frequency are presented. They contain information on the resonant frequencies, the Q-factors, and the output power losses of the sphere. The effect of losses on the resonant behavior was also studied. The theoretical results were compared to experimental data. The agreement between theory and experiment is excellent. An experimental study of the effect of inhomogenities and irregularities of the sphere's material and shape was also made."
"An investigation of the end effect in a shorted-slot line is described. It is shown that the apparent position of the short is a small fraction of a wavelength beyond the end of the slot. The reactance seen at the end of the slot is, therefore, inductive. Experimental curves are presented which show normalized inductive reactance versus frequency for substrates with /spl epsi//sub r/ =12 and /spl epsi//sub r/=20 for several slot widths."
"Formulas and curves are given for the phase constant of slot line with metal-coating thickness greater than zero. Change in the phase constant is about a 1-percent decrease even though metal-coating thickness is 2 percent of the slot width."
"The nature of mechanical and electronic (varactor) tuning characteristics of \"electromechanically\" tuned Gunn oscillators in waveguide and coaxial configurations has been investigated and their interactions studied. Some general conclusions about the family of electromechanically tuned Gunn oscillators have been drawn and their limitations pointed out. It is suggested that these limitations are imposed by a distributed circuit on a point source."
"Two new types of quasi-optical waveguide-polarization diplexers are described. They are based on the use of a metal grating, or a dielectric plate at Brewster's angle, placed in an oversize circular 3-port junction. Their performances are measured at a wavelength of 4.28 mm in a standard microwave circuit and at 337/spl mu/m with the HCN laser beam."
"A theoretical and experimental investigation is being made of a modified form of H guide as a possible guided wave structure for millimeter and submilliieter wavelengths. The effects of channels in the conducting planes to support a dielectric film has been studied by scaled-up models at 3-cm wavelength. Low losses, even at the shorter wavelengths, are predicted. The channels may be used to filter unwanted higher order modes, and the use of high-permittivity dielectric is suggested to further reduce the guide attenuation."
 "A frequency-independent small-signal equivalent circuit for an IMPATT diode is proposed. It incorporates five circuit elements, including a negative resistance, and is valid over an octave range of frequency. With the addition of two white noise sources it also serves as a noise equivalent circuit."
"Conformal mapping calculations of impedance and effective dielectric constant are presented for coplanar waveguide (CPW) lines with finite-substrate thickness. These calculations and experimental data show a departure from the intinite dielectric approximation as the substrate thickness approaches the guide slot width. The quasi-TEM approximation is retained and calculations of static energy density within the substrate are given. This approximation agrees well with field calculations using a finite-element solution to Laplace's equation."
"The assumptions required for the transient method of measuring Gunn-diode conductance are shown to be valid if either the diode susceptance or the characteristic admittance of the resonator transmission line are larger than the modulus of the negative conductance of the device."

"A previous result is extended and a new presentation is described for Richards' transmission-line (TL) networks. The new presentation is in a lumped LC form; therefore, classical analysis and synthesis techniques are directly applicable. The class of networks for which this presentation is possible is studied in detail. This class of networks, called normal TL networks, is found to be a necessary and sufficient condition for driving-point immittance functions to be rational positive real functions of /spl lambda/ =tanh /spl tau//spl rho/. The effectiveness of this representation is further demonstrated by applying it to graph-transformation analysis method. It simplifies the procedure considerably and reveals additional physical insight into the TL network."
"Using a new sine-plane approach, an easy-to-use design procedure for microwave filters is developed. The design formulas are very simple and are valid for filters of wide bandwidths. Furthermore, the new design offers many advantages over other presently available designs."
"The advantages of an admittance formalism for the derivation of performance characteristics of transversal filters and one-port information stores using acoustic surface-wave delay lines are described. An expression for the transadmittance between transducer pairs in the weak-coupling approximation is derived using a normal mode theory. The formulation is found to give good agreement with measurements of the passband response of a wide-band logarithmically frequency-tapered transducer pair on YX-quartz. A brief discussion of the limitations of the model is included."
"Experimental results of the nonlinear behavior of an IMPATT diode oscillator under free-running and bias-modulated conditions are presented and correlated with theoretical results. Amplitude and frequency behavior of a free-running IMPATT diode oscillator such as: 1) power-frequency characteristic, 2) jump and hysteresis, 3) temperature dependence, 4) harmonic content, and 5) electronic tuning characteristics are discussed. The bias-modulation properties and their relation to the free-running behavior are described. The effects of the operating point, external Q, and injection locking on the modulation properties are presented."
"The modal and eigenvalue approaches of 4-port single-junction circulators are combined to describe the theory and construction, of a waveguide device and a stripline device. The three independent variables used in the case of the waveguide one are a pair of HE/sub spl plusmn1,1,1/ open dielectric resonances in a demagnetized ferrite disk, a TM/sub 0,1,1/ resonance on a metal post, and the magnitude of a direct field to remove the degeneracy between the HE/sub spl plusmn1,1,1/ modes. The eigenvalue approach is used to establish systematically each condition one at a time. The variables used in the construction of the stripline junction are a pair of radial n= /spl plusmn/3 degenerate resonances, a radial n=0 resonance, and the amplitude of a direct field to split the degeneracy between the former modes. In this case a circulation condition is found in which it is possible to omit one of the circulation adjustments."
"Power conversion coefficients and the launch phase of propagating modes excited by a symmetric step-discontinuity in circular waveguide are accurately predicted by a modal analysis of the discontinuity which includes only a few evanescent modes. The relative power in transmitted and reflected propagating modes is presented as a function of normalized frequency for two step-discontinuity ratios to indicate typical solution results."
"The Q factor of an open-circuited resonator is influenced by dielectric, conductor, and radiation losses. This short paper discusses these losses and shows that insight into the radiation loss can be obtained by an extension to the analysis given by Lewirt. This shows that the radiation loss is a maximum for the dominant mode and that provided the permittivity is not less than 9.0 the radiation losses are at a minimum for the second mode. It is suggested that these results may be applied to the design of filters based on dielectric resonators. The application of the results to stripline resonators in which the dielectric extends past the termination of the upper conducting strip is more difficult, and it is suggested that experimental work is required to investigate postulated improvements. Finally, some of the radiation patterns of the open-circuited dielectric resonators, obtained in this paper, show interesting directional properties which may be applied to the design of antenna systems."
"In order to solve the waveguide junction problem numerically, we express the fields in the guides by truncated modal expansions and construct an error function which is a measure of the mean-square error in the matching of the boundary conditions at the junction. The minimum of this error leads to a set of linear equations for the modal amplitudes. Offset rectangular waveguides with amplitude and current excitations are studied. A weighting factor which multiplies the error contribution due to the magnetic field is studied, and a criterion for its selection given."
"An investigation of the dependence of slot-line wavelength upon a thin layer of adhesive between metal and substrate is described. It is shown that the presence of adhesive will cause an increase in wavelength when the dielectric constant of the adhesive is less than that of the substrate. Experimental results are presented which show this dependence for a variety of surfaces and adhesives. A perturbation expression is given which permits correction of experimental data for comparison with theory when this effect occurs."
"It is well known that the fringing capacitances determined for rectangular bars between parallel plates interact with each other when w/(b -t)/spl rarr/0. The limit of this interaction as s/spl rarr/0 for fixed w, b, and t is determined for symmetrical odd-mode fringing capacitances. This limit, together with an exact value known from one rectangular section and the known asymptotic value as s/spl rarr/ 0, permits one to estimate the values for all s. The same is true for the interaction of the symmetrical even-mode fringing capacitances, except that their interaction is readily shown to tend to zero as s/spl rarr/0."
"A swept frequency impedance indicator which consists of directional couplers and detectors is described. Experimental equipment was made at a 17.5-19.5-GHz band, and successfully operated."
"The experiment described demonstrates the applicability of MIS varactors in microwave power circuits. A frequency doubler with 55-percent overall efficiency and pulsed output power of 5.5 W at 5.4 GHz with a duty cycle of 50 percent has been built by using two MIS varactors in parallel. The multiplier has a coaxial low-pass filter at the input and a waveguide output, allowing a 3-dB bandwidth of 8 percent."
"Experimental tests performed on metallic frame beam waveguides are described. Two types of metallic structures have been considered. The first one constituted by thin annular frames has the same attenuation value as that of an iris beam waveguide (infinite slit) of the same aperture, but presents guiding properties which are polarization sensitive. The second type of a more complex structure is essentially a dielectric frame beam waveguide in which the dielectric of suitable refraction index is simulated by metallic parallel plate waveguide sections."
"The increase in TE/sub 11/-TM/sub 01/ mode bandwidth obtained by inhomogeneously loading (dielectric lining) a circular waveguide is systematically documented. Maximum bandwidth is about 31.83 percent of center frequency (up from about 26.54 percent for fully filled or empty circular waveguides). This makes circular waveguides competitive with square waveguides (bandwidth/spl aprox/ 34.3 percent) as radiators in wide-band dual-polarization arrays. Certain interesting symmetries involving the TE/sub 21/-TM/sub 01/ modal inversion are also examined."

The techniques are particularly oriented to computer-aided design. Useful topologies for realizing broad-band matching networks are provided. Measured performance data for a 13-W, 1010- to 1460-MHz stage are included. An assessment of broad-band utilization of two circuits is graphically undertaken in conjunction with the Bode constant-resistance integral theorem."
"The results of an investigation of the gain, stability, phase shift, power addition, saturation, and bandwidth properties of microwave reflection amplifiers which employ IMPATT diodes as the active element, together with the dependence of all these properties upon the device material, doping profile, and operating conditions, are presented. Both Si and GaAs diodes are considered and experimental results demonstrating the validity of the model are provided, together with other experimentally determined characteristics relating gain, saturation, and bandwidth to current density and tuning conditions. Finally, measurements illustrating the degradation of response as a result of subharmonic oscillation are given."
"A measurement and characterization technique is presented which allows design and realization of IMPATT amplifiers operating at maximum generation efficiency. Diodes mounted in a stable reduced-height waveguide circuit are characterized by their complex reciprocal scattering coefficient as a function of frequency, dc bias, and RF drive power level. In particular, terminal conditions which correspond to a maximum power exchange between the active one-port network and the source are identified and then used to design and realize controlled-gain maximum generation-efficiency amplifiers. Simple equalization networks are shown to provide a wide range of available amplifier gains between limits set by stability requirements. As an example, the technique is effectively used with silicon diodes at K/sub a/-band (33-40 GHz) to realize a 7-dB gain 250-mW power amplifier with 5-GHz bandwidth."
"A frequency-independent lumped equivalent circuit is proposed for characterizing the large-signal behavior of IMPATT diodes. It has five elements including a negative resistance, two of which are quadratic functions of the single-frequency RF voltage across the device. It is used for computer-aided analysis and the design of reflection-type negative-resistance amplifiers employing IMPATT diodes. The frequency response of the amplifier is calculated for different input power levels and the nature of the results is found to be in agreement with published experimental results."
"Nonlinear characteristics, large-signal effects, and transient response of IMPATT amplifiers are analyzed leading to clear understanding of various nonlinear and large-signal phenomena which are often observed experimentally on IMPATT diodes operated as stable (linear) amplifiers or injection-locked oscillators. Effects of bandwidth on transient response of the IMPATT amplifiers as applied to phase-modulated signals and amplitude-modulated signals are investigated in detail. The relationship between the transition (switching) time and the amplifier bandwidth is derived. Capabilities and limitations of IMPATT diodes operated as stable amplifiers or injection-locked oscillators are discussed."
"Experimental results obtained with millimeter-wave IMPATT amplifiers are presented. Nonlinear and large-signal characteristics of stable IMPATT amplifiers and injection-locked IMPATT oscillators are described. Amplifier circuit configuration, diode characteristics, and measured effects of bias current, temperature, and large-signal level on gain, bandwidth, power saturation, and phase-delay characteristics are discussed in detail."
"The system aspects and packaging of a two-stage FM IMPATT-diode amplifier are described. The amplifier combines the output power of 4 IMPATT diodes in the final stage to provide an output power of greater than 4 W at 6 GHz. The system has a locking bandwidth of greater than 200 MHz with a 16-dB gain and a noise figure of less than 50 dB. Both the design and the experimental performance of the amplifier and each of its stages are discussed. The noise characterization of IMPATT-diode amplifiers, operating as injection-locked oscillators or stable amplifiers, determined the mode of operation for each stage. Included in the paper are experimental results of large-signal noise characterization of both Si and GaAs IMPATT diodes, as are the noise characteristics related to the output power and gain."
"lMPATT-diode amplifiers with a power output of 1.0 W have been developed for use in an 11-GHz digital radio. Two types of amplifiers, a multistage reflection amplifier and a hybrid amplifier containing an injection-locked oscillator stage, have been evaluated by measuring the bit error rate degradation due to the amplifier. System test data show that the stable amplifier introduces little or no errors while the injection-locked oscillator (ILO) often introduces an error-rate floor."
"More than a 40-dB third-order intermodulation product (IMP) has been achieved in a 13-GHz-band 2-stage IMPATT stable amplifier with 21-dBm output level and 11-dB gain, using a diode bias-current compensation technique. Theoretical calculations also verified the experimental data. This technique will enable the IMPATT stable amplifier to be used in a multicarrier AM transmission system."
"Experimental data on phase characteristics as a function of ambient temperatures for GaAs IMPATT amplifiers are presented. An evaluation is given to show the impact of ambient temperature on an amplifier design used in phased-array RADARs."
"The results of investigations of the effect of parasitic package elements on the behavior of negative resistance amplifiers are presented. Three different package styles were considered. Also two different lead configurations were used. The packages were all mounted in 7-mm coaxial transmission line. The impedance of packages with and without leads was measured from 4 to 18 GHz using a manual network analyzer. These data were used as the basis for calculations to determine the values of elements in a simple three-element equivalent circuit model of the package. Using the equivalent circuit model experimentally derived for each package style, the impedance seen by the chip through the package to a 50-/spl Omega/ load was calculated. Broad-band curves of the impedance seen by the chip are presented. The experimentally derived model of the package permits matching of chip and package for stability."
"Linear reflection gain has been observed from a GaAs diode oscillating in the LSA mode with gain occurring at a frequency not harmonically related to the fundamental oscillation frequency. The characteristics of the amplifier are presented together with measurements of the circuit load as seen by the device. The mechanism of operation is also discussed."
"A possible explanation for a type of experimentally observed amplitude instability for amplifiers and locked oscillators is given. The results obtained are in good agreement qualitatively with measurements on IMPATT-diode amplifiers. The theory shows that the susceptsnce of the active element has to be amplitude dependent to create the actual type of instability."

"J.B. Horton, President of G-MTT, in his keynote address at the 1973 G-MTT International Microwave Symposium, outlined three directions which G-MTT and the microwave industry should take for future growth. A summary of his talk is presented. Horton urged listeners to proceed as follows: 1) Emphasize new and broader based applications of conventional microwave techniques with emphasis on socialtechnological applications. 2) Integrate solid-state technology with microwave techniques, with emphasis on wide-band components at millimeterwave frequencies. During the 70's one can expect continuing advances in these solid-state components. For example, one can predict that within the next five years we will have IMPATT diodes capable of generating 100 mW at 250 GHz, varactor diodes with 2000-GHz cutoff frequencies, and field-effect transistors fully operational as low noise devices and power devices at X band. Finally, 3) he proposes that engineers begin to seriously look at submillimeter and optical frequencies to develop components for future high data rate systems. By high data rate, he means systems that require 40-50-GHz signal bandwidth."
  "The relationship between microwave techniques and the growing concern for future sources of energy is reviewed. The relationship is specifically explored in the use of a microwave beam to efficiently transport power from an array of solar photovoltaic cells in space to the earth's surface. The transition from a laboratory technology of microwave power transmission to a 10-GW 23 200-mi transmission system is examined in detail."
"A general discussion of military applications of integrated optics and fiber optics is presented. Specific applications discussed are: 1) a multiterminal multiplexed data highway for aircraft and shipboard use; 2) optical fibers as tethers; 3) a 10.6-/spl mu/m heterodyne detector; and 4) integrated optical phased arrays."
"The possibilities of using the magnetic Faraday effect to provide a planar dielectric waveguide isolator or circulator are studied. At least two active elements which couple the TE and TM waveguide modes are required. One of these is magnetooptic. Preliminary design data for a dielectric waveguide isolator in which the mode-converting media forms the substrate and top layer of a single waveguide structure are reported. This design should prove more practical than the optical tandem structures proposed previously."
"Periodic structures are used widely in integrated optics for input-output couplers, bandstop filters, modulators, directional couplers, and distributed feedback lasers. An analytical discussion and review of these devices is given based upon the coupled-mode transmission-line analysis. Experimental results and performance characteristics are presented to illustrate the special features of each type of device. Finally, the usefulness of transmission-line analysis to the understanding and the design of these devices is pointed out."
"Magnetoplasma reflection-beam isolators for submillimeter-wave use are discussed in theory and experiment. The basic device uses the Kerr transverse magnetooptic effect (plane of polarization of the EM wave in the plane of incidence, which is perpendicular to a dc magnetic field) in InSb near room temperature. When the semiconductor slab is covered with a thin dielectric layer acting as a matching transformer, improved performance is predicted and observed at 337 /spl mu/m, and very efficient isolator performance is predicted for 118 /spl mu/m. Physical arguments are presented to explain the nonreciprocal phenomenon and lead to better device design."
"The induced fields and the associated power deposition in mail exposed to HF electromagnetic (EM) fields have been investigated theoretically using spherical models. The induced electric fields inside the model exposed to either plane wave or near fields can be described adequately by a combination of quasi-static electric and magnetic induction solutions. It is shown that for field impedances less than 1200/spl pi//spl Omega/ the magnetically induced energy absorption predominates. Therefore, H fields must be measured to obtain any estimate of the hazards due to HF exposure. For a 70-kg model of man exposed to a plane wave field, the theory indicates that the time-average power absorption per unit volume is less than 2.5x10/sup -3/ mW/g for each milliwatt per square centimeter incident at 20 MHz and below. This suggests that the thermal safe-exposure levels for the HF band are many orders of magnitude in excess of the 10-mW/cm/sup 2/ level recommended for the microwave region."
"A simple model to describe a nonlinear device or system is proposed which extends the power series expansion, conventionally restricted to amplitude nonlinearities, to include phase nonlinearities as well. Four different test methods are selected for which the experimentally observed nonlinearity parameters are related to the \"gain\" and \"phase\" coefficients of the extended series. A set of simplified relationships is derived where the \"1-dB gain compression point\" represents gain contributions only while phase nonlinearities are included in the \"intercept point,\" the \"third-order intermodulation (IM) coefficients,\" and the \"noise-power-ratio (npr).\" For a TWT amplifier in which phase nonlinearities dominate, the third-order IM coefficient was measured. The results are compared with those calculated from single-tone and noise-loading tests using the relationships derived from the model. Agreement to /spl plusmn/ 1 dB is found over a 15-dB power range."
"Instantaneous gain, noise figure, reverse attenuation, and gain and phase control measurements in the frequency range 8-18 GHz have been performed on GaAs traveling-wave transistors. The broad-band high-gain nature of the device together with the requirement for several bias connections precluded the use of standard test fixtures, and resulted in a package design exhibiting less than 1-dB insertion loss over the band together with 75- to 90-dB internal isolation. Untuned X-band gain, noise figure, and reverse attenuation were 12 dB, 18 dB, and 32 dB, respectively, and the gain and phase could be electronically varied over a 35-dB and 360/spl deg/ range. When RF tuning was employed, the gain, on the average, improved by 10 dB."
"High-power UHF transistors have been characterized through the use of large-signal S-parameters. These S-parameters have been used successfully to design UHF power amplifiers. Waveform measurements show that due to the Q of the package parasitic, most class C operated UHF power transistors have nearly sinusoidal waveforms at their package terminals. Experimental evidence presented shows that the large-signal S-parameters are relatively independent of power once the device is turned on. These two observations make it possible to extend modified small-signal S-parameter design techniques to large-signal power amplifiers."
"Two new alogrithms suitable for computer-aided optimization of networks are presented. They are both based on the nonlinear least /spl rho/th approximation approach, which has been successfully applied by the authors to microwave network design problems requiring minimax or near-minimax solutions. A basic difference here is that, instead of requiring very large values of /spl rho/, any finite value of /spl rho/, greater than 1 can be used to produce extremely accurate minimax solutions. This paper discusses a six-variable transformer example where values of /spl rho/ equal to 2, 4, 6, 10, 100, 1000, and 10 000 have all been used separately to obtain substantially the same solution. Both the adjoint network method for gradient evaluation and the Fletcher method are employed for greater efficiency. Comparisons with the razor search and grazer search methods are made. Some far-reaching observations concerning minimax design are also made."
"Spurious modes in multimode H-plane waveguide bends of nonuniform curvature are computed on the basis of rectangular and annular waveguide modal analyses. The sets of coupled differential equations for the wave amplitudes are solved numerically using both an iterative approach and the Runge-Kutta method. The advantages and limitations of the different approaches to this problem are considered in detail."
"The radiation field and mutual coupling between two identical parallel-plate waveguides having the same axis of symmetry are investigated. Jones' method of formulation is applied and a modified Wiener-Hopf equation is obtained. Expressions for the radiated field in free space, reflected field in the exciting waveguide, and transmitted field in the coupled waveguide are obtained and the reflected and transmitted fields are expressed in terms of waveguide modes. The reflection coefficient for each mode is represented by three terms, two of which are due to reflections at the open end of the exciting waveguide and are constant along the waveguide. The third term is the contribution from the field scattered by the open end of the coupled waveguide and decays along the waveguide according to the radiation condition. Similarly, the transmission coefficient of each mode is represented by three terms, two of which decay along the coupled waveguide and the third one is constant. The radiation field is also divided into three terms. One of them is due to the radiation from the open end of the exciting waveguide and the other two are the contribution of multiple interactions between the two waveguides. Computed results for the reflection and transmission coefficients and the radiation field are shown for TE/sub 0,1/ excitation and various separation distance of the waveguides. The results for the reflection and transmission coefficients are oscillating functions of period /spl pi/, and approach gradually the well-known final values of a single excited wavegnide."
"Continuous 960-MHz microwave irradiation of isolated poikilothermic hearts in Ringer's solution causes bradycardia, in contrast to the tachycardia usually produced by generalized heating. The effect appears to occur only over a narrow power range in the neighborhood of an estimated 3 mW absorbed by the heart. It is hypothesized that the bradycardia is produced by stimulation of the nerve remnants in the heart."
"In a pilot study to determine phosphor response after microwave exposure, a reduction in the expected amount of light emitted during thermoluminescent (TL) analysis was observed after exposure to microwave radiation of a phosphor preirradiated with cobalt-60 gamma radiation. Investigation of the thermoluminescent response of some high dielectric-constant materials after microwave exposure revealed the fading phenomenon in the powdered and ceramic states of the phosphors."
"Research has shown that the determination of absorbed microwave energy as well as the control of environmental parameters are important in relating biological-effect data to, radiation protection. This short paper describes the development of an environmentally controlled waveguide irradiation facility for the exposure of small animals to 2450-MHz CW microwave energy. Integral dose rate is determined without perturbing the microwave field interacting with the irradiated animal."
"The design of a high-power air-cooled microwave Y-junction circulator which is capable of operation at peak and average power levels of 800 kW and 800 W, respectively, is described. The unit is an H-plane waveguide circulator which is externally air cooled. The circulator design employs a full-height substituted YIG rod with a center metal pin together with boron nitride matching transformers. The circulator exhibits an insertion loss of less than 0.4 dB, isolation greater than 22 dB, and a VSWR <1.26:1 over a 400-MHz bandwidth centered at 3.3 GHz. At high-power levels, the device exhibits insertion loss of less than 0.9 dB, isolation greater than 20 dB, and VSWR <1.25:1 at an indicative frequency within the operating bandwidth."
"A new microwave structure is proposed, consisting of a circular waveguide loaded with two ferrite toroids circumferentially magnetized at remanence in opposite direction. It is shown that nonreciprocal parameters such as differential phase shift can be doubled with respect to the single toroid configuration. A method for biasing the toroids at remanence in opposite directions by means of a single wire passing through the axis of the waveguide is proposed. Modal purity is taken into account in order to select dielectric Ioading parameters which ensure operation within the modal inversion window in which the TE/sub 01/ mode is dominant. The propagation factor and differential phase shift are computed under these conditions, and their variation with several parameters such as remanent magnetization, toroid location, and toroid thickness is shown."
"The WR15 thermal noise standard that is used as the national reference standard of noise power in the frequency range from 56 to 64 GHz is described in this short paper. The source forms a basis for both the noise-power comparison service and noise-figure service offered by the National Bureau of Standards in this frequency range."
"A stationarity property for the resonant frequency of a rectangular cavity as a function of the thickness of a low-loss dielectric slab inserted within is used for the accurate determination of the microwave permittivity of the sample. The accuracy estimated to a few promille in X band has been confirmed by experimentation on a standard material."
"A theoretical analysis of several possible modes of molecular absorption of microwave radiation suggests that interference with some stereospecific biomolecular processes may result from microwave irradiation."

 "An automated system has been developed by the Industrial Engineering group at IBM's System Products Division plant in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., to TRACK the serialized bases of any product by comparing customized targets to actual labor claims. The system expedites identification of the specific factor that contributed to an overtarget situation. The concepts of TRACK, which consist of Fortran IV and PL/1 programs under OS, are being incorporated into a plant-wide programming system called ATLAS (Actual Target Labor Auditing System}."
"An important goal in the analysis of a sequential manufacturing process, such as the production of integrated circuits, is to identify those operations which have the greatest potential for cost reduction. One method for making this identification compares the existing production line to a target line composed of \"optimal\" operations and then allocating an appropriate portion of the difference in cost to each of the operations. For instance, you could choose a fixed sequence in which to optimize individual operations and assign to each operation the incremental cost recovered by its upgrading. However, because of the interdependence of manufacturing operations, this cost allocation may vary with the sequence selected. A method of eliminating this sequence-dependence is to average the cost allocation over the set of all possible upgrading sequences. Here we present an efficient method for computing these averaged allocations for a common type of manufacturing process."
 "This paper presents a survey of design problems associated with the implementation of computer control of discrete manufacturing processes. The two primary application requirements placed on the digital computers are identified and discussed; namely, the information system function and the equipment control system function. A tutorial survey is then given of three computer structures to implement control of manufacturing operations. The relative advantages and disadvantages of each of these systems are discussed, Finally a new structure is presented that uses a multilevel computer concept with satellite computers at the lowest level. A detailed view of the satellite computer, including hardware requirements, software requirements, and timing considerations, is given. Emphasis is placed on a modular design that meets the real-time needs at the most fundamental level of a manufacturing plant. Extensions are then given to computer requirements at upper levels, hardware and software configurations, and real-time versus interrupt capability."
"Current industrial practice and theory applicable to the fabrication of low-voltage p-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor (PMOS) devices is summarized. An extensive bibliography and design parameter graphs are presented."
"This paper collects together in one place detailed procedures for making microwave integrated circuits in high conductivity copper on sapphire, alumina, or quartz. The relative merits of the \"plate-through\" and \"etch-back\" techniques, where the processing uses only one layer of photoresist, have been examined by sectioning and lapping the stripline conductors that result from each method. From photographic evidence the first method is seen to yield linewidths slightly greater than the mask size due to the edge being sloped, or cambered. Thus, for example, a coupling gap between two adjacent conductors turns out smaller than it should. The opposite happens with the etch-hack method; the etched edge recedes under the photoresist image, so a coupling gap is enlarged. In contrast to the usual concept of \"undercutting\" this edge shows no slope but remains square. Finally, the metal deposit with plate-up sometimes is less uniform, depending upon the layout of components in the circuit pattern."
"This paper describes the role of a computer and group failure analysis techniques in performing component failure analysis for a large manufacturing facility. The computer permits the storage of information pertaining to all component failures, the manipulation of the information to show past and present failure trends, and the availability of each failed component. The group analysis technique allows for the maximum number of failures to be analyzed in a minimum amount of time per component, and it presents the failure data in a highly visible manner, helping to pinpoint failure causes."
 "The failure of closed contacts in insulating oil of elevated temperature was attributed hitherto to the formation of oil carbon in the contact interface. However, experiments have shown the formation of surface films before the development of oil carbon. Under the assumption that the reduction of the conducting area is following the experimentally determined film growth, it is possible to estimate contact life in dependence of various parameters using the characteristic values of the contact interface."
"The influence of the contact dimensions on the erosion behavior of copper contacts using a current ranging from i = I - 18 kA (50 Hz) has been investigated under insulating oil and in air. High-speed photographs of the arcs and photographs of the arc traces on the contact surfaces reveal that the formation of plasma streams, which is dependent on the current load and the dimension's ratio of the contact pair, have a decisive influence on contact erosion."
"Quadrupole mass spectrometry and Auger electron spectroscopy have not previously been used in combination for investigations of metal contact surface phenomena. These techniques are described here specifically for metal contact research and development. Phenomenological results obtained using these techniques in association with other ultrahigh vacuum facilities that are reported here are intrinsic contact contamination, metal transfer from arcing, growth of impurity carbon due to arcing, surface segregation, contact outgassing, field desorption, and contact environmental control. These techniques are the experimental part of an accompanying paper on the surface chemistry of contact materials."
"The changes in the microstructure, the composition, and the morphology of internally oxidized Ag-CdO contacts after high current arcing were investigated. The contacts were always opened on the same half cycle (60 Hz ac); thus one electrode was always the cathode, the other always the anode. Qualitative spectra of the arc at its midpoint were also taken, The results indicate that during arcing, there is a much higher concentration of Cd vapor than of Ag vapor in the interelectrode region. It is also found that the erosion of the cathode is more severe, and that the metal in the interior of the cathode craters is depleted of CdO, while a layer of Ag-Cdo is built up in the anode craters."
"In deion arc chambers it is necessary for good extinction that the arc leaves the contacts in time and is split into series arcs. The time between contact opening and the start of arc migration is strongly dependent on the contact material. It affects the formation of plasma streams, which initiate arc migration. Further factors are magnetic blast and current, The number of series arcs around current zero depends, beside other parameters, on the material of the chamber walls. It can be significantly increased by gassing wall material in the contact region."
  "The basic mechanisms of wear and lubrication of gold-based contact materials, particularly eiectrodeposits, from the point of view of separable connectors and instrument slip rings, are reviewed. Specific recommendations are made for optimizing contact finishes for practical devices. Included are a discussion of the following. 1) The categories of metal transfer and wear (such as prow formation) and of transition phenomena that control the sliding mechanism. 2) Theories that have been advanced to explain sliding behavior based On bulk and on surface properties of the contact material. 3) The dependence of contact lubrication on physical properties of the lubricant and topography of the contact. 4) The potential role of underplate in improving a gold contact materials system, including reduction in wear and friction, minimization of susceptibility to corrosion in polluted atmospheres, and elimination of degradation due to thermal diffusion of elements from the substrate through the gold."
"A program is being conducted for testing of slip rings for synchronous orbit application. Instrumentation systems necessary for monitoring electrical noise, friction, and brush wear at atmospheric pressure and at less than 5 x 10-8 torr have been developed. A multiplex scheme necessary for the simultaneous recording of brush displacement, friction, and electrical noise has also been developed. Composite brushes consisting of silver-molybdenum disulfidegraphite and silver-niobium diselenide-graphite have been employed on rings of coin silver and rhodium plate. Brush property measurements made included measurement of density, electrical resistivity, shear strength, and microstructure. Four contact combinations have been tested during an ambient condition run-in at 150 rev/min and a humidity sequence at 0.1 rev/min. The first six months of the two-year vacuum test at 0.1 rev/min have been completed. Electrical noise, friction, and brush wear data recorded during these periods have been analyzed and indicate the following. 1) MoS2 lubricated brushes gave lower noise values than those lubricated with NbSe2. 2) Friction coefficients are lower in vacuum than in air with MoS2 giving the lowest coefficient. 3) Low wear rate is the result of combination performance rather than a particular ring or brush material. 4) The best overall performance was obtained from Ag-MoS2-C/Ag combination."
"The resistance to creep and stress relaxation of an aluminum-iron-magnesium alloy conductor (0.80 wt % Fe-0.11 wt % Mg) was found to be superior to that of EC-grade aluminum currently used for communication cables and compares favorably with that of commonly used ETP copper conductor. The aluminum-iron-magnesium alloy conductor, when suitably processed, has good tensile and yield strength as well as ductility. In addition, this material can be readily processed into telephone cables containing wire conductors smaller than 0.81 mm (20 AWG) while EC-grade aluminum cannot. Because of its improved resistance to creep and stress relaxation in the temperature range of interest, the aluminum-iron-magnesium alloy conductor adequately lends itself to pressure-type connections such as those used with telephone cable. The enhanced mechanical properties of this material further offer substantial advantages over EC-grade aluminum in field placement operations. This material, therefore, is believed to be an economically attractive, acceptable replacement for tough-pitch copper in telephone cables containing conductors 0.51 mm (24 AWG) and larger."
"The mechanisms of degradation which occur in mechanical connectors on aluminum power conductors have been examined. The factors investigated include constant and cycling mechanical load, stress relaxation, plastic deformation, surface finish, temperature, temperature cycling, and supertemperature. The aluminum-aluminum interface is shown to be stable, and the design requirements for stable connections to aluminum conductors are given."
"The methods commonly used to evaluate electrodeposits for electronic systems include characterization of the deposit itself, actual field exposures, and accelerated laboratory exposures. The importance of minimizing deposit porosity, using a diffusion barrier coating, and having a deposit with adequate resistance to wear tO insure long-term contact reliability is emphasized. The question of predicting useful field life from the results of accelerated laboratory exposures is considered. It cannot be done without sufficient comparisons between the results obtained in the real and simulated environments."
"Design criteria for free convection cooling c,f electronic systems are considered, The primary emphasis is on electronic equipment in which vertically oriented circuit cards are aligned to form vertical channels. Results of an experimental study utilizing a simulated electronic cabinet are discussed and compared with theoretical solutions obtained by numerical integration of the partial differential equations governing the heat transfer. Good agreement is shown between predicted and measured card temperatures for several different card spacings. Parametric effects on the maximum card temperature are given for card spacing, heat dissipation, and channel height. Nomograms are developed for rapid estimation of card temperatures and for choosing optimum card spacings. The effects of channel flow restrictions, staggered cards, and baffles are also discussed."
"The phenomena of high-frequency-discharge trimming of RuO2-basad glaze resistors was investigated as a function of the following: 1) the sintering condition of thick-film resistors, 2) the relation between the amount of additives to resistors and the rate of increase or decrease of resistance, 3) the effect of heat treatment before and after the trimming and effect of glass overcoating, 4) the influence of the trimming on neighboring resistors, and 5) the stability of resistors after the trimming. It has been found that the rate of change of resistance by this trimming is affected by fabrication conditions of the resistor, that its influence on nearby resistance is small, and that the stability of resistors after the trimming is satisfactory."
"Mechanism of resistance change by high-frequency-discharge trimming has been investigated for RuO2 glaze resistors. As a result, it is found that the resistance of RuO2 glaze resistors eventually increases when subjected to the discharging over an extended period because of structural damage of the resistor films. As for RuO2 · glass resistors, the resistance increases with the increasing discharge time, but as for Ag- or Nb-doped RuO2 · glass resistors, the resistance decreases during the initial stage of the discharging. The main cause for the resistance reduction is the increasing concentration of Ag atoms in the trimmed area in the case of Ag-dopad resistors, and in the case of Nb-doped resistors the change in valence value of Ru, i.e., Ru4+ -> Ru3+."
"The basic reactions, compositions, and electrical properties of glazed Pd-Ag sintered layers through a firing process have been examined by differential thermal analysis, thermograviometric analysis, and X-ray diffraction analysis. The evaporation and combustion of screening vehicle and solvents, the oxidation-reduction behaviors of Pd and Ag the creation of PdAg solid solution, and the electrical properties and stability of these resistors have been studied. From these tests it was found that the degree of process sensitivity for these resistors was high, and electrical properties and stability of these resistors were affected in much the same way by firing temperature and firing period. They were influenced most by temperature rise rate and least by temperature fall rate."
"Accelerated life tests under elevated temperarure, high humidity, and vacuum have been conducted on Pd-Ag thick-film resistors It is found that the change of resistance under those accelerated life test conditions is mainly caused by oxidation and reduction of the electrically conductive components (Pd and Ag) of Pd-Ag thick-film resistors. Through life tests in vacuum, the effect of adsorption was found to be less important than the structural change inside the resistor."
"Tantalum nitride and tantalum aluminum thin-film power resistors were reactively sputtered on 99+ percent alumina ceramic substrates in an argon atmosphere, thermally stabilized, and laser patterned into serpentine paths (two to ten meanders) to obtain final values two to two hundred times their initial values. The resistors were then subjected to many tests to determine their stability. Data from the load life test, after 5000 h at 13.3 W/in2 in a 66°C ambient, indicate that thermally stabilized tantalum nitride and tantalure aluminum resistors may be laser patterned without affecting the films' intrinsic stability, provided certain constraints in the resistors' geometry are recognized and observed by the designer."
"A method to identify conductive bridge contaminants has been developed using pyrolytic and chromatographic principles. A known contaminant is deposited on the surface of a metal film resistor and placed in a glass test fixture. A load is applied to the resistor with a powerstat until the material becomes active. A sample is taken of the gaseous products and analyzed with a gas chromatograph. Distinct and characteristic patterns emerge for the various common contaminants. A manufacturer could follow the same procedure 'to establish \"standard\" chromatograms for contaminants in his process. Periodic lot checks would enable him to locate and isolate the specific contaminant."
 "The variation of resistivity with temperature for thin polycrystalline films of bismuth on BeO substrates is reported. Resistivity minima at temperatures of 90-150°C were observed for films of thickness 0.08-1.0 microns. Experimental results are compared with the theory relating the decrease of the mean free path by grain boundary scattering to the decrease in sample size."
"Vacuum annealing has bean used to routinely manufacture tantalum nitride resistor networks with temperature coefficients in the range of ±50 ppm/°oC. The as-sputtered temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of tantalum nitride films with nitrogen content set for optimum stability is approximately --130 ppm. Although near zero TCR's can be obtained by reducing the nitrogen content during sputtering, such films exhibit substantial negative changes when dc loaded. Networks were fabricated on aluminum oxide substrates using in-line sputtered tantalum nitride films and vacuum evaporated chrome-gold conductive termination films. Anneal schedules (to remove structural defects) in the range of 460°C to 510°C for 4 h were found suitable for producing films with near zero TCR over a sheet resistance range of 30-75\\Omega/square. Conventional photolithography techniques were used to delineate resistor networks with up to 20 resistors per network. After a thermal stabilization of 16 h at 250°c, the resistors were anodized to ratio tolerances as close as 0.05%. Resistances of 50\\Omegato 20 k\\Omegawere manufactured on a single network. Load life and thermal aging results indicate no degradation in performance as a result of shifting the TCR by vacuum annealing. Temperature cycle changes were less than 0.01%. Resistor TCR tracking was less then 7 ppm/°C on 0.700 X 0.700 network. Resistor noise was measured and found not to differ from unannealed resistor films. By incorporating the vacuum annealing step into the standard tantalum nitride manufacturing process, resistor networks with near zero TCR can be produced with the same excellent stability possessed by unannealed films."
"Here is a discussion on the fabrication, characterization, and economic considerations of a set of complex hybrid integrated circuits being used in exploratory switching applications. Several approaches to fabrication are discussed. One approach is unique in that it includes four distinct technologies in addition to simple thin film interconnections. They are (1) beam crossovers, (2) thin film resistors, (3) thin film capacitors, and (4) metallized via holes to a backplane. Alternate approaches including discrete capacitor elements are also discussed."
"The transient temperature response and thermal profiles near the junction of a transistor or other semiconductor device are nearly impossible to measure experimentally. These response characteristics can be accurately predicted, however, through the use of computeraided simulation. In this paper results from the simulation of two microwave power transistors are presented and discussed. In particular, the first device contains a single large junction area, and the second contains multiple junction areas. Thermal characteristics within the chip itself, that is, from the transistor junction to the chip .carrier, are emphasized. This region usually contains, by far, the greatest fraction of the total\\DeltaT between the junction and the final heat sink, especially under pulsed power operation. Transient temperature response curves, internal temperature distributions and the effects of temperature dependent material properties are described. The effects of varying the power dissipation rate, pulse length and duty cycle are shown, and final1y, methods of improving heat transfer, such as the use of a diamond heat-spreader, are discussed."
"The influence of powder geometry on the performance of tantalum electrolytic capacitors was investigated over a range of conditions. Two design normalizations were chosen to compare measurements with a transmission line model. To a first order approximation the results are as predicted by theory. Ano'malies appear in the behavior of capacitance and the equivalent series resistance (ESR) under extreme conditions. Powder geometry and anode size also give second order effects. The findings are useful in capacitor design."
"Ceramic units were fabricated having internal porous layers which extend to two edge faces of the units. The porous layers were analogous to the internal noble metal electrode layers of conventional ceramic multilayer capacitors. By impregnating the porous regions with conductive materials such as Ag, Pb, or Sn, capacitors were formed. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the structures of the porous regions and of the impregnated metals. An end termination technique was developed for use with injected internal electrodes of low melting point metals Units were made having electrical characteristics similar to conventionally prepared units with noble metal internal electrodes."
 "A completely new planar method permitting step-free multilevel interconnections is proposed. The key role in this technique is played by the polyimide film which is used as insulating layers. The fluid property of the polymer solution always gives an ideal flatness to the surface of the wafer no matter how many steps are formed by preceding metallization processes. Using this planar metallization with polymer (PNIP) technique, a five-level structure which consists of five metal (aluminum) and five polyimide layers has been successfully made, The PMP structure completely eliminates the failures which result from open circuits between metal layers at crossovers and via-holes and from short circuits between metal layers through the pin-holes of insulating layers. No trace of degradation is observed in the characteristics of the MOS-FET covered with the polyimide either after heating at 150°c for 2000 hours or after a bias-temperature test at 125°c for 200 hours."
  "A capacitor has been developed which is superior to previously reported duplex capacitors. The dielectric consists of anodic tantalum oxide overlaid with silicon dioxide deposited by RF sputtering. This capacitor proved usefuI as a low-valued capacitor Of capacitance density ranging from 150 pF/mm2to 20 pF/mm2, corresponding to a thickness range of a silicon dioxide film from 0.2 µ/m to 2.0µm. The capacitor can be produced with very high yield Of approximately 100%, due to the defect-free anodic oxide film diminishing the importance of defects inevitably induced in the RF sputtered silicon dioxide film. The silicon dioxide film can be deposited without causing any deterioration of the anodic film of tantalum oxide by Control of the RFsputtering conditions. The capacitor remained stable with no failures occurring when aged under various conditions of voltage, temperature, and humidity. The capacitor can be processed in a manner compatible with the manufacturing process of the TM or TMM capacitor."
 "The properties of standard card edge, printed circuit, and flat cable connectors have been investigated from the point of view of transmitting pulses with very short rise times. A simple theory based on linear approximation of the leading and trailing edges of the actual pulse waveform is derived to predict the effect of impedance mismatch caused by the connector. Experimental confirmation of the theory, measurements of popular types of connectors, and extrapolation of experience with a 350-Mb/s logic network confirm that, under certain conditions, the currently available connectors can be used with pulse rise times longer than 250 ps and with interconnection impedances from 50 to 100 ohms. Transmission lines matched at both ends and/or balanced pairs are preferred for interconnections between different parts of a very fast (greater than 250-Mb/s) pulse system."
"Copper alloys have long served as spring materials in electromechanical devices, but the miniaturization of electronic equipment has imposed new demands on these materials. The first is that of improved elastic properties to ensure satisfactory performance at the higher operating stresses and temperatures encountered in these miniaturized devices. The second is that of improved methods for characterizing those spring properties of design interest in light of the more stringent operating margins encountered in these devices. Some of the newer alloys, processing methods, and strengthening mechanisms being employed to provide copper alloys with improved elastic properties are reviewed. Thermomechanical processing is shown to be a particularly effective means for achieving high strengths in a variety of copper alloys. New methods for characterizing the elastic properties of spring materials are discussed and compared to traditional methods based on tension tests."
"Data on the compressive stress relaxation of chill-cast 60/40 tin-lead solders for two loads, 6.89 and 24.8 MN/m2 (mega newtons/ square meter) and for temperatures from 27 to 108°C are presented. For the complete temperature range tested, it is shown that the stress relaxation can be modeled as an Arrhenius reaction-rate process with an activation energy of 0.65 eV This activation energy is in close agreement with solder activation energies inferred from earlier studies of self-diffusion, creep, and creep rupture. This suggests that the stress relaxation is diffusion dominated for the temperature range studied, and that the present results may be extended to other tin-lead solders by using available correlations."
"Ceramic materials of interest for electronic components, such as ferroelectrics, ferrites, and transition metal oxides have no natural glass-forming habit. A rapid cooling of their melt is required to obtain homogeneous glasses. This is the most important requirement for controlling crystallization and phase dispersion, as required for Various applications. Materials and methods used for making disk and multilayer capacitors are discussed and their properties are described for normal and high voltage applications, and for hybrid circuits. Other application areas to be discussed are cryogenics, thermistors, varistors, and magnetics."
 "Although it is generally accepted that the use of adhesives in the fabrication of hybrid microcircuits offers advantages over other bonding methods, there currently does not exist a set of guidelines for the selection of adhesives which will ensure sufficient compatibility with microcircuit components and metallization systems to meet the long use-life, high-reliability requirements of military and space applications. The initial results of a study directed to the task of selecting suitable evaluation tests which can form the basis for such guidelines for electrically insulative adhesives are presented. The properties of adhesives considered to be of major importance for the proposed application are enumerated and briefly commented on. Polymeric types of adhesives are briefly reviewed and the major epoxy resin-curing agent systems comprising the adhesives that are commercially available and represented as being specifically designed for microelectronic use are identified. Specific tests to determine the chemical and electrolytic corrosivity of adhesives to commonly used metallization systems, their long term outgassing after cure, and their bond strengths under a variety of conditions are defined and discussed in detail. Comparative results obtained to date from these tests are given for five representative adhesives. All are epoxies cured with a different major type of curing agent: a primary secondary amine, a tertiary amine, an anhydride, a modified heterocyclic amine, and a boron trifluoride complex."
"During the past decade, semiconductor junction electroluminescence has evolved from a laboratory phenomenon to a manufacturing technology. This success can be attributed to the extensive research in the preparation and characterization of III-V compounds. Materials emitting radiation in various regions of the visible spectrum are now available. The epitaxial growth techniques used in the fabrication of III-V compound electroluminescent devices are reviewed. Both vapor and liquid phase epitaxial techniques are discussed, including the applications of these techniques to well established materials as well as newer materials. The state of the art of light-emitting devices fabricated from members of the III-V compounds and their solid solutions is also reviewed."
"The stability and hence reliability of sputtered gold-tungsten and gold-molybdenum films has been determined as a function of anneal temperature up to 650°c. Isothermal and isochronal resistivity experiments have yielded an activation energy for particle growth in 3000 Å gold films of 0.4 eV below 200oc and 0.7 eV about 200oc. The activation energy for the refractory layer was calculated to be 1.8 eV from particle size measurements. Annealing the films up to 500oc for 24 h resulted in a decrease of internal stress in gold from 2.5 x 109 dyn/cm2 to 0.2 x 109 dyn/cm2. Similar decreases in internal stress were observed for tungsten and molybdenum. The observed results are discussed in terms of microstructural changes."
"An R F sputtering system was employed with a target consisting of a 20cm diameter aluminum disk, about 1/4 of which was covered by a segment of tantalum. This target construction makes it possible to obtain on a single substrate a broad range of film compositions in one sputtering run. The result, concluded from X-ray analysis, is that only three phases are observed on a 10 cm by 10 cm Coming glass substrate. 1 ) On the aluminum side there is the fcc AI lattice with about 7 at% Ta dissolved in it-93 at% AI 7 at% Ta. 2) On the tantalum side there is a\\beta-Ta lattice with about 20 at% AI dissolved in it--80 at% Ta 20 at% AI. 3)Between these two phases exists an amorphous phase--85 at% AI 15 at% Ta. The thickness profile over the substrate shows a deep well between the 80 at% Ta and the 15 at% Ta-phase. This profile indicates that there is a condensation gap for the composition from 15 to 80 at% tantalum. Resistivity and measurements of temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) yield values from 30 to 240\\mu\\Omega-cm and from +500 to --125 ppm/deg K, respectively, depending on the position on the substrate, that is, depending on the phase present, The two aluminum-rich phases have, as far as we know, not previously been reported, neither in bulk nor in thin film form. We have observed most attractive features of these phases in their annealing and anodizing behavior."
"The effect of various annealing ambients on the ionic charges contained in the dielectric structures of silicon dioxide-silicon and silicon nitride-silicon dioxide-silicon was investigated. It has been observed that most effective ambients in making ionic species immobile are nitrogen and a mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen chloride gases. Further, silicon nitride used as passivating dielectric films over semiconductor devices has been observed to be an effective barrier for ionic impurities."
"Suecessful multilayer processing requires careful selection of conductor and dielectric pastes. As pastes they must satisfy geometrical and processing needs; as conductors and dielectrics they must meet electrical and other requirements. Some dominating considerations for paste selection are reviewed. A method is described for evaluating paste performance with test patterns which simulate multileyer applications. Various popular conductor and dielectric pasteswere evaluated and the results are reported. Some frequently encountered processing problems and their causes are discussed. Although all pastes evaluated were found less than ideal, a satisfactory combination of conductor and dielectric pastes was selected."

"The Analysis of the Reflector Antenna is a monograph which documents the recent advances in the theory of reflectors developed during the space program and particularly of the work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It is written for the engineer who needs to understand the design and performance limitations of reflector antennas. While it is not a text book, it may also prove useful in engineering introduction courses on diffraction. The book is divided into three sections: 1) the mathematical theory of diffraction, 2) the definition and calculation of antenna parameters, and 3) the use of digital computers in the analysis and design of reflector antennas and feed systems."
"This book deals with the geometrical optics as developed from Fermat's principle of least time. It is concerned with the tracking of ray and wave fronts through homogeneous and inhomogeneous media and throughout optical systems. Among the many books that treat the subject of geometrical optics, most fail to prove, in the authors view, the concrete link with the underlying mathematical foundation on which geometrical optical technology has been erected. For this reason, the authors dwell in some detail on the mathematical background required for geometrical optics and on the optical interpretation and application of mathematical theorems."

In my opinion, a list of PhD dissertations and authors is of relatively lower value to a majority of G-AP members in comparison to an orderly sequence of clear tutorial' and/or expository papers, which would provide the background necessary to derive full value from the papers now being published."
"This is the seventh in a series of books published by the Golem Press in Electromagnetics. This book deals mainly with the following problem: If the statistical characteristics of the field over the aperture or length of an antenna are assumed to be known, what are the statistical characteristics of its radiant pattern, gain, beamwidth, etc. such as mean value, fluctuations, and correlations. The treatment goes much beyond the usual antenna tolerance theory, which normally deals with only with small errors in the excitation and small correlation distance."
"This monograph is devoted to the investigation of surface wave propagation along guides with inhomogeneous sections; where the guide parameters vary gradually in the direction of propagation. Practical cases of continuous transitions are, for instance, the launching of surface waves on a single wireline and surface wave antennas. The material presented in this monograph is in essence is done by the work of the author and his associates which was published in Russia during the years 1960 to 1965. "
"This rather specialized monograph on conical radiators is an interesting change of scope for the author from his previous book on slow wave structures. Until recent years, conical antenna theory and in fact conical antennas were mostly of interest to graduate students. In the interests of science, the vigorous efforts on conical scatterers with reduced RCS reawakened interest in cones. And in the interests of science OS, the work of Ross and VanEtten showed that conical antennas can be extremely good for very broadband and very short pulse applications. "

 "Concepts of ray optics and the results of Sommerfeld's half-plane diffraction theory are applied to obtain theoretical expressions for the elevation plane radiation field produced by double parasitic loop counterpoise antennas. Theoretical results are compared with results obtained from model measurements. Within the range of approximation the agreement between theory and experiment has been found to be satisfactory. A method of designing the antenna for special application to air traffic control systems is also discussed briefly."
 "The fields at the open end of a parallel-plate waveguide with aTE_{10}mode incident are calculated. For plate spacings greater than about 0.6 wavelengths, these are well approximated by incident and first-order diffracted fields. Consequently single diffraction at the aperture alone is often adequate for pattern calculations and, although no more complicated, is superior to the Kirchhoff result, even for on-axis calculations. Numerical values for Kirchhoff, geometrical theory of diffraction and exact on-axis gain demonstrate this. In contrast, for TEM incidence, both methods yield the exact on-axis gain. Application of these results to the improvement of gain prediction of horns is discussed."
"In this paper, the possibility of analyzing scattering and antenna problems from a singularity expansion point of view is discussed. As an example of the method, a thin-wire scatterer is considered by first determining the locations of the exterior natural resonant frequencies and then constructing the time response of the current on the body, much in the same manner as in classical circuit theory. The numerical techniques used will be presented, and some advantages of the singularity expansion method over the other conventional ways of treating this problem will be mentioned."
"The effects of certain atmospheric conditions upon pulse-code modulation (PCM) data transmission at a carrier frequency of 15.3 GHz are discussed in this paper. Using an amplitude-shift keying (ASK) modulation to transmit 1300000 bit/s across a 9.5 mi line-of-sight path, the performance characteristics of the system, relating to conditions in the channel, were measured and are presented in this study. Theoretical curves of probability of error versus predetection signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), are compared to measured error probabilities; these are obtained at different received signal levels, and under various clear weather conditions ranging from humid to dry. Above 15 dB predetection SNR, the system operates more efficiently than theoretically predicted for ASK modulation over a Rayleigh fading channel. The detected envelope probability distributions are computed for different values of SNR. Results show that drier weather, which causes amplitude fluctuations of a shallow nature, results in greater error probabilities than those for more humid conditions; the term shallow fading is used to describe short term (5-10 min) received signal envelope variations of less than 1 dB. For example, error probabilities for a predetection SNR of 14 dB, ranged from 0.005 to 0.078, from humid to dry conditions respectively. These values fall between the theoretical values of 0.0005 for the nonfading case, and 0.0740 for Rayleigh fading."
"Hochstim and Martens were the first to use Monte Carlo computations to study scattering characteristics of scalar waves from randomly fluctuating slabs with an exponential spatial correlation. This paper describes an alternative procedure which overcomes some of the difficiencies in their treatment and extends the study to physical circumstances which their treatment excludes (e.g., background inhomogeneity, crossover into cutoff regions, etc.). The two-point correlation function characterizing the medium fluctuations (more directly the spectral density) may be arbitrarily selected and is no longer restricted to an exponential. The correlation properties of the medium are virtually independent of the length of the elementary slabs comprising the overall slab region, whence the medium may be structured by equal sized slab realizations-a major advantage whenever a background profile is superimposed. Furthermore, the statistics associated with the reflection and transmission of both the coherent as well as the incoherent waves are calculated separately. The results so obtained yield solutions with which appropriate analytical theories can be conveniently compared and they provide information additional to that found in previous studies. As examples, the syntheses of Gaussian and exponential correlation functions are shown. For the exponential, propagation calculations for a homogeneous random slab were made using the new technique and compared with results using Hochstim and Martens' approach."
"The problem of a cylindrical dipole antenna symmetrically mounted on a conducting coaxial cylinder is analyzed both theoretically and experimentally. The theoretical approach is based on the Fourier transform solution for thin wire antennas, equivalence and image principles, point matching, and numerical optimization. The basic idea is that the modified dipole structure can be replaced by an equivalent system (as far as exterior fields are concerned) consisting of a simple perfectly conducting rod excited by an array of magnetic ring sources. The coefficients of these sources are then adjusted to match boundary conditions on the cylindrical modification surface. For the locations of the match points and sources, three gauges involving weighted integrals of the tangential electric fields are used to optimize the solution. Good agreements between measurement and theory have been obtained for the input admittances, resonance properties, and radiation patterns. Results are also presented for a dipole on a sphere to contrast effects due to change in modification shape."
"Antenna imaging by a perfectly conducting finite flat disc is investigated analytically and numerically as a function of the radius of the disc. A conical monopole of variable length is considered above the screen and the normalized terminal admittance of the antenna is plotted versus the disc radius. The radiation pattern is also plotted and the current distribution above and below the screen is evaluated. The results provide a quantitative measure of the effectiveness of finite screens in imaging antennas and bring to light the persistent distortion of the pattern caused by the finite size of the screen in contrast to the behavior of the impedance."
"In the past, smoothly varying turbulence has been studied by changing the structure constant to the functionC_{n}^{2}(\\bar{r}). The purpose of this paper is to show that this approach is insufficient, and that a random process developed by Silverman can be used to describe the wave fluctuations in localized smoothly varying turbulence. The localized turbulence is characterized by a correlation function which is a product of a function of the average coordinate and a function of the difference coordinate. The corresponding spectrum is also given by a product of a function of the difference wavenumber and a function of the average wavenumber. They are related to each other through two Fourier transform pairs. Making use of the preceding representations, the fluctuations of a wave propagating through such a turbulence can be given either by the integrals with respect to the two wavenumbers or by a convolution integral of the structure constantC_{n}^{2}(\\bar{r}) and a function involving the outer scale of the turbulenceL_{0}. It is shown that for a plane wave case, if the distanceLis within (L_{0}^{2}/\\lambda), then the usual formula given by Tatarski is valid. But if the distance is betweenL_{0}^{2}/\\lambdaand(bL_{0})/\\lambdawherebis the total transverse size of the turbulence, the variance of the wave is nearly constant, and ifL \\gg (bL_{0})/\\lambda, the variance decays asL^{-2}. Similar conclusions are shown for a spherical wave case. Some examples are shown illustrating the effectiveness of this method."
"A general solution for the current distribution on a cylinder in a cold magnetoplasma has been obtained. It is complicated, but for practical applications several simplifications occur. We present an outline of this solution and a sample of results."
 "There are at least three different definitions of cross polarization used in the literature. The alternative definitions are discussed with respect to several applications, and the definition which corresponds to one standard measurement practice is proposed as the best choice."
"An alternate form [1] for the near zoneE_{z}fields of an annular ring of magnetic current is derived. The new expression avoids numerical differentiation, offers significant improvements in efficiency, and is particularly useful in the analysis of coaxially driven parallel arrays."
"The concepts of the geometrical theory of diffraction are used to derive the on-axis gain of two-dimensionalEplane sectoral horns. Geometrical optics and single (noninteraction) diffraction by the aperture edges yield essentially the Kirchhoff result-a monotonic gain versus wavelength curve. Reflection of diffracted fields from the horn interior and double diffraction at the aperture add an oscillation to this curve which is not significantly altered by further diffraction for moderate to large horns. Including these results approximately in Schelkunoff's equation for the pyramidal horn explains the gain variations observed in microwave gain standards and provides an error estimate in their predicted gain."
"Equivalent edge currents, derived from the edge diffraction theory for a half-plane, are used to obtain the radiation patterns of a parabeloidal reflector antenna when illuminated by a source at the focus. Cylindrical wave diffraction coefficients are used. The method avoids infinities at caustics and shadow boundaries thus giving solutions which are finite everywhere. A slope-wave equivalent current correction term is applied when the illumination is tapered towards the edge of the reflector. Comparisons are given with the physical optics approach and experimental results."
"The asymptotic form of the diffracted field produced by a plane electromagnetic wave of arbitrary polarization incident obliquely on a conducting half-plane is expressed very simply in terms of the incident and reflected wavesF_{1}andF_{2}, respectively, rotated to bring their wave vectorsk_{1}andk_{2}onkin the direction of observation. The diffraction coefficients become\\pm(\\sin \\psi_{i}/2)^{-1}where\\psi_{i}is the angle betweenk_{i} (i = 1,2)and the direction of observationk."
"Investigations of electromagnetic scattering from rough surfaces have been oriented toward radar surveillance or remote sensing applications. An important problem that has been relatively unexplored is that of a dipole antenna close to and illuminating an ocean surface with spherical waves; for example, communication antennas on submarines or surface ships. This work is concerned primarily with the fluctuations in the space wave field intensity caused by reinforcement and cancellation of the direct wave by the wave reflected from a moving sinusoidal ocean surface. Certain situations arise so that the sinusoidal model is a good approximation of an actual ocean surface. For this case, the amplitude of the sine curve is small compared with a free-space wavelength; therefore, a Fourier integral-perturbation series approach can be used to solve the boundary value problem. Two primary conclusions are drawn from this model of the ocean surface. First, the widest field variation occurs in the direction broadside to the direction of wave motion. Second, a depolarized field term is introduced, and it is directly proportional to the maximum slope of the surface. Finally some practical aspects of RF communications are discussed. For example, it is noted that the RF fading rate is related to sea state."
"A simplified ray-optics (scalar) theory is presented which can be used to calculate interference patterns in the shadow of a diffracting obstacle whose transverse profile consists of two or more straight line segments. The theory is applicable when the pathlength-to-wavelength ratio is large and the diffraction angle is small, conditions typical of terrestrial microwave diffraction links over conical mountain peaks. Scale-model test results show that the theory quite accurately predicts the pattern structure."
"An experimental study of the input impedance of a short cylindrical antenna immersed in a laboratory magnetoplasma is reported. The antenna is fixed in length and is aligned with its axis parallel to the dc magnetic field. Of particular interest is its impedance behavior in the vicinity of the resonance and cut-off conditions of the magnetoionic medium. Independent measurements are made to determine the electron density from the ion-current characteristics of a spherical Langmuir probe and the strength of the applied magnetic field with a Hall-effect probe. Measured impedances are compared with Balmain's theory. Essential features observed experimentally are a peak in the antenna input resistance near the upper hybrid resonance frequency and a peak in the antenna conductance near the cyclotron frequency. An additional small increase in the input resistance is observed near the plasma frequency when the plasma frequency is not close to either the upper hybrid resonance frequency or the cyclotron frequency. These results suggest the possibility of using a short cylindrical antenna as a diagnostic probe for measuring properties of a magnetoplasma such as the electron density and collision frequency."
"Matrix equations are given for solving the problem of scattering by a plasma cylinder surrounded by another plasma layer with an axial static magnetic field. The cylinders are assumed to be normally illuminated by anHwave. The numerical calculations were performed for nonconcentric circular plasma cylinders and the scattering properties of interest are also shown."
"Approximate surface fields due to a plane-wave solution and a local-mode solution are compared. The plane-wave solution, which is new, is shown to agree well with experiment. The local-mode solution, which often has been applied to tapered waveguides and antennas, fails near the cutoffs of the surface waves."
"The method previously proposed to investigate the diffraction of electromagnetic waves by gratings, in the case of an infinite conductivity is developed. This method, based on the properties of the analytic functions, allows the solution of theoretical problems and reduces the determination of the efficiencies to the study of differential systems. Some examples show its utility for numerical computation. Good agreement is observed in comparing with the results obtained from other techniques (integral equations)."
"An investigation is presented dealing with the ground reaction and the mutual interaction of horizontally and vertically oriented loops in antenna arrays of arbitrary configuration located above the ground and contains the calculation of appropriate reaction coefficients. Because of the similarity of the derivations for systems of vertical and horizontal loops, only the calculation technique for systems of vertical loops is performed in detail."
"The near-field polarization ellipse is described. The tip of the near electric-field vector traces out an ellipse lying in an arbitrary plane. The peak and rms values of the magnitude of the electric vector are determined, as well as the orientation of the ellipse. The results are related to near-field radiation hazard criteria."
"Using the covariance of Maxwell's equations and the phase invariance principle of plane waves, distortion of the electromagnetic pulses undergoing total internal reflection from a moving dielectric half-space has been studied. It is concluded that the distortion of the reflected pulse depends strongly upon the velocity, direction of motion, and angle of incidence."
"An analytically simple and sufficiently accurate solution for the eigenvalues of a class of spherical wave functions is presented. The class of spherical wave functions considered are modes in conical and quasipyramidal waveguides with perfectly conducting walls and hybrid modes in corrugated conical and quasipyramidal horns with an impedance boundary. The indicated solution has been first used to obtain in closed form eigenvalues of the class of spherical wave functions considered which are subsequently used as the starting values for evaluating the exact eigenvalues with a simple digital-computer based iterative algorithm. The digital-computer evaluation of the eigenvalues has been found to be very fast, since the starting values are close to the exact solution, irrespective of the flare angle of the radial waveguides considered. Further, some mathematical insight has been provided in order to explain why the asymptotic solution, which appears to be valid only for small flare angles, yields eigenvalues close to the exact one even for wide flare angle(s) of the radial waveguides."

 "A circularly polarized feed for anS-band high gain antenna system is designed to have a minimum axial ratio when radiating into free space. However, when the feed is located at the focal point of a 2-ft diameter parabolic reflector, the axial ratio \"blows up.\" An experimental technique, which overcomes this difficulty without any change in the basic feed structure, is described. In addition, other RF test results are presented."
"The radiation characteristics of a paraboloid with an axially defocused idealized point-source feed are derived using numerical integration of the physical-optics currents. Results from the standard \"linearized\" analysis are compared with results obtained without approximating various factors in the integrand. In particular, the more complete analysis reveals that the defocusing curves are not symmetrical about the focus. At values of defocusing which cause deep nulls in the defocusing curves of less-tapered feeds, the angular beam exhibits bifurcation. Consequently, these less-tapered feeds are not generally suited to beam broadening applications."

"Using as a model a parallel-plate flanged waveguide excited by a uniform magnetic line source, the techniques of mode match, geometrical theory of diffraction, and Kirchhoff radiation are compared. In all cases the aperture fields are analyzed in terms of waveguide modes; the far-field results are Fourier transforms of the aperture fields. To within normalization, the Kirchhoff results compare surprisingly well with the two other methods except near resonance and in the low observation angle regions where the diffracted components of the field are dominant."
"The correspondence of the scattered field by two elliptical reflectors to the diffracted field by two circular apertures is investigated. The experimental verification of this aperture field method is performed. Also, as has been clarified, the idea of shadow in a geometrical-optics sense is still useful in microwave region."
"In this communication the equations for the radiation of a line source above a lossy medium (earth) are presented. Numerous data on the variation of the field as a function of distance and direction from the source, operating frequency, and conductivity are included. Changes as a function of source position are also investigated. The results can be used in the design of mine rescue communication systems."
"By using a computer program, the authors intend to compute quantities specifying the low frequency scattering behavior of rotationally symmetric bodies which are metallic (electromagnetic scattering), soft, or hard (acoustic scattering)"
"The reflection and transmission properties of electromagnetic waves obliquely incident on a relativistically moving uniaxial plasma slab are investigated theoretically and the maxima and minima of the power reflection coefficient as a function of the normalized incident wave frequency (\\Omega) and the slab velocity (\\beta) are discussed for slab motion parallel as well as normal to the slab boundaries. One can predict the nature of variation of the reflection coefficient with respect to any parameter from the variation ofq'(the root of the dispersion equation) with that parameter. Whenq'is real and varies rapidly, the oscillations in the reflection coefficient are rapid and whenq'differs significantly from the free-space value, the amplitude will be large. In the imaginary range ofq', the reflection coefficient is nonoscillatory. The discussion of the results is facilitated by introducing a parameterpwhich is a quadratic in\\beta. For slab motion parallel to the interface, the two slab velocities for a givenpgive rise to same reflection coefficient whilst for normal motion the results are significantly different."
"AnN-port loaded scatter is one havingNports to which lumped impedance loads or a load network is connected. Methods are given to determine the characteristic modes of a loaded scatterer and for using them in a modal solution for electromagnetic scattering. A procedure is also given for resonating any given real port current, which makes that current the dominant mode of the loaded scatterer. The theory is formulated both in terms of open-circuit and short-circuit network parameters. A number of numerical examples are given for a wire triangle to illustrate the general theory. Computer programs are available for all procedures discussed."

"The Wiener-Hopf technique is employed to derive the near-field solution for scattering by a semi-infinite conducting tube due to an axially incident plane wave. Numerical results are included and emphasis is given to the interpretation of the results in terms of the error in the measurement of the magnetic field due to the presence of the sensor boom. It is found that at interior resonance frequencies the measurement error can be as large as 100 percent in the immediate neighborhood of the end of the boom. Guidelines for reducing such errors are suggested."
"Recent studies of radar target signatures at a missile range, revealed errors in some of the formulas on the echo area of the prolate spheroid of the above paper (see abstr. b23863 of 1969). These errors originated from a report referenced in the paper. The report contains tables of values needed to calculate Moffatt's impulse response. Two of these tables, Tables II and III, contain incorrect values. While computed echo areas and transient responses of the spheroid do not seem overly sensitive to the effects of these errors, they should be eliminated to avoid compounding errors in the model with errors in the calculations. The correct versions of Tables II and III and those equations found to be in error in the report, as well as those equations found to be in error in the paper are presented here. The original numbering is retained here for the sake of identification"
"Coaxial feeds produce an approximate sector-shaped pattern, an almost optimum pattern of a feed for high aperture efficiency and low spillover of paraboloid antennas. Such a coaxial feed consists of a central circular waveguide which is surrounded by one or more conductors with circular cross sections. Theoretical and experimental investigations on coaxial feeds excited by H11modes have shown that the first ring yields the highest increase in the aperture efficiency of paraboloid antennas illuminated by them. Measurements performed on paraboloid antennas illuminated by a coaxial feed with only one ring yielded aperture efficiencies of 68 to 75 percent for angular apertures of the paraboloidal reflector of100\\degto160\\deg. Circularly symmetric patterns in conjunction with almost linearly polarized aperture fields can be achieved by multimode coaxial feeds. The values for the aperture efficiency, which are calculated for paraboloid antennas illuminated by multimode coaxial feeds, nearly reach the theoretical optimum. The measured values are 68 to 80 percent. In addition, the multimode feeds produce very little cross polarization."
"The scan-plane fields in the focal region of a beam-scanning paraboloid are determined from physical optics. Amplitude and phase contours are presented, and comparisons are made with the geometrical-optics results. Contours for maximum scan-gain are determined as a function ofF/Dand illumination taper and compared with the Petzval surface. Unless theF/Dis very large or spillover is excessive, a higher scan gain is achieved when the axis of a directional feed is parallel to the axis of the reflector than when the feed is directed toward the vertex. The contour of maximum scan-gain is a function of both illumination taper andF/D. In general, largerF/Dvalues tend to have a maximum-gain contour close to the focal plane, while the smallerF/Dvalues tend to have a maximum-gain contour closer to the Petzval surface. Increasing the illumination taper moves the maximum-gain contour closer to the Petzval surface. Normalized maximum-gain contours are presented as a function of beamwidths of scan. The frequency dependence of these results is discussed."
"Varying the spacing between the transposed transmission line feeder and the radiating elements of the loop-coupled antenna is investigated experimentally using far-field swept-frequency techniques. An optimum spacing is found in the sense that anomalous frequency performance is minimized. A theory using dispersion relationships is developed and used to explain some of the experimental phenomena observed."
"The electrical characteristics of a hardenable metallic lens or radome having a near-unity index of refraction are described. The near-unity index of refraction constrains lens designs by either restricting the maximum lens diameter or greatly increasing the focal length. An alternative is to use a metallic grating as a radome, which would retain the hardness properties of the metallic lens. This radome design was experimentally measured at 10 GHz using a parallel-plate grating with spacings between 1 and 4 in. Measured pattern and gain characteristics are reported."
"The results from various approximate methods of solution to three basic equations for the impedance of the asymmetrically driven perfectly conducting thin cylindrical antenna are briefly discussed and compared. Generally good agreement is found between method-of-moment solutions and the three-term King-Wu theory. Largest disagreement with those approximate methods is found with the Shen-Wu-King solution and the joining procedure."
"Attaching blinders to the sides of pyramidal horn reflector antennas and other large aperture antennas is one method of controlling high sidelobes for horizontal polarization. This paper describes analysis and design procedures for arriving at a useful multiple-edge blinder for reducing undesirable sidelobes of a pyramidal horn reflector antenna. Several blinders have been designed and tested for use with a pyramidal horn reflector antenna. They are directed at reducing a high sidelobe near90\\degin the azimuth plane where levels (referred to the main lobe) of -52 dB at 3.74 GHz and -58 dB at 6.325 GHz are presently typical. A 14-edge blinder designed using these techniques reduced these levels by 20 dB at 3.74 GHz and 12 dB at 6.325 GHz and did not significantly degrade antenna performance for other angles and other polarizations."
"A method for computing the effect of the wave reflected inward from the edge of circular ground screens is developed. Numerical results show that the reflected wave is unimportant to the performance of very large screens and only of small importance for moderate size screens. However, as the screen size is further decreased, the relative importance of the reflected wave increases."
"A two-dimensional density is constructed from given marginals and a given correlation coefficient by using an expansion in orthogonal polynomials. The results are used to derive a general method of finding the field scattered by a rough surface by both physical and geometrical optics when the surface is generated by a stationary random process which is not necessarily normal. The example of an exponential surface is calculated in more detail, particularly for backscatter."
"The Kirchhoff method and the small perturbation method are usually used in combination in the composite model of rough-surface wave scattering. They are shown to be identical to the first order for scattering by a perfectly conducting body of a circularly polarized incident wave into a scattered wave polarized in the expected sense of circular polarization. Thus for this case, a single application of the Kirchhoff method is as accurate as the composite model and is simpler to apply. The identity remains valid for arbitrary directions of incidence and scattering, but not for other polarizations. Statements in the literature at variance with these results appear to be based on derivations which neglect some part of the complete solution."
"The edge condition for a perfectly conducting wedge which has its exterior region divided by a resistive sheet is derived. It is shown that the behavior of an electromagnetic field at the edge is altered as a result of the appearance of the resistive sheet but is independent of the resistance value. In particular, the singularities in the electric field components transverse to the edge in the absence of the resistive sheet have been eliminated. This assures the finiteness of the energy dissipated on the resistive sheet in the vicinity of the edge."
"Expressions for the reflection and the transmission power coefficients are derived for the case where a plane wave is obliquely incident on a dielectric slab in which the relative permittivity decreases symmetrically according to a1/z^{2}law from a given maximum value at the plane of symmetry and tends towards unity at the two faces of the slab. The effect of the curvature and other parameters governing the inverse square profile on the transparency property of the material at radar frequencies has been studied within a larged/\\lambdarange wheredis the half-slab thickness and\\lambdathe wavelength of the incident wave."
"Historically, most near-field analyses have relied upon aperture-integration techniques. The purpose of this paper is to point out the advantage of the plane-wave spectrum (PWS) approach for analysis of antenna near fields. The advantage of the PWS approach over aperture-integration techniques is quite substantial throughout the entire near-field region for circular apertures. Furthermore, the advantage increases in proportion to closeness to the aperture. The PWS approach also appears to offer advantage for noncircular apertures, e.g., rectangular, at least for large aperture sizes."
"The theoretical and experimental radiation patterns of an extended vertical line antenna placed over an infinite conducting strip are presented. The results show the nature of dependence of the level of back radiation upon the strip width and antenna height."
"An analysis is presented of the radiation pattern produced by the open-ended radial waveguide with TM mode excitation. Radiation patterns have been computed for TEM,TM_{10}, andTM_{20}mode excitation and comparison is made with measured results."
"The field on the dielectric wedge is approximated by a plane-wave expansion as in [1]. Contributions from this solution to both the surface field and the radiation field are examined. Finally, an experimental radiation field is compared with the plane-wave solution and with a geometric-optical diffraction field."
"It has been found that the size parameter\\alphaof a perfectly conducting sphere and the angular positions of the extrema of the Mie scattering intensities are related by a simple equation involving one constant characteristic of each extremum. These constants for the first sixteen extrema counted from the forward direction are presented here for0 < \\alpha \\leq 90. A simple relation gives the constants for higher order extrema."
"The construction and the applications of the Brillouin diagram for a magnetized ferrite are discussed. It is pointed out that the application of the principle of limiting absorption for the determination of the proper solution in an unbounded ferrite is readily carried out with the help of the Brillouin diagram."
"A procedure for obtaining the group velocity diagrams for a magnetized ferrite medium is given. Some results of group velocity diagrams are presented for the purpose of illustrating their general features."
"Simple expressions are presented for the fields diffracted by a metallic half-plane when illuminated by an impulsive plane cylindrical or spherical (scalar or vector) wave."
"The atmospheric absorption spectrum in the 220 GHz window region is controlled primarily by the water vapor lines centered at 183.3 and 323.8 GHz. There are however, numerous other lines in the submillimeter part of the spectrum which contribute significantly to the losses. At the longer millimeter wavelengths, it has been the practice to lump the contributions of the submillimeter lines using the Van Vleck low frequency approximations. This procedure is not permissible for the 220 GHz window region because of the promixity of some of the submillimeter lines. Experimental measurements substantiate this observation. The present study introduces an alternative approximation for calculating the residual effect of submillimeter lines. The results, larger by a factor of 2, are in closer agreement with experimental observations."
"Two experiments are reported which were designed to demonstrate the theoretical relationship between the phase-front distortion of line-of-sight microwave signals and the refractive index structure along the propagation path. Measurements were made on a slanted 64-km path in Hawaii with an elevation angle of2.5\\deg, using a horizontal array of 4 antennas at the upper terminal to observe the phase structure function, and an airborne refractometer to measure the refractive index structure. The predicted phase structure function computed from the refractometer data is compared with the observed structure function, and shows best agreement in the periods 0100-0700 hour and 1300-1900 hour."
"The synthesis of optimum signals for transionospheric propagation along a vertical path is considered in this paper. It is seen that optimum band-limited signals having complicated amplitude and frequency modulation results in good pulse compression over a wide range of ionospheric conditions. The transmission of linearly swept carrier (chirp) pulses having rectangular and Gaussian envelopes is then considered with the result that appreciable compression is also seen to occur for these signals. Finally, an example is given of the statistical effects that variations in the total ionospheric electron content have on enhanced pulse transmission."
"A theoretical investigation by an integral equation approach for the determination of the atmospheric refractive index profile from satellite radio tracking data is reported. A numerical solution is constructed by applying a minimum mean-squared estimator. An iterative procedure is suggested and shown to be convergent."
"Tropospheric phase noise in the 9.6-GHz range and range-difference data was studied experimentally on a 65-km slanted overwater path, with baseline lengths of 10, 370, 400, and 749 m at the lower terminal. The noise data are interpreted in terms of their power spectra and rms values as a function of baseline length. Results of a cross-correlation analysis of the range variation data are consistent with a \"frozen turbulence\" model of the troposphere."
"Lewis' inverse scattering method is applied to a perfectly conducting sphere. The results of a simulated experiment are compared to those given by this method."
"The approximate log normal distribution of normalized power antenna patterns within the\\pm1rad near-in region is presented for several families of illumination functions as an aid to system designers concerned with interacting radar type systems. The means agree well with experimental data on similar patterns, but the standard deviations are considerably greater. An empirical expression relating the first sidelobe level and antenna size to the 0.5 probability level has been extracted to aid system applications of the results. For360\\degcoverage, a synthetic pattern is presented which gives a distribution close to the measured data."
"The application of dynamic programming to the synthesis of broad-band antenna arrays with arbitrary frequency-independent elements is investigated. Four criteria are proposed for the optimization of the array. By employing these criteria it is shown that the optimum array is the one with monotonic spacings. For such arrays the principle of optimality is proved and the limits, within which dynamic programming is applied, are analytically calculated. A 35-element array with ratio of upper-to-lower frequencies equal to 3 is synthesized by this method."
"A least-squares polynomial-fit representation is obtained for experimentally measured charge distributions on a base-driven monopole antenna immersed in free space and also in a homogeneous dissipative medium. This representation for the charge is then used in evaluating the tangential electric field near the antenna."
"An alternative treatment of junction discontinuities in wire antennas and scatterers to that used by Chao and Strait [1], Chao et al. [2], and Taylor et al. [3], is presented. Comparisons with published experimental results and with computations by Chao and Strait [1] have been made to verify the accuracy of the method. The method involves replacing the junction with an equivalent charge distribution found from the integration of the continuity equation in the vicinity of the junction to obtain the constraint on the currents at the junction. The approach is particularly applicable to method of moments [4] calculation employing pulse expansion functions, although it may be applied with any subsectional method of moments solutions. The method is accurate and convenient for programming purposes."
"The theoretical analysis for the field pattern of two identical coaxial circular loops is presented and the field patterns with two loops of different spacings are plotted. The realization of a fan-shaped beam for scanning purposes is discussed."
"One of the problems of the spiral-antenna direction finder (DF) is the alteration of phase reference with logarithm of the frequency [1]. Compensation would require a special network operating over the bandwidth of the DF antenna. This communication describes a technique using two antenna apertures which are identical except for the sense of winding of the antenna arms. The frequency dependent error is canceled with signal averaging after phase detection of each antenna. The same measurement technique could be used to measure elevation angle by phase comparison."
"Several small order Butler matrices may be interconnected to replace a single large Butler matrix normally employed in beam forming and scanning networks for linear and circular arrays. This permits reduction in the size of the feed system resulting in a saving of system components and hardware. The penalty is an increase in the beamwidth for circular arrays and a reduction in the number of beams for linear arrays. The submatrix feed system has the additional advantage that it can be used to excite arrays withNelements (N \\neq 2^{n}), which normally cannot be fed by a single Butler matrix."
"Radar cross section measurements were made for spherically blunted8\\degright-circular cones with nose radii of 0.037, 0.092, 0.183, and 0.366 wavelengths over a range of base diameters from 0.25 to 1.75 wavelengths."
"The theoretical foundations for synthesizing linear aperture distributions by means of pattern sampling are generalized to admit arbitrary location of the sampling points and arbitrary choice of the edge exponent\\alpha. The generalization is based upon Paley and Wiener's theory of nonharmonic Fourier series. Explicit formulas are derived for the special case of semi-periodic sampling."
"The effect of a dielectric sheet cover on theE-plane realized element gain pattern of a circular array of axial thin slits is considered. In similar planar arrays, such patterns are characterized by nulls which appear even for spacings less than\\lambda/2. This phenomenon has previously been linked with the influence of a leaky wave on the near field. It is shown in this paper that, in circular arrays, similar dips occur accompanied by pattern distortions."
"This paper discusses the properties of radiating slots excited by multimode waveguides. Impedances for slots in rectangular waveguide propagating the TE10and TE20modes were measured and compared with theory. Patterns were taken of a two-slot array and compared with theoretical predictions. Apparatus to perform these measurements was developed and tested."
"The lower limit on the effective area of an antenna and its directivity dependence on area are explained on the basis of the limited localizability of a photon and Heisenberg's principle of uncertainty."
"Presents the back cover of the periodical issue."
"The effect of dielectric loading upon theE-plane radiation patterns of rectangular horns is shown to give higher directivity with raised sidelobes. The main beam and first sidelobe can be predicted accurately in terms of radiation from aTM_{y10}mode."
"The design procedure of the log-periodic dipole (LPD) antennas is discussed. The results of the calculations carried out by the use of the more recent and accurate methods of the analysis for the arrays of unequal dipoles, are compared with those already available in the literature. The calculations refer to the gain of LPD antenna as a function ofZ_{0}, the characteristic impedance of the exciting transmission line, ofh/a, the ratio between the half-length and the radius of dipoles, of\\tauand\\sigma, two parameters which describe the geometry of the LPD antenna. The values of gain are lower than those given by earlier calculations. The degradation of the gain is more consistent, when the values either ofZ_{0}orh/aare increased with respect toZ_{0} = 100 \\Omegaandh/a = 125, which are parameters often used in the literature. The many diagrams included in this paper for different values of\\tau, \\sigma, Z_{0}, andh/acan be useful in a more accurate design of an LPD antenna. Confirmation of the computer data has been obtained by the tests performed on various scale models and on a full scale antenna."
"The so-called equivalent parabola technique has been used extensively in the design of Cassegrainian systems. Hannan substantiated the validity of the technique by showing the excellent agreement between his measured data on a Cassegrainian system and the calculated results obtained using the equivalent parabola technique. However, his demonstration was restricted to an on-axis feed Cassegrainian. This paper derives an analytical expression involving only a 2-dimensional vector integral for the secondary vector field from the Cassegrain system with an offset feed by integrating over the surface currents on both the main dish and subdish with the\\phiintegrations performed in closed form, and proceeds to compare its results with those obtained from the equivalent parabola technique, for differentf/Dof the main dish, eccentricities of the subdish, illumination patterns, and lateral displacements of the primary radiator. The agreement in general is good for Cassegrainians with an on-axis feed. For Cassegrainians with an offset feed, the error in using the equivalent parabola technique remains negligible for a beam scan of as much as four beamwidths."
"Wire antennas are solved using a moments solution where the method of subsectional basis is applied with both the expansion and testing functions being sinusoidal distributions. This allows not only a simplification of near-field terms but also the far-field expression of the radiated field from each segment, regardless of the lengthL. Using sinusoidal basis functions, the terms of the impedance matrix obtained become equivalent to the mutual impedances between the subsectional dipoles. These impedances are the familiar impedances found using the induced EMF method. In the induced EMF method an equivalent radius is usually used in the evaluation of the self-impedance term to reduce computation time. However, it is shown that only for very thin segments that the correct equivalent radius is independent of length. When the radius to length ratio (a/L) is not small, an expansion for the equivalent radius in terms ofa/Lis given for the self-impedance term. The use of incorrect self-term, obtained by using a constant equivalent radius term, is shown to be responsible for divergence of numerical solutions as the number of sections is increased. This occurrence is related to the ratio ofa/Lof the subsections and hence becomes a problem for moderately thick wire antennas even for a reasonably small number of segments per wavelength. Examples are given showing the convergence with the correct self-terms and the divergence when only a length independent equivalent radius is used. The converged solutions are also compared to King's second- and third-order solutions for moderately thick dipoles."
"The cross polarized radiation for linearly polarized excitation and the beam displacement for circularly polarized excitation have been investigated for offset reflector antennas. Numerical calculations are given to illustrate the dependence upon the angle\\theta_{0}between the feed axis and the reflector axis as well as upon the half-angle\\theta_{c}subtended at the focus by the reflector. In the case\\theta_{0} = \\theta_{c} = 45\\deg, measured results have been obtained for both linearly and circularly polarized excitations with a dual mode feed illuminating an offset paraboloid. The cross polarized radiation of horn reflector and open Cassegrainian antennas rises sharply to rather high values off the beam axis; however, in general, the maximum cross polarized radiation of offset reflector antennas can be made small by using a small angle between the feed and reflector axes. The cross polarization caused by offset is compared with that caused by an unbalanced feed pattern. The effect of the longitudinal current distribution and of departure of the surface from a paraboloid on cross polarization are also examined. The clarification of these cross polarization properties is found to be valuable in the design of reflector antennas."
 "The experimental results of the radiation characteristics of waveguide excited dielectric spheres backed by metallic hemispheres are reported. The test antenna consists of a dielectric loaded hemispherical horn excited by a circular waveguide. The test data have shown that such a structure produces a radiation pattern with low sidelobe levels, increased on-axis gain, and reduced 3 dB beamwidth as compared to a waveguide excited dielectric sphere of same diameter and an optimum horn having an aperture of identical cross section area. Also, it presents a low VSWR over the waveguide band."
  "The spatial impulse response functions of simple ionospheric models are computed using a ray-tracing technique. Such functions show measurable dependence on the single parameters characterizing the assumed profile. Hence the solution of the inverse problem (i.e., to determine the profile of the ionosphere from a measured impulse response function) seems feasible."
"A numerical method for solving a time-dependent thin-wire electric-field integral equation is briefly described. Results obtained for a straight wire antenna and scatterer excited by a time-varying Gaussian pulse and valid to a maximum wire length of approximately 10 wavelengths are presented."
"A stepped-septum polarizer has been designed that is capable of at least 26 dB of isolation over a 20 percent frequency band. The three-port device may be used to excite high purity left or right circular, as well as tilted linear polarizations in a phased array of square waveguides."
 "The first-order approximate angular probability density function of wave arrival can be obtained by plotting the mean-square value of signal level versus the pointing angle of a mobile radio directional antenna during an entire test run. The accuracy of this first-order approximation is dependent on the beamwidth of the antenna. As the beamwidth of the antenna becomes narrower, the approximate density function becomes more accurate. There are also higher order approximations for obtaining a more accurate angular probability density function without narrowing the directional antenna beamwidth. These higher order approximations are related to the moments of the signal strength received by the same directional antenna used in obtaining the first-order approximation. All of these are theoretical predictions. An experimental verification using a first-order approximate angular probability density function in finding theoretical level crossing rates of a mobile radio signal is given. The theoretical level crossing rates are in fairly good agreement with the experimental ones as long as the angular probability density function is not far from a uniform distribution."
"Center loaded linear parasitic arrays of dipoles are examined. It is shown that capacitive loading increases the phase velocity of the slow wave on the structure while inductive loading reduces it. For the infinite array, used as a transmission line, this has the effect of modifying the cutoff frequency and the bandwidth. This is experimentally verified for the capacitive loading. For a simple finite array without a reflector, due to end effects only a small bandwidth widening is observed. However, when the finite array is attached with a suitable reflector, a significant widening of bandwidth is observed. In both these cases the loading causes a significant shifting of the center operating frequency. This effect is utilized to build a tunable Yagi array with varactor loading. With variable bias this loading can effectively be adjusted to double the operational bandwidth. Also it is shown that it is possible to sustain the optimum array directivity over a very wide bandwidth without bias adjustments, by a special loading network."
"This paper describes a systematic technique for obtaining high aperture efficiency in a Cassegrainian feed system by special shaping of the subreflector. Theoretical expressions are derived that determine the subreflector shape, which gives a uniform illumination of a paraboloid for a given primary feed pattern. Experimental data are then presented, which demonstrate the enhanced performance of a Cassegrainian feed system using a subreflector shaped according to the theoretical expressions."
"A systematic method to solve electromagnetic wave propagation problems associated with slotted cylindrical structures is to represent the field by a set of radial modes, the discontinuity by a multimode junction network, and to solve the transverse resonance equations. Derivations of the radial mode representation of the field and the network representation of a slot are provided. The application of this method to a slotted circular waveguide is also given, and its solutions show good agreement with previous findings."
"A general formula is derived for the scattering cross section of a passiven-element linear array consisting of isotropic radiators. When all the reactances are tuned out and scattering in the mirror direction is investigated, it is found thatA_{sr}, the relative scattering cross section is equal to the square of the maximum gain the array can produce. As a consequence, for forward scattering in the limiting case of zero spacing between the elements,A_{sr} = n^{4}."
"Thinned arrays (mean interelement spacing greater than one-half wavelength) are made aperiodic to suppress grating lobes. Many thinning algorithms were created in the 1960's and tested by computer simulation. Seventy such algorithmically designed aperiodic arrays are examined and the distribution of their peak sidelobes, relative to the expected values for random arrays having the same parameters, is obtained. The distribution is compared to that of a set of 170 random arrays. Both distributions are found to be nearly log normal with the same average and median values. They differ markedly in their standard deviations, however, the standard deviation of the random array distribution (1.1 dB) is approximately half that of the algorithmic group. The compactness of the random distribution almost guarantees against selection of a random array with catastrophically large peak sidelobes. Among the several algorithms examined, the method of dynamic programming produced the lowest peak sidelobe on the average."
"The purpose of the present investigation is to determine the difference between the scattering effects from two types of supports on satellite antenna pattern measurements. The difference in scattering effects is estimated by comparing low-gain antenna patterns recorded when using a foam tower and a model tower."
"The performance of radiating elements in the form of monopoles and driven by transistors is examined theoretically and experimentally. A single element comprising a printed monopole over a ground plane and fed at its terminals by a microwave transistor is shown to have superior frequency characteristics compared to the passive element. Using a two-element array configuration, it is verified that the mutual impedance values are suppressed. The improved individual characteristics of the active elements together with their mutual behavior combine to produce a significantly improved frequency performance of the array. The results presented suggest that the transistorized array principle offers a means both of maintaining directivity of a transmitter, and discriminating against interfering sources by a receiver, over a greater frequency band."
"The diffraction coefficient for a conducting wedge loaded with a cylindrical dielectric slab at the apex is derived from a boundary solution for anE-polarized plane incident wave on a slab of small electrical radius. The relative contribution of the dielectric is shown to be a small perturbation term which is free of singularities at the shadow boundaries."
"A modification of the classical Rayleigh technique utilizing the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is developed for electromagnetic scattering and is referred to as the Rayleigh-FFT approach. Numerical scattering results from a sinusoidal surface are compared with calculations obtained by a Rayleigh perturbation approach, physical optics, and a rigorous integral equation method. These comparisons together with self-consistent error criteria are used to define the circumstances under which the Rayleigh-FFT approach is valid. For perfectly conducting sinusoidal surfaces, the method is valid at normal incidence when the maximum surface slope is less than about 0.6 (\\lsim 31\\deg) but no limit on surface height is apparent. Slope restrictions are explained by the inherent Rayleigh error since maximum errors occur in surface troughs as expected. The Rayleigh-FFT approach is increasingly reliable, for a given geometry, when the rough half-space tends toward dielectric from perfectly conducting. Perturbation solutions to Rayleigh's technique are shown to be extremely limited. Physical optics is valid when the minimum radius of curvature of the surface is greater than a wavelength. The Rayleigh-FFT method has been extended to obtain valid scattering results from arbitrary irregular periodic structures composed of a rough layer over a rough half-space."
"The radiation resistanceRof a short electric dipole in a drifting magnetoplasma has been calculated. For very small length,Ris found to behave asV_{0}^{-3}whereV_{0}is the drift velocity along the magnetostatic field."
"When an electromagnetic pulse having a Gaussian envelope is passed through the ionosphere it remains a Gaussian pulse; however, its amplitude is reduced and its pulsewidth is increased with respect to what these parameters would be for free space propagation. It is pointed out that if this Gaussian pulse is chirped (i.e., if it is given a linear FM), then after passing through the ionosphere and following the pulse compression in the receiver, the signals envelope is still Gaussian. Furthermore, when the bandwidths for both signals are the same (or equivalently, when the pulsewidth of the compressed transmitted chirped pulse is the same as that of the transmitted unchirped Gaussian pulse) the amplitude degradation and pulsewidth spreading are identical for both signals. This not too surprising result applies as long as the time-bandwidth product is large enough for the chirped signal. The results obtained for chirped Gaussian pulse are compared, as to the pulse distortion introduced by the ionosphere and available bandwidth of the ionosphere, with the results obtained in the literature for other waveforms. It is pointed out that the amplitude degradation and pulsewidth spreading for a chirped signal having a 40 dB Taylor or Hamming weighting is about the same as obtained with the chirped pulse having a Gaussian envelope as long as the compressed pulsewidths of the transmitted signals are identical. Finally, the numerical results obtained previously in the literature are presented in a more convenient form."
"The consequences of nonuniqueness for integral equations used in the numerical resolution of electromagnetic scattering problems are investigated from a practical point of view. The scatterers are closed perfectly conducting cylinders of arbitrary cross section illuminated by a plane wave in bothEandHpolarizations. It is shown how to detect the frequencies at which nonuniqueness occurs, and how to avoid the resulting errors by the use of the notion of an equivalent problem. This approach is compared to other ones proposed by different authors. A new interpretation of the computed solution, when uniqueness conditions are not satisfied, is given and it is shown how to use such a solution in the computation of the resonant modes of the interior problem, even for degenerate modes."
"A Fourier decomposition technique is used to reconstruct the near-field from far-field pattern data. Upper and lower bounds are derived on the number of Fourier componentsNrequired for accurate field convergence. It is shown thatNdepends on both the distance from the origin of the near-field reconstruction point and the error level\\epsilon^{-2}which arises from errors in the data and numerical quadratures. The theoretical results are shown to be in agreement with observations on near-field reconstruction for centered cylinders. It is then found that field reconstructions for less regular objects made in accordance with the convergence bounds enable certain estimates to be made of the character of the scattering object. With this, analytic continuation techniques may be applied and a second reconstruction performed nearer to the object's expected location. The nonregular scatterers treated in this paper are off-axis cylinders."
"A study of the radiation characteristics of corrugatedE-plane sectoral horns is described. Assuming the corrugations to be infinitely thin and sufficiently close packed, impedance boundary conditions are imposed on the fields in the axial region of the horn and it is established that a separable modal solution of fields in terms of TE tozmodes is possible for this geometry. The horn aperture field is determined in terms of cylindrical wave functions and the vector diffraction formula is used to analyze the far-field radiation patterns. Excellent agreement is obtained between the theoretically derived pattern with experimental results for horns supporting the balancedHE_{11}mode with small flare angles (2_{\\alpha 0} \\leq 30\\deg), designed using the theory presented. Bandwidth properties of the horn have been studied which may be used to advantage in designing a corrugatedE-plane sectoral horn without much degradation of its radiation characteristics corresponding to the balancedHE_{11}made over a wide frequency bandwidth (1.5:1)."
"The meander-line polarizer consists of several printed-circuit sheets with etched-copper meander lines. The sheets are spaced about one-quarter wavelength apart. This communication explains the principle of operation of the polarizer, describes the design procedure, and gives dimensions and performance data of a typical polarizer. For example, an axial ratio of better than 1.5 dB has been obtained overXband. The polarizer can be used for medium high-power densities. A theoretical analysis of dissipation loss and experimental results of high-power tests are presented."
"The analysis of an antenna array may be reduced to the solution of a set of linear equations. For large arrays, the solution of the set of equations requires considerable computer time. This communication shows how the matrix properties arising in the special case of a linear equally spaced array can be exploited to devise an efficient method for solving the set of equations."
"A theoretical study of the radiation and reflection of a electromagnetic surface wave at a guiding structure discontinuity is given in this paper. A TE surface wave is considered. It is supported by a dielectric coated conductor which has a contour deformation of the guiding surface. When the deformation is small, the problem may be treated by the boundary perturbation technique to yield the radiated electromagnetic wave and the reflected surface wave. A numerical example is given to illustrate how the radiation pattern and the reflection coefficient vary for different degrees of surface deformation."
"A procedure is described for designing a set of feed voltages for a given dipole array from the solutions to theE-plane synthesis of line source antennas. The method of moments is used in order to relate the feed voltages to the sampled values of a line source distribution. The feed voltages are determined in such a manner that the resultingE-plane pattern matches approximately that of an equivalent line source. As illustrations, Taylor's line source synthesis technique is extended to theE-plane synthesis of dipole arrays."
"An analysis of mutual coupling effects in linear and planar uniformly spaced semi-infinite arrays is presented. The currents under arbitrary excitations at the array ports are obtained by solving an infinite order difference equation with the aid of an extension of the Wiener-Hopf factorization procedure to finite Fourier transforms. The solution for mutual coupling coefficients as well as for the active reflection coefficients in a phased semi-infinite array is expressed explicitly in terms of the active impedance in a phased infinite array. The analytical results are directly applicable to the evaluation of \"edge effects\" in large phased arrays. Numerical results for active reflection coefficients and element patterns are presented for a semi-infinite array of slots in a perfectly conducting ground plane and for a linear dipole array."
"Characteristics of spiral top-loaded antenna (STLA) have been derived by the self-consistent field method, and a general design procedure has been systematized. The results of the analysis suggest that the STLA has desirable characteristics among very low frequency antennas because of its relatively small size, low feed voltage, and absence of tuning inductor."
"A method for wide-band wide-angle impedance matching of rectangular waveguide phased arrays is presented. A maximum VSWR of 2.3:1 is achieved over a 50 percent bandwidth with a60\\deghalf-angle conical coverage using an element spacing six percent less than the condition required for grating lobe suppression. A further reduction in element spacing, bandwidth, or scan volume results in an even better impedance match. Simplicity and high radiation efficiency are the unique features of this matching technique."
"Analysis of the boresight sum gain and difference slope of a four- or five-horn fed Cassegrainian reflector is shown to be greatly simplified when the horns have circularly symmetric patterns. For a five-horn array of diagonal horns, closed-form approximate results are shown to be in very good agreement with experimental data."

"It is well known that optimal arrays based on the minimum mean-square error criteria also maximizes the output signal-to-noise ratio for very narrow-band signals. In this correspondence we will present an analysis which compares this performance of an optimal array to the signal-to-noise performance of a conventional array."
 "The use of points on the surface of the poincaré sphere to represent the polarization state of fully polarized electromagnetic fields is extended to partially polarized fields by representing their polarization by points inside the sphere. The coordinates of a point\\bar{W}representing the polarization state are shown to be simply related to the Stokes parameters. The center of the sphere represents a completely unpolarized wave, and the degree of polarization is given by the distance of the point\\bar{W}from the center of the sphere. A simple formula is derived for calculating the power received by an antenna illuminated by a partially polarized wave. A method is described for measuring the polarization state by a number of intensity measurements."

"A new technique is described for determining power gain and polarization of antennas at reduced range distances. It is based on a generalized three-antenna approach which, for the first time, permits absolute gain and polarization measurements to be performed without quantitative a priori knowledge of the antennas. The required data are obtained by an extrapolation technique which includes provisions for rigorously evaluating and correcting for errors due to proximity and multipath interference effects. The theoretical basis provides a convenient and powerful approach for describing and solving antenna measurement problems, and the experimental method employed illustrates the utility of this approach. Examples of measurements are included which exhibit errors in gain as small as\\pm0.11dB (3\\sigma)."
"A new method is developed for determining the farfield pattern of an antenna from probe compensated near-field measurements over the surface of a right circular cylinder enclosing the antenna. The method is derived by first expanding both the field radiated by the antenna and the field radiated by the measurement probe, when it is used as a transmitter, into cylindrical wave expansions. The Lorentz reciprocity theorem is then used to solve for the field radiated by the antenna from the probe output voltage. It is shown rigorously that the antenna pattern can be determined independently of the characteristics of the measurement probe provided that certain calibration data are known. A method for determining these data from the measured far field radiated by the probe is described. It is shown that the necessary numerical integration can be performed with the fast Fourier transform algorithm. Experimental results are presented to validate the theory and to demonstrate its practicality from a measurement and computational viewpoint."
"Strong cosmic radio sources provide a constant broadband and accurately positioned test transmitter for measurements of large antennas. Some sources have their flux density determined absolutely and can be used to calibrate the antenna gain. This paper presents up-to-date data on the radio sources which are useful for antenna measurements. The measurement of pointing and focusing corrections is discussed. The main part of the paper is concerned with the derivation of major antenna parameters such as aperture and beam efficiency, beam solid angle, sidelobe levels, error pattern characteristics from measurements on radio sources. The effects of a finite angular source size are discussed, and it is shown how measurements on sources of different size increase the information on the derived antenna parameters. The methods to measure very weak sidelobes are treated and the external factors, solar and galactic radiations influence of the earth and atmosphere, which might limit the accuracy of the measurement are described. The paper takes a practical approach to the subject and contains graphs with numerical data."
"A quadratic receiving antenna system is defined as a multiport antenna whose outputs are passed through square-law detectors, or, in pair, through correlators (product detectors). These detected signals are then linearly combined with different weights to give the output or response of the receiving system. A reciprocity relation is derived which relates the electromagnetic field radiated by a multiport transmitting antenna excited by quasi-monochromatic noise sources to the response of a quadratic receiving antenna system. The noise sources exciting the transmitting antenna may be independent or they may be correlated. In general, the radiated field is partially polarized. The weights used in combining the signals from the square-law detectors and the correlators in the associated receiving system are determined by the intensities of, and the correlations between, the noise sources exciting the transmitting antennas. Practical use has been made of the derived reciprocity relation. The radiation properties of noise-excited multiport antennas have been determined by measurements made on the associated quadratic receiving system."
"A technique for measuring the complex polarization ratio of an arbitrary antenna is presented. The technique requires the use of two antennas which are not circularly polarized but are otherwise arbitrary. Only reciprocity and linearity are assumed. Six amplitude and phase measurements are performed, two measurements for each pair of antennas. The complex polarization ratio of each antenna is then calculated from the six measurements. The specific details of the measurement technique are described and some measurement results presented."
"A comparison between the antenna-pattern comparison technique and the free-space voltage standing-wave ratio technique for evaluating the reflectivity level of radio anechoic chambers is presented. Based on an analysis of the two techniques, it is pointed out which parameters influence the measured value of the reflectivity level. The comparison is illustrated with experimental results and it is explained why inconsistent and uncorrelated results may be found when the two methods are used. Furthermore, it is demonstrated, by introducing improvements in a chamber, how the reflectivity level can be used to measure the improvements. This work is inspired by the current discussion of finding a figure of merit for anechoic chambers. Based on the results, an evaluation procedure for anechoic chambers is indicated. However, it is pointed out and illustrated by examples that further investigations are necessary before a satisfactory procedure can be outlined."
"Experiments are described for determining the distributions of current, the driving-point impedance, and the electromagnetic fields characteristic of dipole antennas immersed in the sea near the surface. Measured and theoretical results are compared at two frequencies with good agreement."
"The measured input impedance of a practical dipole antenna is shown to be related to the theoretical input impedance of a delta-gap cylindrical dipole through a bilinear transformation. In order to determine the three complex constants which specify the transformation, the impedance of a dipole in front of a ground plane is measured and compared with the theoretical impedance. The comparison is performed by a curve-fitting procedure for bilinear transformation on a complex plane. The same measurement yields also the receiving efficiency of the antenna and its feeding network. Experiments show that the input impedance of a practical folded dipole, incorporating a balun transformer, may be predicted with an accuracy of better than four percent."
"The multiprobe reflector can perform the measurements usually performed with the slotted line without the need for mechanical adjustment, thus making it ideal for automated systems. Theory is presented showing how impedance data may be obtained from three or more arbitrarily placed probes; the spacing need not be at any particular fraction of a wavelength thus permitting very wide band operation. The use of additional probes permits measurement of frequency and also self checking of the system, thus providing accuracies comparable with the best slotted lines available. The simplicity of the hardware makes it easy to install in both standard and non-standard waveguides and transmission lines thus avoiding the use of adaptors with their attendant errors. A brief error analysis is included. Measurements of antenna impedance and wall loss, using a nonstandard size of waveguide, are presented and show an accuracy comparable with the best slotted lines."
"To calibrate electric-field sensors at extremely low frequency (ELF) the measured terminal voltageVat a receiving antenna is compared with the Analytically predictedVfor a precisely known incident field. That incident field is generated by an electrically very short thin linear radiator. Formulas are given for the field in the immediate vicinity of such a radiator above a perfectly conducting ground. Also given is an expression for the integral of this field along a vertical path starting at ground level. The expressions involve the magnitude of the current at the base of the radiator and methods are described for establishing that quantity precisely by measuring the base-to-ground voltage and the very small capacitance (about 20 pF) of the radiator. The methods for small capacitance measurement are also applied to linear and spherical receiving antennas, and experiments are described in which it was possible to predict the terminal voltage at a receiving antenna to within\\pm3percent when the voltage applied to the transmitting radiator, located at a relatively short distance (\\approx 16to 21 m) was known. Details of measurement circuitry are given including descriptions of an extremely high input impedance (\\approx 5000 M\\Omega) amplifier and a circuit for the compensation of cable capacitance. For a uniform incident field the effective height of both, a vertical linear receiving antenna and of a spherical antenna, is equal to the distance between ground level and the center of the conducting part of the antenna. Typical values for the natural, ambient ELF field in the frequency range 3 to 30 Hz are shown to be in the vicinity of 0.1 mV/m/Hz1/2."
"Measurements describing the patterns of a linear phased array antenna which has been electronically focused to a point in the Fresnel region, located a few aperture widths distance from the array face are given. The measurements were taken inside a building with no effort made to reduce extraneous reflections. A comparison of the results with patterns taken on a conventional far-field range reveals that the estimated measurement accuracy of the level of the first few sidelobes is on the order of\\pm1dB. The technique provides a good performance monitor check, is easily implemented, permits an indoor measurement, and offers the advantage of simplicity over far-field measurements."
"A system has been developed to measure the directivity patterns of full-scale antennas when located in their operational environments. The primary component of this system is an aircraft-towed multifrequency transmitter that is designed to approximate an elementary dipole antenna. An HF and a VHF version of this transmitter provide frequency coverage from 2 to 100 MHz. Techniques have been developed to measure the entire radiation pattern, from the horizon to the zenith, for several antennas simultaneously. Data derived from this system are processed to provide the radiation patterns as contour plots of the measured signal strength on azimuthal equal-area projections. The measurement hardware, data acquisition, and data processing techniques are described, and examples are given of measured and processed data derived from the system."
"A laser-mirror system incorporated into an antenna pattern range is capable of aligning the antenna tower to measure the radome boresight error of large antennas to within 0.1 mrad angular accuracy. The simplicity of the alignment system makes it relatively easy to position the antenna, with or without its radome to a preestablished mechanical reference plane. Hence, deflection of the antenna tower system due to different loadings can be determined which otherwise would be undetected with most range facilities."
"The corrugated horn discussed here is a valuable tool for use in microwave pattern ranges. It has the properties of concentrated energy in the main beam, low backlobes, high efficiency and almost monotonic amplitude, and phase radiation patterns which make the corrugated horn useful for a source antenna in a pattern range and also as a possible standard antenna for calibration purposes. A sample of the references that have dealt with the corrugated horn is given for the benefit of the reader [1]-[7]."
"Both complex and real multipole resonance frequencies in radar cross section (RCS) of a dielectric sphere are studied in some detail. Charts of real resonance frequencies and peak values are presented, which are then used to determine the complex permittivity of the material from the resonance measurement. The results show the possibility of highly accurate measurement at microwave frequencies. This method is unique in several respects and has many advantages."
"The characteristics of the astigmatic phase error in large parabolic reflector antennas are described. A procedure for focusing an antenna and diagnosing the presence and degree of astigmatism is given."
"The major contributors to the random component of the instrument limited angular measurement errors in electronically scanned phased array radars are reviewed and formulas are developed for statistical modeling of these error sources. The error model employed is applicable to space-fed and certain types of corporate-fed arrays. A comprehensive computer program, embodying this analysis, has been developed for determining these array measurement errors and their spatial correlation statistics, in two angle variables. This program is used to evaluate the statistical behavior of angular errors for some typical situations of interest. The use of angle, frequency, and phase \"dithering\" for improving the correlation statistics of these arrays is examined. The phase dithering technique is shown to be at least as effective as angle and frequency dithering and has the virtue of being readily implemented in the beam steering computer."
"Methods used to simulate dissipative media environments for antennas are reported and special techniques developed to determine the electrical properties of antennas in such media are discussed. Tank systems for simulating infinite homogeneous isotropic media characterized by ratios of\\alpha/\\betain the range0 < \\alpha/\\beta < 1.0are described along with the apparatus for determining the constitutive parameters\\sigmaand\\epsilonof the media. A new device for measuring antenna input admittance is presented which permits a simple measurement of admittance over a broad frequency range where conventional methods are cumbersome in field use. Apparatus for measuring antenna current and charge distributions is described together with a discussion of the associated probing errors. Measured admittances and current and charge distributions are compared with current theories for thin wire linear and loop antennas in the dissipative media and are found to be in good agreement."

"The absolute gain of wide-beam antennas may be accurately measured using the method described. Both the theoretical and practiced aspects of gain calibration on a ground reflection antenna range are presented. The measurement procedures developed were used to calibrate a log-periodic antenna at selected frequencies from 250 to 400 MHz. Measured data at 300 MHz is tabulated and error contributions are analyzed, yielding a measurement accuracy of\\pm0.27dB with a 95 percent confidence interval."
"Results of ground and flight tests carried out at 109 MHz to study the vertical plane radiation patterns of standard VOR and double parasitic loop counterpoise antennas above ground are discussed. The ground tests consist of the measurement of the fields produced in the quasi-radiation zone of the test antenna The flight tests consist of measuring the far field with the help of an aircraft flying at a constant altitude along chosen radial paths to and from the test antenna. The reduced test results are compared with available theoretical values."
"The observed sidelobe level of a linear array antenna is predicted approximately by assuming a computationally simple, uniform distribution of phase error, and the effect of this phase error is shown to mask the effect of an occasional isolated element failure. The assumed level of phase error was deduced from phase measurements in the feed network."
"This paper reports the measured reflection characteristics of a 90-ft anechoic chamber operated by The Aerospace Corporation. The design of this chamber, described as quasi-tapered, is unique in that it tapers from a large rectangular test region to a smaller square transmitting end. This design incorporates the performance advantages of a fully tapered chamber at low frequencies with some of the flexibility of a rectangular chamber when used at higher frequencies. The performance of this chamber is reported from 100 MHz to 93 GHz."
"Presents the back cover of the periodical issue."
"A concept is presented for recording antenna radiation patterns as functions of two parameters simultaneously. An implementation of the technique results in a significant savings in the measurement time required to document antenna performance as a function of the particular pair of parameters of interest. Application of the concept to beam scanning and frequency scanning antennas is discussed."
"A technique for using a pulse-type ionospheric sounder to measure the relative response of HF antennas toward the zenith is described, and some ionospheric limitations on the technique are discussed. Example measurements are given for selected field-expedient antennas (e.g., dipoles, slant wires, and whips) in forested and cleared areas, and the short-path skywave gain over an isotropic radiator is estimated. A\\lambda/2horizontal dipole elevated to about\\lambda/8above ground had the greatest gain toward the zenith of the simple antennas tested."
"An antenna impedance measurement technique based on the Weissfloch transformer theorem is described. In this method the antenna impedance is compared to a normalizing load whose value can be determined to a high degree of precision. The method provides a perfect transformer action between the antenna terminals and a point in the input transmission line, with the known transformer ratio. Baluns and other auxiliary antenna components are treated as a discontinuity and their intervening effects in the measurement accuracy are eliminated."
"In applications of electrically short antennas such as multiturn loops, variations in ohmic losses due to proximity effects can significantly affect uncorrected estimates of efficiency. This paper investigates experimentally the proximity effects on the current distributions and associated ohmic losses for two identical parallel rectangular cross-section conductors as a function of separation distance and cross section. Based upon the experimental results, a first-order theory is developed and verified."
"Although the impulse response and complex spectral frequency response are mathematically equivalent, their measurement for wide-band antennas and probes is quite different in the equipment required, calibration and experimental procedure, and in the character of experimental errors. The subject of this communication is an automated facility for measurement of both time- and frequency-domain antenna response data, and a comparison of the results obtained by the two techniques."
"A relatively small cylindrical chamber is described which provides the capability to simulate the operational impedance characteristics of a whip antenna throughout the frequency range 30-76 MHz. This chamber, which does not contain tuning elements, is made of an aluminum cylinder with the inner surface lined with a highly absorbing ferrite tile. To adjust the impedance-Controlling networks of a wide-band whip antenna, the top portion of the antenna whip is replaced by a metal disc and the assembly positioned axially within the chamber. The use of this chamber greatly simplifies tuning and power testing of the impedance-controlling networks of wide-band whip antennas."
"The antenna arrays considered in this paper consist of identical parallel dipoles equally spaced around and perpendicular to a circle. Application of the \"method of moments\" to the analysis problem yields a matrix description of the array. Economies of computation are achieved by exploiting the array symmetries. The matrix description of the array leads to a network description for feed design and a relationship between principalH-plane pattern synthesis and pattern synthesis for an array of point sources. Some classes of pattern synthesis problems are considered and calculated examples presented."
"The input impedance of a spacecraft-borne electric antenna operating below approximately 30 kHz in the ionosphere is investigated with emphasis on sheath effects. The impedance concept is generalized to be applicable to nonlinear antenna-magnetoplasma systems. Explicit formulas are obtained for the generalized impedance of a near cylindrical antenna taking into account the effects of large signal excitation, induced electromotive forces due to antenna motion across the Earth's magnetic field, the influence of the ion collection surface of the space vehicle, and of dc bias between antenna and vehicle. Comparison is made of the pertinent part of the theory and LOFTI-IIA satellite data."
"A method is developed for the maximization of the forward gain of a Yagi-Uda array by adjusting the interelement spacings. The effects of a finite dipole radius and the mutual coupling between the elements are taken into consideration. Currents in the array elements are approximated by three-term expansions with complex coefficients which convert the governing integral equations into simultaneous algebraic equations. The array gain is maximized by the repeated application of a perturbation procedure which converges rapidly to yield a set of optimum, generally unequal, element spacings. This method eliminates the need for a haphazard trial-and-error approach or for interpreting a vast data collection. Illustrative examples are given."
"A new method is presented for calculating near-field antenna gain correction factors directly from measured far-field pattern data by using a spherical wave expansion of the pattern. This eliminates the need for any assumptions regarding antenna aperture field distributions. The only significant assumption in the new method is to neglect multiple scattering between the antennas. The method is applied to the case of a horn antenna. Calculated results are compared to direct measured results, demonstrating agreement to within 0.03 dB. The method is also compared to the method of Chu and Semplak, with similar agreement. The sensitivity of the results to truncation error and noise in the data is also investigated and contrasted to sensitivity of prior methods to errors in the assumed field distribution."
"The method of moments [1], [2] is applied to wire antenna near-field problems. Within the general method, two computational procedures are developed. Results of these are compared with those of certain approximate analytical techniques and also with those of other investigators. A treatment for junctions is outlined. Examples are included for a single dipole antenna, for linear arrays of dipoles and also for loop andT-junction radiators."
 "The experimental development of a 1:6.535 scale model line feed for the Arecibo spherical reflector is described. The 14.7-ft long model at 2810 MHz simulates a 96.6-ft feed at 430 MHz capable of illuminating the full 1000-ft aperture of the reflector. The feed design requirements are discussed and an experimental program is outlined in which the necessary line source parameters were established using a number of leaky cylindrical test sections. Experimental measurements of both the near and far fields of the model feed are described and typical results are quoted and discussed. Finally, some results obtained after installation of a full size feed in the reflector are given and compared with predictions based on the model data."
"The use of satellite differential Doppler measurements to study latitudinal variations ofF-region electron density is described. It is shown that the ambiguity in the total phase path length may be resolved employing either incoherent scatter radar measurements or vertical-incidence ionosonde data, together with some assumptions concerning east-west gradients at the latitude of the observing station. Sample results are given showing the location of the midlatitude trough of electron density observed at Millstone Hill through observations of the U.S. Navy Navigation Series satellites."
"This work presents preliminary results on attempts to map winds of a storm at long range (500 to 1000 nmi) over a large area (10^{5}mi2) in the North Atlantic from the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory, HF radar research facilities at Chesapeake Beach, Md. [1] It appears that the short time response of the sea surface to local winds can be mapped by the analysis of a matrix of range-azimuth records containing frequency power spectra of HF radar signals backscattered from the sea surface via the ionosphere. This paper presents such a map based upon the ratio of the strengths of the first-order contributions to the backscatter spectrum (the approach-recede first-order Bragg lines) and is compared qualitatively with a U. S. Weather Bureau map of the area."
"A broad-band antenna element and beam-forming matrix have been developed for reception of signals at 25-100 MHz. The element is a zig-zag log-periodic antenna with a nominal impedance of430\\Omegaand a VSWR of less than 1.9. The matrix utilizes time-delay gradients to obtain frequency-independent beam positions and also allows several different beam positions to be monitored simultaneously. Observations of natural radio sources using a 16-element array have verified its usefulness."
"Based on the geometrical theory of diffraction, equivalent filamentary currents are derived for a linear element of a surface singularity for general incidence and polarization. The currents are used to obtain an analytical expression for the bistatic field diffracted by a ring singularity, valid within the caustic region as well as at wide angles."
"A method of inferring microwave antenna radiation patterns over wide bandwidths from a series of subnanosecond pulse measurements is described. Monochromatic patterns can be inferred from the time-domain measurements with simple apparatus. Results are presented which show that the method is inherently insensitive to errors caused by reflections from the environment."
"Ever-increasing antenna frequency bandwidth requirements for countermeasures applications and electromagnetic compatibility measurements have provided the impetus for the development of a series of very broad-band horns. In addition to the broad bandwidth, a substantial reduction in axial length over that of earlier models has been achieved for the two designs discussed in this communication. The first horn described covers the frequency range from 1.0-12.0 GHz with the flared portion of the horn having an axial length of 6 in as compared with 12 in for an earlier model. Although horn antennas are not commonly considered for use at frequencies as low as 0.2 GHz, the short axial length design appeared to be an attractive approach in developing a very reasonably sized antenna operating in the 0.2-2.0 GHz range. The technique of fabricating theHplane walls in the form of a grid was used in both designs as a means of maintaining the requiredH-plane half-power beamwidths. The grid for the 1.0-12.0 GHz horn is of printed circuit form while the grid elements of the lower frequency horn are made of aluminum tubing. Electrical characteristics of both designs are presented, as well as some additional data for recent advances which indicate that a further reduction in axial length or an increase in bandwidth can be achieved with only a moderate rise in VSWR in the lower portion of the frequency range."
"Closed-form expressions are derived for the input impedanceZof a small loop antenna with arbitrary orientation in a cold collisionless uniform multicomponent magnetoplasma. The closed-forms results ofZare compared with numerical results from a full-wave formal solution. It is found that for small loops these approximate formulas adequately represent the loop input impedance."
"The impedance properties of a waveguide longitudinal slot antenna of arbitrary length and offset in guide walls of finite thickness are investigated. These properties are obtained by treating the slot discontinuity as an electromagnetic boundary value problem and the resulting pair of coupled integral equations are solved by numerical techniques. Results are given for slots having lengths from0.35\\lambdato1.7\\lambdaand are in good agreement with experimental results."
"A formula is developed for estimating the far-field beamwidth of an arbitrary narrow-beam phased array of identical isotropic elements at a single frequency. Equations are developed for the effects of errors in the estimated positions of the array elements."
"For a radiating linear antenna, the loading ofM + Nappropriate impedances atM + Nspecified locations can lead to: 1) producingM + Ndesired currents atM + Nspecified points along the antenna, 2) producingM + Ndesired radiation fields inM + Nspecified directions, 3) maintaining desired input impedances atM + Ndifferent frequencies, or 4) any linear combination of cases 1), 2), and 3). WithM + Npure reactive loadings, only(M + N)/2values of antenna characteristics can be specified. A method was developed to solve the nonlinear equations in the analysis."

"Gored umbrella parabolic reflectors with symmetric aperture illumination have been treated analytically in a recent paper. This communication extends the analysis to the case where the primary feed illumination is not symmetric, because real primary feeds usually have unequalE- andH-plane beamwidths. The gore loss and the shift in the defocusing curve obtained using the modified gain expression are in excellent agreement with values measured for a smooth parabolic reflector and a gore parabolic reflector of the same diameter."
"It is well known that there is no direct one-to-one correspondence between the electromagnetic theory based on the physical laws and that based on the Maxwell's differential equations. For example, in order to derive the boundary conditions from the Maxwell's differential equations, one assumes that some integral identities derived from them are valid even when the field components (or material parameters) are discontinuous. This assumption violates, in a sense, the completeness of the theory of electromagnetism based on the Maxwell's differential equations. We will prove that if one postulates that the Maxwell's equations are valid in the sense of distributions, then this incompleteness will be removed and the boundary conditions will appear implicitly in the basic differential equations."
"When the coordinates of a line source are assigned complex values in the free-space Green's function, the resulting field represents a bounded beam. This property is employed to formulate an integral expression for the field transmitted across a plane dielectric interface. Asymptotic evaluation of the integral requires detailed study of the saddle point and steepest descent path configurations, especially when the incident beam is totally reflected. The asymptotic results in that case are employed to chart the power flow lines and to deduce the lateral shift of the reflected beam."
"The generalized spectral Fourier method is applied to the investigation of scattering of plane electromagnetic waves from rough oscillating surfaces. The surface is characterised in terms of surface impedance formulation. The relationships between radar cross section and the spatial and temporal spectrum of the surface are obtained. The backscatter radar cross section is determined using phillips ocean scatter."
"This communication compares the differences between the quasi-coherent and incoherent components of microwave transhorizon signals where the differences are exhibited in the received-signal characteristics in several respects: the distribution of the signal level, the shape of the antenna response patterns, and the width of the RF Doppler spectrum. These differences are also accompanied by corresponding differences in the meterological profiles. There is a clear implication that the atmospheric structure giving rise to the transhorizon scatter of the propagated radio wave is markedly different for each case. The important point of this work is that the distinctions between the quasi-coherent and incoherent components of the signal are revealed in independently measured quantities."
"In this paper, a more general form of Babinet's principle for electromagnetic waves and perfectly conducting screens with apertures covered by resistive sheets is presented. It shows that the field components parallel to the screens are now further related to one another by the resistance of the resistive sheets whereas the field components normal to the screens retain the same relationship as in the absence of the resistive sheets."

"The radiation pattern of the Yagi antenna is optimized by the conjugate-direction method. The actual solution of the integral equation for current distribution is used throughout the optimization. A study of several Yagi antennas optimized by Morris shows that, for fixed distances between elements, the directivity cannot be improved further, but the sidelobes can be reduced by as much as 10 dB."

"Starting from the dispersion relation corresponding to TM modes in the rest system and relativistic transformations, dispersion relation corresponding to TM mode, is derived in the moving system. The plasma is assumed to be homogeneous, compressible, and uniaxial in the presence of strong TM field. From the wave equation corresponding to TE modes in the moving system, it is concluded that the dispersion relation corresponding to TE modes is independent of the temperature of plasma and is the same as that for ordinary air-filled parallel-plane waveguide in the presence of strong TM field. The magnetic field has no effect on air filled guide. The dispersion relation corresponding to TEM modes is also derived."
"High-frequency scattering by a perfectly conductingN-noded pyramid is investigated. The principally polarized radar cross section is derived by integrating the wedge diffracted fields around the pyramid base termination. Theoretical results are compared to measurements at circular as well as the two linear polarizations and seem to be in reasonable agreement for aspect angles out to the pyramid half-angle."
"The electromagnetic field excited by an electric or magnetic line source in the vicinity of an inhomogeneous dielectric layer is considered. The variation in permittivity across the layer is essentially arbitrary. Expressing the fields in the layer in terms of solutions to the Hill equation yields exact integral representations for the fields reflected and transmitted by the layer. These are evaluated approximately using the saddle point technique. Expressions are given for the reflected and transmitted fields and the amplitude of the lateral wave. The characteristic equation for the bound waves is determined. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the behavior of the radiated fields, the lateral wave, and the surface waves as the permittivity profile is varied."
"An exact problem of electromagnetic inverse scattering is considered for which the target characteristics of unknown two-dimensional cylindrical scatterers need to be determined, given the incident and the scattered fields everywhere and assuming that the laws governing the interaction satisfy the Leontovich condition. The novel set of inverse boundary conditions, resulting from the inversion of this impedance boundary condition, is employed to recover the electrical size, the surface locus, and the averaged local surface impedance directly from the total near-field expressions. The analysis is verified by computation for circular cylindrical monobody and twobody shapes assuming mixed polarized normal plane wave incidence. Particular emphasis is given to coordinate origin displacement, series truncation, and Fourier coefficient accuracy error analysis."
"The method of modal expansions is a fundamental technique for solving the electromagnetic boundary value problems. As its practical alogrithm, the point-matching method has been used but frequently failed. A new computer-aided procedure based on the method of modal expansions is presented and applied to the scattering from a periodic structure composed of a perfectly conducting surface. As an example, the scattering from the grating with a sinusoidal height profile is calculated. It is demonstrated numerically that the new procedure leads to desirable results, while the point-matching method does not. Several physical characteristics on the reflection grating including the diffraction anomalies are explored."
"A technique is developed for measuring the rms wave height averaged over an area of the sea that is much greater than any horizontal scale of the surface waves. The method involves a nadir looking radar which transmits and receives two monochromatic signals simultaneously. Signal processing at the receiver involves the computation of the correlation between the two returning signals as a function of theft variable frequency separation. The cross correlation between the amplitude and phase functions of the individual returning carriers depends on the distribution of discrete scatterers along the direction of propagation. This information can be used to determine the rms surface elevation (about the mean); it does not depend on the temporal or spatial frequency spectrum of the wave height or slope. Under conditions which are typical for a microwave signal being normally incident and reflected by the sea, the two frequency correlation functionR(\\Delta k)is seen to be equal to the characteristic function of the surface elevation of specular points. Laboratory measurements have been conducted on wind driven waves, and the measured correlation function compares favorably with the theory developed here."
"In the near field of the Arecibo spherical antenna radar system, i.e., at ranges less than about 260 km, the gain is a function of range and a knowledge of gain is necessary for deducing electron-density information from the power backscattered from the ionosphere. A method of obtaining the phase taper across the aperture (and hence the near-field on-axis and backscatter gains versus range), given a knowledge of the far-field on-axis gain versus frequency, and the amplitude of the illumination over the aperture is suggested. Our studies show that measurements of on-axis far-field gain over a bandwidth of\\pm7MHz are adequate to give an accurate indication of on-axis gain versus range in the near field, while a\\pm15MHz frequency spread is needed to give accurate information on the backscatter gain versus range. The near-field correction for the antenna has also been estimated from measurements made on a model of the new line feed. Confidence in the validity of this approach has been obtained by comparing the measured far-field on-axis gain versus frequency with that calculated using the data from the model feed."
"Computational procedures have recently been developed which accurately determine the excitation (including mutual coupling effects) at each element of a closely spaced array enabling it to perform in some desired manner. A procedure for designing a transmission-line feed network capable of realizing these required excitations is described. The result is a narrow-band feed system composed simply of a transmission line together with a small number of stubs. A comparison between theoretical and experimental results is given."
"The roll-plane radiation patterns of on-aircraft antennas are analyzed using high-frequency solutions. This is a basic study of aircraft-antenna pattern performance in which the aircraft is modeled in its most basic form. The fuselage is assumed to be a perfectly conducting circular cylinder with the antennas mounted near the top or bottom. The wings are simulated by arbitrarily many-sided flat plates and the engines by circular cylinders. The patterns in each case are verified by measured results taken on simple models as well as scale models of actual aircraft."
"Motivated by a study of the electrical properties of deep polar ice, a technique was developed to interpret the measured admittance of an electrically short sheathed dipole probe in terms of the complex relative permittivity of the surrounding material. With the related analytical problem unsolved, the experimental study described herein provides new information for evaluating theoretical models as well as guidelines for the full-scale design of systems to measure the properties of ice or other materials in similar circumstances, and bounds on the measured sample volume. Reduction of the admittance data is accomplished with the aid of a three-element equivalent circuit resulting from a laboratory model study that is also described. Potential applications include measure-merit of the in situ properties of rock and naturally occurring ice masses surrounding deep drill holes. Preliminary results from the Antarctic ice sheet at Byrd Station are included by way of illustration."
"The conventional asymptotic theory for propagation of high-frequency fields is based on a local description in terms of homogeneous plane wavesA(r) exp [ik_{0}S(r)], wherek_{0}is the (large) free space wavenumber,A(r)is a spatially dependent amplitude, and the phaseS(r)is real. The conventional theory does not accommodate the more general class of fields that behave locally like inhomogeneous plane waves with complex phaseS(r)= R(r) + iI(r), whereRdetermines the propagation of the equiphase surfaces andIdescribes the attenuation. This paper develops an asymptotic theory for inhomogeneous wave fields in lossless media, to be termed evanescent fields. Such fields are encountered, for example, in connection with Gaussian beams and with phenomena on the exterior of surface wave structures or on the dark side of caustics. The scalar wave equation is used to derive eikonal and transport equations forSandA, respectively, and it is shown how the latter equations may be integrated with the aid of trajectories tangent to the direction of\\nablaR, which differs slightly from that for the local power flow. Detailed application of the theory is made to two-dimensional scattering of a weakly evanescent incident plane wave by a curved boundary in a homogeneous medium. The phase propagation paths for the reflected field are determined explicitly and are found to possess curvature and points of inflection; these characteristics are shown to be predictable from basic attributes of evanescent wave propagation. For the special case of a circular cylinder, the subsequently constructed reflected field is found to agree with the asymptotic expansion of the rigorous solution, thereby confirming the validity of the theory for weakly evanescent fields. The rigorous solution, valid for arbitrary evanescent decay and obtained from known results for ordinary plane wave scattering by analytic continuation of the incidence angle to complex values, reveals that both the reflected and creeping wave fields should be viewed in a restrictive manner when the evanescent decay is large. However, for weak evanescent decay, these fields retain their customary significance and permit their construction by local evanescent field tracking. It is interesting to observe that in contrast to the nonevanescent case, the creeping waves provide a field contribution exceeding that of the incident or reflected waves in certain portions of the illuminated region."
"The problem of a horizontal loop antenna located above a stratified dissipative half-space is investigated. Current distribution is formally obtained by cosinusoidal expansion around the loop. The effect of the lower half-space on each modal current is discussed in the case of a small loop (k_{0}b = 0.3) and a resonant loop (k_{0}b = 1). Change in input admittance as a function of height and as a function of the electric parameters of a homogeneous dissipative haft-space are presented. Such change is found to be very pronounced when the loop is close to the interface and when the loop is near resonance. The effect of a second layer in the lower half-space is then discussed."
"Particularly simple quadratic forms are derived for the self- and mutual-admittances of delta gaps in thin wire structures in terms of the characteristic currents of the structures. Results based on these forms are found to be in substantial agreement with those derived by other methods."
"Ground losses of HF antennas situated near the earth's surface are reduced if single antennas are replaced by small arrays of, for example, two or four closely spaced radiating elements. It is shown both theoretically and experimentally that an array spacing of\\sim 0.1 \\lambdais sufficient to achieve significant improvement in ground-to-ground transmission efficiency. In particular in the lower HF range and for poorly conducting ground, the improvement approaches a theoretical limit equal to the number of elements in the array."
"A circular corrugated waveguide can be used to design single-horn monopulse feeds with relatively wide bandwidth. The dominant hybrid mode in the corrugated structure provides the reference signal, whereas the error signal for the servodrive is derived from theTM_{01}mode in the usual manner."
"Electromagnetic scattering from a perfectly conducting body of finite extent is considered from an integral equation point of view. It is shown that the operator inverse to the integral operator of the magnetic field formulation is an analytic operator-valued function in the complex frequency plane except at certain points (the natural frequencies) where it has poles. Furthermore, a representation of the inverse operator in terms of the natural frequencies and the nontrivial solutions of the homogeneous integral equation is given. Explicit expressions for the scattered field in terms of exponentially damped sinusoidal oscillations are given for the special case where the incident wave is a delta-function plane wave and the inverse operator has only simple poles."
"The scattering of an electromagnetic wave from a conducting cylinder clad with an anisotropic plasma of arbitrary electron density is considered, and the eigenfunction solution is obtained. The resonant behavior of the system is investigated. The resonant conditions are obtained, and damping of the resonant scattering by finite size effects and collisional dissipation is studied. The Rayleigh and geometrical optics limiting cases are derived, and the approach of the plasma scattering to that from a metallic body for increasing plasma frequency (electron density) is obtained. Comparisons with the scattering from an unclad cylinder and from a planar conductor sheathed with a plasma are made."
"Square-waveguide elements capable of radiating and receiving any of four different sets of dual polarizations were considered. Each element may consist of as many as 8 matching sections of square waveguide in tandem. The known solution to a \"standard\" phased-array problem was used to synthesize the solution for the many-junction element, and a computer program was developed to implement the solution. A systematic investigation of the performance characteristics of large dual-polarization phased arrays of square waveguides was carried out. Coupling between radiated polarizations and active reflection coefficient were computed for two wide-bandwidth (20 and 25 percent of center frequency) designs for dual-linear, dual-circular, and dual-scanned polarization states. A simple design procedure that yields well-matched practical elements with high polarization isolation was developed. Various phenomena peculiar to dual-polarization excitation were identified and are discussed. The theoretical predictions are supported by experimental evidence obtained by means of two infinite-array simulators and a 267-element array."
"The problem of an infinitely long coaxial cylinder with a single circumferential slot in the sheath is investigated analytically. When the slot width is small compared with the radius of the outer cylinder, an exact integral equation for the aperture field is formulated and subsequently solved by a quasi-static technique. Equivalent circuit representation of the coupling between the outside antenna and the inside coaxial line is obtained in closed form. Due to the highly localized nature of the coupling, the result thus obtained is applicable to finite cylindrical antenna with multiple feed slots."
"There is a need for high gain antennas that are capable of rapid scanning and multibeam operations. This paper presents a study of the double-spherical Cassegrain reflector to ascertain whether this antenna is practical for these purposes. Aperture blocking, spread of the field, and phase and amplitude distributions are examined using geometric optical techniques. Some radiation patterns are calculated to show the effects of illumination taper, aperture blocking, and phase errors."
"A double impedance loading technique is applied in the study of a parasitic array of two loaded short antennas, Approximate solutions for the currents in the array elements are obtained. It is demonstrated that the current distributions in the array elements can be appropriately modified by optimum impedance loadings to achieve significant improvement in radiated power or directivity. Theoretical predictions are verified closely by the results of an experimental study."
"The theory of scattering of electromagnetic plane waves of arbitrary incidence and polarization from an infinite rectangular-mesh ground screen is treated. The screen is composed of thin wires of circular cross section, and is parallel to the interface between two homogeneous media. The theoretical results for parallel-wire screens are obtained in the limit of large wire spacing for one dimension of the mesh screen. Results presented for incident parallel polarized plane waves indicate that both the parallel-wire and mesh screens may exhibit a change in reflecting properties as the plane of incidence is varied from the wire axis direction. In addition, it is shown that the parallel-wire screen can produce appreciably higher cross-polarized fields than a square-mesh screen of the same wire spacing."

A seven-beam model antenna 1.98 m in diameter has been fabricated and evaluated in the 50-GHz frequency band, and the measurement data are reported here."
"A new formula for calculating the directivity of a phased antenna array with limited scan angle is presented. The elements are directive and have interelement spacings so large that grating lobes appear."
"In an active phased array (i.e., an array that has amplifiers in each element) transmitting multiple beams, the intermodulation products generated by the amplifier amplitude nonlinearities form beams that, in general, radiate in directions different from the principal beam directions. In effect, the phased array antenna spatially filters the intermodulation products formed by signals from different beams. In a communications application this effect can be used to reduce the signal-to-intermodulation interference ratio. A description of this phenomenon is given and examples are presented that illustrate the mainbeam directions of beams formed by third- and fifth-order intermodulation products. An experiment that was performed to demonstrate this effect is described. The spatial filtering effect for beams with amplitude modulated signals is also treated, with an improvement in carrier-to-intermodulation ratio theoretically demonstrated."
"An asymptotic series is described suitable for the evaluation of the early time response in a transient problem. Once the solution in the frequency domain is known in certain forms of ascending series of frequency (including optical, diffracted, and creeping waves), asymptotic formulas are developed to \"translate\" it readily into the time domain."
"A numerical method is proposed for computing the normalized correlation functions of the real and imaginary parts of the field scattered from a statistically rough perfectly conducting circular cylinder. The deviation of the surface from its mean radius is assumed to be small. The correlation function of the far-field is related to the correlation function of the scattering object by an integral equation. Far-field correlation functions are found for two types of surface correlation functions: the delta function and a periodic exponential function."
"A previous derivation of the transition field on the surface of a slot-excited conical antenna is corrected, and the new result as well as the tip-diffraction coefficient are checked by a calculation involving only the exact normal-mode series."
"The radiation resistance of a short current filament situated along the distinguished axis in a uniaxially anisotropic drifting magnetoplasma medium is evaluated for the case of a triangular distribution of current. The correction to the radiation resistance arising from a vanishingly small drift velocity of the plasma is found to be given by an additive term, which is essentially proportional to the drift velocity."
"This communication addresses the problem of estimating the minimum size a phased-array antenna must have in order that analyses based on simple infinite-array models yield meaningful results. The measure of array size proposed herein is an efficiency parameter defined for an infinite array with truncated excitations. Numerical results are presented for arrays of slots and dipoles, showing the rate of convergence of the efficiency parameter for various spacings and scan angles. The conclusions deduced from this analysis as to the minimum array size are in substantial agreement with exact computations dealing with finite arrays published in the literature."
"By structurally changing the rim of reflector antennas, reduction of radiation is achieved in the shadow region. An experimental approach is used based on the concepts of edge diffraction theory."
"Two isotropic antenna systems for detection of electromagnetic waves have been developed, and graphs of sensitivity versus angle of rotation of antennas about three mutually perpendicular axes have been recorded. The two types of antenna systems had approximately constant sensitivity for incident waves with arbitrary linear polarization. These antenna systems consist of 12 crystal-diode detectors on the surface of a sphere and six crystal-diode detectors on six edges of a tetrahedron. The spherical antenna system is the more omnidirectional of the two when the antenna system is approximately one-third wavelength in diameter or resonant. When the dimensions were reduced to less than one-tenth wavelength, the pyramidal antenna system was most omnidirectional. The immediate concern was to design detectors for the safety of workers near high-power microwave sources and probes for detection of excessive leakage from microwave ovens in the home."
"The variation of VLF propagation characteristics of the earth-ionosphere waveguide with change in dip angle is examined in the light of mode coupling and the penetration of the electromagnetic fields into the ionosphere. The above information is obtained as a function of the dip angle by solving coupled vacuum-mode equations for a cylindrical model of the earth-ionosphere waveguide. Propagation in the West-East (WE) and East-West (EW) directions for data corresponding to the first two modes is considered. The range of dip angles20\\deg-35\\degin which the solution of the modal equation is discontinuous is found to be characterized by very low reflection coefficients for the parallel polarized waves, and a deep penetration of the fields into the ionosphere. A comparison of the characteristics of the electromagnetic fields between WE and EW directions of propagations is made. Of the two modes which are predominantly TE modes, the WE mode is seen to have a deeper penetration of the fields, while the TM mode has a deeper penetration for the two modes in the EW direction. Plots of upgoing and downcoming components of electric fields in the ionosphere corresponding to the first two modes for WE and EW directions of propagation are given for various dip angles."
"An examination is made of the reflection mechanism of VLF radio waves in the inhomogeneous-anisotropic lower ionosphere. The full-wave numerical results are compared with the case of the isotropic ionosphere and then with the ray theory concept."
"When computing the characteristic modes of a symmetric conducting body, it is always advantageous and sometimes absolutely necessary to block diagonalize the matrix representation of the operator for the eigencurrents. This procedure reduces computation time and memory requirements. The formal theoretical approach to operator block diagonalization is developed using group theory. It is shown that the operator for the eigencurrents on a conducting body is invariant under the group of symmetry operations of the structure. The eigencurrents are shown to provide bases for the irreducible representations of the symmetry group. It is further proven that expansion of the current in terms of functions belonging to the irreducible representations of the symmetry group of the structure leads to block diagonalization of the matrix representation of the operator. Basis functions for bodies of revolution are discussed as an example."
"One-dimensional inverse-scattering theory is applied to the study of the reflection of electromagnetic waves from an inhomogeneous region having a refractive indexn(x) = [1-(1/k^{2})q(x)]^{1/2}wherek = 2\\pi/\\lambda, and\\lambdais the free-space wavelength. The exact refractive index profile is obtained that will produce a reflection coefficient in which the frequency dependence is described by the Butterworth approximation."
"The integral representations for the field components are evaluated numerically and compared with often used asymptotic formulas. It is found that the latter have a limited range of validity when the substratum is highly resistive. In general, the distance to the source cable must be allowed for in the interpretation of the observed fields."
"Parametric interactions between a sonic pump wave and a weak Alfven wave are studied. It is shown that if the Alfven-wave velocityV_{A}is small relative to the sonic-wave velocityV_{s}there is a time-growing instability leading to the increase of the Alfven wave at the expense of the sonic wave. This phenomenon can be of importance in solar and stellar physics. ForV_{A}large relative toV_{s}, the interaction is of the stop-band type."

  "The telephone system is a great national resource, and the Lovell alarm system is one proposal to utilize the telephone as an inexpensive alarm arrangement in the densely populated metropolitan centers. The operation of a sensor or a button on the customer's premises would transmit the telephone number immediately from the telephone central office to the alarm bureau. This is accomplished by piggybacking the alarm service on the individual line much as if it were a two party line. The alarm service does not interfere with the use of the line for normal telephone individual line service and only minor changes are required at the telephone central office."

                  "An inverse problem of continuous wave electromagnetic scattering is considered. It is assumed that the incident and scattered fields are given everywhere and that the material surface properties satisfy the Leontovich boundary condition. Applying the novel concept of electromagnetic inverse boundary conditions it is shown how the shape and the averaged local surface impedance for spherical two-body scattering geometries can exactly be recovered. An important novel contribution is the introduction of analytic continuation methods in three dimensions."

The ray-tracing methods used account for the polarization, energy density, pathlength (phase) and wavefront curvature information associated with each ray, so that the resulting surface currents and aperture field distributions are accurate within the basic geometric optics approximation. Up to six surfaces (regular or deformed) may be used in the ray-trace analysis. Rays which miss reflectors and/or the aperture plane, or are blocked, are accounted for. Far-field patterns are computed from either \"wavefront\" approximations in the aperture plane or current distributions on the final reflector surface using standard integral representations. The user is given a wide choice of options for input of fields and surfaces and outputs both of far-field and intermediate fields and currents."

             "The major function of G-AP the is to provide a forum for the dissemination of technical information that is principally scientific and educational. In order for published material to be of significant engineering value, theory should be supported by experiment, or at least a graphical presentation, disadvantages as well as advantages should be discussed and mathematical treatments should be supported by example. Those papers which provide these desirable ingredients should be given first priority and should constitute the bulk of the information reported. Finally, it is argued that to serve their needs and to recognize their practical accomplishments, the G-AP should realign its course and serve firstly the engineering community and secondly the academic community."
"In most geologic environments the electrical conductivity is sufficiently high that useful electromagnetic sounding is restricted to low frequencies where diffusion of energy into the earth is dominant. In some environments the resistivity is sufficiently high that it is possible to get considerable depths of penetration using frequencies in the 1 Mhz to 100 Mhz range so that one can deal with conventional wave propagation. One such material is ice which behaves as a dielectric with a frequency-dependent loss. The dielectric constant is typically about 3.2 - 3.3 and the loss tangent is typically\\frac{0.2 - 0.4}{f}wherefis in Mhz. By measuring the field strength as a function of distance from a fixed transmitter it is possible to detect interference between the surface wave, the subsurface wave and any reflections. This gives a determination of dielectric constant, loss tangent and depth to reflectors."

          "For many years, The Geometrical Theory of Difraction (GTD) has been applied to antenna and scattering problems for which the structure is large in terms of wavelength. GTD solutions have mainly been concerned with pattern computations with little information concerning antenna impedance and/or aperture distributions. This is especially true for wire-type antennas. On the other hand, The Method of Moment (MM) has been applied to such problems for which the structure is small in terms of wavelength. This paper presents a technique which can be used to combine these two solutions such that a whole host of new problems can be handled."
     "The adaptive array process is cast into a constrained optimization problem in the spectral domain. Basically, the process allows the array to maintain constant gain in a desired look-direction while simultaneously rejecting undersired interference. The solution to the problem leads to two versions of a \"spectral-domain constrained least-mean-squares\" (SD-CLMS) iterative algorithm. Convergence considerations lead to optimization of the algorithm in the noiseless case. Smoothing techniques are recommended for the noisy case. A numerical example is included."

   "The singularity expansion method is employed to determine the transient response of a thin-wire scatterer arbitrarily oriented above an infinite perfectly conducting ground plane. An integro-differential equation is formulated for the current on the scatterer in terms of the complex frequency,s=\\sigma+j\\omega. The method of moments is used to reduce this integro-differential equation to a system of linear algebraic equations. The singularity expansion method is then applied to determine the exterior natural resonances and the transient response of the scatterer to a unit step incident wave. The analytical and numerical techniques used to obtain the various terms in the singularity expansion representation of the transient response are discussed, and results are presented for several different orientations of the scatterer with respect to the ground plane."

Comparison is made between this instrument and a photographic nephelometer used routinely in the deep ocean."
"A possible source of trouble with electronic assemblies that are operated in a dielectric oil for pressure tolerant electronic (PTE) systems is the solution of ions in the oil environment. This possible source of trouble was identified in control experiments performed on commercially available petroleum and silicone-base oils. These experiments included measurements of the solubility, resistivity, and dielectric constant of saturated solutions of ionic species of chemical compounds dissolved in these oils. The results of the control experiments were compared with the neutron activation and dielectric analyses that were conducted on an oil that has been in service for two years in a PTE system. On the basis of these results, device surface inversion and corrosion resulting from these concentrations of oil-soluble ions, were assessed theoretically. The evaluations and conclusions pertain to semiconductor devices and materials in PTE systems."
"Acousticore is a technique for quantitative measurement of the specific acoustic impedance of marine sediments. A broadband impulsive source and two colinear receivers of fixed spacing are oriented vertically. Acoustic pressure received at the two points is used to compute downgoing and upgoing waveforms which are, in turn, numerically deconvolved to obtain the reflection impulse-response function of sediments below the device. Theoretical relationships are presented between the reflection impulse-response function and sediment acoustic impedance which assume horizontal homogeneity but allow for arbitrary vertical variations including continuous change in impedance. If the range of impedance variation is modest (perhaps 2:1), e.g., in \"normal\" unconsolidated sediments, the theoretical relationship is simply:\\int\\max{t}\\min{0}h(u)du=1/2 ln[z(t)/z_{0}]where (t) is the reflection impulse-response function and z(t) is impedance as a function of acoustic travel time. Marine sediments encompass a spectrum of impedances, as substantiated by published data regarding acoustic properties of sediments. These data, which are summarized here, show that quantitative measurement of impedance is useful for discrimination between consolidated sediments, gravel, sand, clay, silt, and gassy sediments. In the case of gassy sediments we obtain an undissolved gas percentage profile versus depth (acoustic travel time). Laboratory and field data are shown illustrating the Acousticore technique and its ability to measure acoustic impedance versus depth for multi-layered sediments."

The electronic and optical design considerations of the light system are described."

The Shipborne Water Quality Monitoring System is capable of performing its mission in areas such as estuaries, rivers, and ocean waters."
"This report presents additional results obtained after the presentation of the report entitled, \"An Optimal Maintenance Policy for Deep Submergence Equipment,\" at OCEAN 72. In the model of the deep submergence equipment, it is assumed the following assumptions hold: (1) the system deteriorates with time and finally fails to operate; (2) it is impossible either to repair the system or to observe its level of deterioration without bringing it to the surface; (3) even in a badly deteriorated state, the system can perform its function although with a substantial loss; (4) the observation and repair of the system are quite expensive because of assumption (2). The previous paper presented at OCEAN 72 deals with an optimal maintenance policy of the system for which the operating duration is assumed to be given and finite, while this report deals with one for infinite operating duration."
"A number of high-speed correlator structures appropriate for the processing of signals in sonar and communication systems are described. Various combinations of shift registers, exclusive/ORs, charge-coupled devices, and acoustic surface-wave devices can be used to implement, in modular form, M-bit-vs-binary, M-bit-vs-N-bit, or analog-vs-N-bit correlators and matched filters. Programmability of both channels provides a very flexible type of matched filter whose configuration can be organized by computer control. Various modes of operation of the correlator structures appropriate for signal processing applications, including the programmable matched filter mode and the alternate-shift cross-correlator mode, are discussed along with associated oscilloscope photographs of experimental results using laboratory prototype equipment."
"In this work a bottom return signal model and accompanying signal processor are described for a wide swath bottom mapping system. An incoherent scattering model is employed under the assumptions that the bottom is a random rough surface composed of a large number of independent scatterers with spatial correlation distance negligible relative to the ensonified area. The signal received from the various spatial directions is modeled as a smooth, nearly-Gaussian-shaped function representing the effects of the two-way spatial beam pattern, angle of incidence, and depth corrupted by multiplicative and additive noise stochastic processes. A signal processor is derived which makes use of the a priori information vested in this smooth function to provide a matched-filter for the received signal envelope for each spatial direction. Computer simulation results are presented and the performance of the signal processor examined in a qualitative fashion."
"For many reasons, e.g., port operations, coastal construction planning, undersea structure survival, underwater transport, man wishes to know the extreme values that are likely to occur in physical oceanographic variables. This paper presents a hybrid statistics/computer simulation method that uses common oceanographic observations to estimate confidence levels on the most extreme values likely to occur over a given period in the future. The method is applied to the California coast for a period of 100 years on the following variables: wave height by water depth, wave length by water depth, wave period, bottom surge particle velocity by water depth, current velocity, regions of high density, regions of low density, and earthquake magnitude. Values are given for the 99 % and 99.9% probability levels."
"A series of vertical profiles of temperature, salinity and sound speed were made from a surface vessel, using an STD/SV environmental profiling system in water 350 m deep off Southern California. The data were recorded digitally on magnetic tape at 0.2 Hz sample rate. Hydrographic casts were also made to obtain independent measurements of salinity, temperature and depth. The salinity obtained from the STD/SV is0.05\\permilhigher than that found using the hydrographic cast data. This difference appears to have a depth dependence but its nature cannot be clearly established from the present observations. There is also a hysteresis effect in the profiles of the properties measured and is, in part, attributed to internal waves. The presence of internal waves was established during this period from an independent set of temperature measurements, using a vertical thermistor array. The sound speed measured by the STD/SV was compared with the calculated sound speeds using the Anderson, the Frye and Del Grosso sound speed equations and the salinity and temperature data obtained by the STD/SV. The calculated sound speed is found to average 0.35 m/sec higher than the measured sound speed, using the Anderson and Frye equations."
"Summary form only given, as follows. The analysis of ecosystem dynamics in an upwelling area requires continuously sampled data and high sampling rates. The state-ofthe-art is Rosette Samplers and multi-station grids. These at best provide a limited look at the vertical structure of the up-welling zone. The authors have designed and built a towed underway pumping system for the University of Washington, Department of Oceanography's Coastal Upwelling Ecosystems Analysis Group. The system includes a Batfish Model 3000 with a Guildline Model 8103 STD/CTD, noncontaminating submerged pump and a unique faired towing cable. The system is designed to maneuver under command in the top 100 meters of water at speeds to 12 knots while delivering 10 gpm of seawater to the ship for analysis along with salinity, temperature and pressure analog signals from the Batfish."
"Results of a previous model study of drag reduction by electrolysis conducted by the authors are applied to a prototype of a deep submergence hull form for which the model is tenth-scale. The prototype is assumed to operate in salt water where the electrical conductivity is two orders of magnitude greater than that of the fresh water of the model study. The results of the application show that the net power required to propel the 30-foot prototype operating at speeds up to 5 knots in salt water depths to 15,000 feet can be reduced by approximately 70% by using a 1 kw power supply in the drag reduction system."
"An ultrasonic beam normally incident on a water-oil interface is used to characterize the presence of an oil film on ocean surface. The ultrasonic characteristics of oil are also obtained and used to identify the oil, as well as the oil layer thickness or parts per million as the case may be. The ocean surface is assumed to me smooth to within one-eighth of wavelength, and if otherwise, a calibration for that particular surface roughness is used to eliminate the effect of such roughness. The temperature compensation is assumed to be incorporated in the hardware design for such apparatus, since temperature variation of physical parameters is well documented in the literature. The classification task may further be considerably simplified, if the possible types of oil expected in such determination for a given location are specified."
"This paper concerns itself with a special ultrasonic ranging device, which was designed and developed by The Boeing Company, to be used on submerged foil type hydrofoils for measurement and control of the height of the.ship's hull above the water.

Topics discussed include: - Reasons for Selecting Air/Ultrasonic Approach - History of Development - System Description & Theory of Operation - Developmental Problems and Solutions - Operational History"

"The Naval Undersea Center has designed and built eleven different manipulative devices having up to seven independent functions. The most sophisticated of these devices is the Remote Unmanned Work System manipulator which is an all-purpose, seven function master-slave manipulator for light work at depths to 20,000 feet. The master or controller for this manipulator is a 3/4 scale analog. The operator grasps the \"hand\" or terminus of this device and moves it to a desired location and orientation; the hand of the manipulator or slave foliows to a corresponding position. Forces encountered by the manipulator are simulated in the controller giving the operator a form of force feedback. This type of terminus controller possesses several distinct advantages over exoskeletal \"strap-on\" manipulator controllers."
"Small, remotely-manned tethered vehicles have been developed for undersea inspection, surveillance, implantment, and recovery. For many applications such vehicles offer several advantages over diver systems or general purpose submersibles. Some of these are: safety, unlimited endurance, low initial and operating cost, portability, ease of operation and availability of information to control personnel. Some features of the vehicle \"Snoopy\" are closed circuit television, automatic depth control utilizing a variable buoyancy chamber, proportional joystick thruster control, a variable torque grabber, and a compass. \"SCAT,\" a somewhat larger vehicle with greater work capability employs a head-following stereoscopic television and sonar system, automatic depth or altitude control, proportional joystick thruster control, and a two function grabber. A version of Snoopy which is being designed and constructed for deeper operation incorporates a streamlined fiberglass hull and utilizes a single coaxial cable for power and data transmission."

"The creation of special atmospheres for exploration of inner and outer space raises questions relating to control levels and methods for safety and success. This paper discusses the \"solution\" employed in the design and construction of the Ocean Simulation Facility in Panama City, Florida. Because all compounds are not life critical, the problem is simplified by defining two instrumentation categories. Category one involves continuous measurement of constituents vital to short term physiological well being. Category two involves infrequent detection and identification of constituents which may have a long term physiological effect. The instrumentation provided adequately determines the levels of any constituent, but the follow-on control is rudimentary."
"Large angle laser beam scanning was achieved by using holographic technique, and applied to a range finder system. The holographic scanner consists of the rotating drum (1200 rpm) and 50 hologram plates with it and deflects light beam in14\\degholizontally and in6\\deg40' vertically at 1000 scans per sec. Deflected laser beam is reflected back from the target and detected by photomultiplier with the gate circuit. Finally the detected signal is displayed on the cathode ray tube (20 flames/sec). Laser TV system is also constructed using the vibrating mirror scanner. This system is simple, compact and obtainable of clearer pictures."
"A feasibility study for a scanned laser to generate a contour map of the sea floor has been completed. Analysis and experimental test results indicate improved horizontal resolution compared to side scan sonar for ranges to approximately 90 meters in clear water (\\alpha\\leq .05 m^{-1}) and vertical accuracy to 0.75%. The configuration studied performs best in a side-to-side scan below the vehicle and, therefore, can \"fill the gap\" for side scan sonar. The Scanned Laser and Tracking System, SLATS, employs a blue-green laser which scans mechanically in a lateral direction about the nadir. Reflected light from the sea floor is sensed by an integrating image tube which is located a fixed distance from the laser. This receiver registers the location of the laser as the beam sweeps the scene, with range to the sea floor determined by triangulation. Lateral scan of the laser provides one dimension of a raster while forward motion produces the second."
"The system performance of the two improved underwater light sources which have been recently developed at the Naval Undersea Center and other advanced light sources is predicted by computer simulation. System performance is evaluated as a function of source-receiver separation, receiver sensitivity, and the angular extent of the beam pattern of the source in representative samples of coastal and deep ocean waters. A figure of merit is calculated for each combination of light source and television camera to provide a convenient reference for comparing the power limitations of the different systems. In addition, signal to backscatter ratios are calculated to provide data on the backscatter limitations of the different systems."
"The optical attenuation characteristics of deep ocean waters show a broad minimum between 460 nm and 510 nm. Optical sources for underwater applications should emit in this ocean window to minimize the required optical power. To fulfill this need for an efficient source, a new pair of are lamps were developed: zinc-xenon and cadmium-xenon. Performance and engineering data on this type of short-are lamp with various electrode spacings are presented in terms of spectral-emission curves, line widths, electrical characteristics, and conversion efficiencies. Lamp blackening due to the tungsten-water cycle as a limitation to lamp life is discussed. Sample lifetime data indicate lifetimes in excess of 200 hours are realizable."
"Currents induce changes in the travel time of an acoustic signal. This effect can be exploited to measure current velocity. Theoretical calculations are compared with experimental measurements over a 33-km range. Equations and a system layout are presented for measurement of current velocity when the sound speed is spatially variable. Simplifications that are possible when the current direction is known and/or the sound speed is constant are discussed."
"Based on available information on the concentration and size distribution of underwater scatterers, the acoustic scattering cross section of some typical scatterers is estimated. In particular, the scattering characteristics of suspended matter and temperature inhomogeneities are examined in detail. These results, in conjunction with the radar/sonar equation, are employed to ascertain the feasibility of a monostatic Doppler current velocity measuring system. It is shown that a pulsed Doppler technique should permit the measurement of local current velocities in a relatively small volume of water through the determination of frequency shifts between the incident and scattered acoustic radiation. As an example, at a frequency of 300 kHz for 100 W transmitted peak power, reasonably strong scattering (scattering cross section per unit volume per unit solid angled\\sigma/d\\Omega = 10^{-13} cm^{-1}), and a pulse length resolution of 3 m it should be possible to detect returns from a range of 100 m with a 14 dB signal-to-noise ratio. In the calculations presented, both the ambient noise due to thermal agitation and transmission losses caused by absorption are taken into account."
"HF radio waves backscattered from the ocean surface can be used to remotely measure ocean surface currents. Measurements of the range-Doppler spectrum of these signals yields the wavelength and frequency of the scattering ocean waves, and thus their phase velocity.This velocity is subtracted from the velocity the wave would have in still water, and the difference is a measure of the average (over depth) of the surface current.To test these ideas, we measured currents using a conventional and the HF technique, and found reasonable agreement between the two measurements."
"An optical radar for detecting targets in natural waters was built and tested in the Gulf of Mexico. The transmitter consists of a Q-switched neodymium-glass laser, with output amplified and doubled in KDP to 0.53 micrometer wavelength. The receiver incorporates a novel optical spatial filter to reduce the dynamic range required of the photodetector to a reasonable value. Detection of targets to a depth of 84 feet was achieved with a considerable sensitivity margin. The sensitivity of the radar is highly dependent on the optical attenuation coefficient. In general, measured returns fell between the values predicted on the basis of monopath and multipath attenuation. By means of simple physical arguments a radar equation for the system was derived. To validate this theoretical model, measurements of optical attenuation and of water surface behavior were also instrumented, and some of these results are given. Volumetric backscatter was measurable over the entire depth range; such radars should therefore be useful for monitoring natural water quality. Airborne bottom-profiling is another application."
"An active sonar array processor is concerned with the detection of a signal echo reflected from a target in the presence of reverberation. The present paper derives conditions on signal, reverberation and array parameters under which the optimum (likelihood ratio) detector can be factored into spatial and temporal operations. Also, a brief attempt is made at signal design under the criterion of factorability. We also study the relation of factorability to the maximum likelihood estimates of target range and bearing."
"A study of temporal variability in oceanic sound velocity structure was undertaken in order to determine its effect on the propagation of acoustic waves to the first convergence zone. A statistical analysis was performed using sound velocity profiles measured in 3 different geographic locations. The results give some basis for predicting temporal variations in range to the first convergence zone caustic for short term operations in a relatively fixed location."
"A recursive algorithm for estimating the intensity parameter of a non-stationary filtered Poisson process is presented. The algorithm, which is tested on simulated acoustic volume reverberation, adjusts the scatterer density until the number of peaks in a segment of simulated reverberation approaches the number of peaks in a corresponding segment of measured reverberation. Extensions of the algorithm may be useful for assessment of marine resources or for the extraction of process intensity estimates for simulation of radar or sonar scattering."
"A system designed to give maximum flexibility and portability has been developed to collect wave, current, and other physical data within the dynamic environment from the surf zone to the edge of the shelf. The system consists of a radio-linked shore station housed in a mobile van and as many as six shelf stations mounted in bottom reference spars. Deployment of a shelf station can be accomplished using a small boat with minimum diver assistance. This ease of deployment coupled with the mobility of the receiving shore station allows field studies to be conducted at remote coastal sights. Each of the shelf stations is designed to accommodate as many as fifteen sensors. All simultaneous sensor outputs are digitized and transmitted, using pulse code modulation (PCM), to the mobile shore station, where the received signals are processed and selected for recording on strip charts or digital magnetic tapes for computer analysis. Very high sampling rates and an IRIG time code system are used to insure precise time correlation between all data channels, including those from separate shelf stations. A single shelf station would transmit data from an array of wave sensors, thus providing continuous wave climate including the two dimensional wave spectra. Some different combinations of shelf station ensembles are shown."
"Two types of data loggers, developed from generally off shelf components, are described. The loggers use the same recording system, a digital cassette recorder with 4 track, 800 bpi capability. Digital operation with COS-MOS electronics makes for low power, essential in many geophysical studies. The first type of logger is used for long term averages. Pre-amplifiers interface various sensors to low frequency VCO's which drive ripple counters. The counters are periodically written to tape and cleared for a new count. The unit is flexible in that channels may easily be added, and the sample period, VCO frequencies, and word size are easily adjusted. The second type of recorder produces a burst of data at selected times as is desirable for ocean wave studies. A control system allows one to accurately set start, stop, and sampling times. Both period and cycle counting sampling can be employed depending on the measurement accuracy desired. The units are used in the Coastal Upwelling Experiments and a brief statement of performance is given."
"A ship mounted radar was developed to measure the wave heights from a moving ship. The radar antenna beam is pointed toward the unperturbed ocean surface from the forward superstructure of the ship. The distance changes due to the ocean waves and ship's motions are tracked by a closed loop digital range tracker and the range measurements are recorded. Ship's forward speed, roll, pitch, and heave are independently sensed so that their effect can be subtracted from the total radar range measurement to obtain the true wave heights."
"Cranes, placed on board ships, experience dynamic loadings which generally do not exist for land based cranes. Equations of motion are derived for a simple model of a mass suspended by cable from a crane attached to a ship which has arbitrary prescribed motion. The response of the mass is determined, through numerical integration of the differential equations of motion, for a typical ship motion and for a range of cable lengths and rates of change of cable length. Large response angles of oscillation are seen to develop for certain critical lengths of cable. Reduction of response motion appears to be made possible through careful control of mass deployment or retrieval velocities."
"The Acoustic Transponder and Acoustic Switch are remotely actuated equipments used by swimmers for navigation and remote control. Both equipments are actuated by a Portable Acoustic Interrogator which uses an acoustic code of eight serial 50 millisecond code tone bursts with each followed by 50 millisecond blanking tone bursts. The code tone bursts are combinations of two code frequencies and are selected to make eight total codes. Six codes are used to actuate Acoustic Transponders, and two are used for setting and resetting Acoustic Switches. The codes are received by hard limiting constant false alarm type circuits and decoded with digital logic circuits using codes stored in a read-only memory. Tests completed in April 1973 showed the equipment to work nearly 100 percent of the time in enclosed or open waters when not limited by measured sound velocity gradients. Also, the equipment has had no false actuations even in areas of high background noise."
"This paper describes a technique for predicting the scattering strengths of biological scatterers in the ocean. An attempt was made to predict the seasonal variations in the biomass and volume reverberation (at various frequencies) in the Arctic. A dynamic biological population production model has been constructed which converts environmental input parameters into a prediction of the density and size distributions of the biological population as a function of space and time. This output is then converted to a prediction of the volume scattering strength by use of theoretical and empirical relationships between organism size and distribution and acoustic scattering phenomena. We have used a simple model to describe the intertrophic population dynamics of the biological scatterers. The model simulates relationships between the nutrient concentration and the population density of the various organisms. The feasibility of monitoring the biomass by acoustic techniques coupled with computer simulation is also discussed."
"The design and application of a pivoted-vane, current meter are described. The purpose of the meter is to measure turbulence parameters in natural waters, such as estuaries or the ocean. The self-aligning instrument can be cable suspended and is capable of simultaneously measuring horizontal and vertical components of velocity and their turbulent fluctuations. A variable frequency oscillator using a pendulum potentiometer as the sensing device provides a signal specifying the angular deviation of the velocity vector from horizontal. An axial, ducted impeller indicates the speed of the flow in the direction of the mean current. Contemporary integrated circuits and solid state components are used in the electronic circuit design to provide digital output signals. Coaxial cables, 150m in length, transmit the data from a remote collection area to a control point where the data storage and read out systems are located."
"The performance evaluation of several solid-state, no-moving-parts water current meters of different manufacture is reported by the National Oceanographic Instrumentation Center. These tests have uncovered both design deficiencies and operational problems with the instruments. The design of the instruments studied include electromagnetic, vortex-shedding, and acoustic doppler types. In the case of the electromagnetic type, it was found that the principal problems related to the hydrodynamic properties of the transducers and those associated with the electronics and manufacturing. The vortex shedding meter was found to have a lower accuracy, relatively high threshold, and a need for precise alignment to water flow. The greatest problem associated with the doppler meters is reported to be quality of reflected signal. The Center intends to continue its study of no-moving-parts water current meters including those which utilize acoustic and drag force techniques."
"Engineering of the storage battery into an integrated oceanographic power system has been successfully accomplished. This is evidenced by the scores of systems in operation below the seas today. This accomplishment was made possible by the development of a sophisticated pressure compensation system and applying it to existing electrochemical couples. Comprehensive studies of lead-acid and silver zinc cell operating characteristics at temperatures as low as30\\degF and pressures up to 10,000 psi have led to the use of these batteries in systems ranging from small underwater vehicles to mobile sea floor equipment to large stationary habitats. From laboratory evaluations, it was determined that the advantageous effect of elevated pressures on the performance of lead-acid batteries is offset by the deleterious effect of cold temperature. The net effect of these same environs on the silver zinc cell is a decrease of 10% in discharge performance."
"This paper summarizes the results of an investigation into the critical problems of developing a practical focussed or lens-type ultrasonic image converter for small submersibles capable of operating to 20,000-foot depths. The problems of specular reflections, lens depth of field, and acoustic absorption are described. Trade offs between information rate, complexity, and imaging performance are discussed. A simple, partially filled rotating array converter is proposed as the most cost effective approach for an operational system using current technology. Results from high-pressure tests of experimental array elements are presented."
"Until recently, the limiting parameter in the design of hyperbaric life support systems has been the method of oxygen partial pressure control. This paper describes in detail a control system incorporating a new oxygen sensor especially designed for prolonged exposure to high pressures followed by rapid decompression. The electronics control system incorporates triple redundant oxygen level measurement, output limiting, and system disabling in the event of malfunction. In addition, a sampled data control system for controlling oxygen levels in small volumes, such as a closed cycle diver rebreather, is discussed."
"The partitioned and modified chirp Z-transform (PAM-CZT) is a signal processing technique for computing the Z-transform of a sequence at equally spaced samples on a sector of the unit circle in the Z-plane. Unlike the computationally cumbersome classical technique (4), the PAM-CZT utilizes the fast Fourier transform (FFT) that allows real time implementation with state of the art minicomputers. Another advantage of the PAM-CZT is its partitioning capability; long sequences can be processed in short-time-ordered sequences, thereby providing spectral analysis to any frequency resolution by allowing large time records. This signal processing technique will aid in the analysis of acoustically propagated noises in the ocean. Classical experiments utilize a monochromatic probe set at different frequencies for each of several orthogonal time records. However, the quasi-stationarity of the ocean inhibits reaching conclusions as to the frequency dependence of the surface reradiated spectrum' because the measurements are corrupted by the slowly varying characteristics of the ocean. An alternative approach is to simultaneously probe the ocean surface with several sinusoids and perform a PAM-CZT analysis of the results."
"A fifteen channel hardwire, multiplexed physiologic monitoring system for use on divers in all environments is described. Parameters include ECG, respiratory gas flow, temperatures, work output and ambient pressure. The system may be used in a dual diver mode. The data may be analyzed on a computer based data acquisition system. A specially designed ergometer is described. The data will be useful in assessing man's capabilities and limitations in the sea. Preliminary results indicate that the system described here is useful for monitoring thermal stress on divers as well as general physiologic response to imposed work loads."
"Present status of voice communication in the deep and/or saturation diving situation is unsatisfactory. The use of helium solves physiological problems, but it creates the problem of \"helium-speech,\" the degradation of speech intelligibility. A number of studies on the helium distortions have been reported, and yet the systematic observation and analysis of them have not been carried out. The helium-speech is recorded under the controlled condition. Various aspects of the analysis and observation are made to clarify the nature of helium-speech and to provide the useful data for designing the helium-speech unscrambler. Two types of unscramblers are developed. Analysis-Synthesis type is an extended version of the conventional formant vocoder and is computer-simulated to study various schemes. After a simulation of the Segmentation, Partial-Rejection and Expansion (SPREX) type to get the optimum condition, a digital hard-ware of the SPREX is built."
"Quantitative assessment of decompression-induced emboli in the blood flow may provide important information relating to physiological changes associated with decompression. A CW transmitter-receiver unit and a chest-mounted transducer probe have been developed for non-invasive ultrasonic monitoring of pulmonary blood flow using Doppler shift techniques. Preliminary spectral analysis of signals obtained during simulated dives in a hyperbaric test facility indicates that the spectrum of abnormal emboli signals is significantly different from that of normal blood flow. A preliminary theory explaining the observed spectra is offered."
"The NOAA Data Buoy Office (NDBO) has, since October 1972, deployed a number of Oceanographic and Meteorological (O&M) data buoys in various gulf and ocean regions to provide, essentially, synoptic data for the National Weather Service and for scientific service communities. The overall framework by which O&M reporting is accomplished, is governed by international agreements, notably, the World Administration Radio Conference (WARC) 1967 and related conferences thereto. However, within the WARC framework designated for oceanographic data transmission, several different approaches have been taken with regard to functional implementation and operation. This paper will present the generalized WARC operating framework, the various approaches regarding frequency channeling, design, performance and operation of the data acquisition function for four types of buoys. Initial results for each buoy type will also be presented. Finally, this paper will broach the plans for conversion to communication satellite operation for 1974 and beyond."
"Acoustic surveys of the spawning population of Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) in Port Susan, Washington have been conducted annually since 1969. Analog echo voltage and voltage-squared integrators were used in conjunction with 38-kHz echo sounders for the 1969 and 1970 surveys. In 1971 a digital echo integration system was developed and applied to the surveys in conjunction with a 105-kHz echo sounder. Surveys were expanded in 1972 to the areas adjacent to Port Susan to evaluate the importance of the spawning behavior and timing in the assessment of the stock size. Surveys in 1972 and 1973 used the digital system in conjunction with both 38-kHz and 105-kHz echo sounders. The acoustic surveys, supported by data from net catches, indicate considerable variation in the hake population during the five years."
"An instrument for measuring the conductivity (specific conductance) of seawater in situ is described. Basically the instrument consists of a three-terminal, platinum electrode flow-through cell which acts as the variable resistance in a Wien bridge oscillator. The oscillator section is well suited to drive the cell, since the ac signal amplitude is so small that polarization effects are minimized. The results of field and laboratory tests are given. Noise level and resolution are about 0.0005 mmho/cm. Short-term absolute accuracy is on the order of\\pm 0.01mmho/cm over a conductivity range of 26 to 36 mmho/cm. Data on long-term stability, although not known at this time, will become available with further testing and field use during the coming years. The instrument weighs 26 ounces in air and 12 ounces in water."
"Thermal insulation is one of the most critical components involved in life support in a large number of operations undersea. The degree to which thermal insulation is effective in blocking the flow of heat depends both upon its properties and also upon the environment. For example; the common closed cell wet-suit material compresses and loses efficiency as a function of pressure at depth. The factors involved in thermal protection of divers are very difficult to evaluate in theory or in the lab, thus a method of \"in situ\" measurement was developed. The method is based upon direct measurement of the heat flow through the thermal insulation by the use of thermoelectric heat flow transducers applied in series with the principal heat flow path. The temperature difference (\\Delta t) between the outer surface of the insulating layer and the skin is also determined and the thermal resistance is then computed as the ratio of\\Delta t/heat flow. Typical resistance units, readily convertible to \"Clo\", are\\degC \\times watt^{-1} \\times x meter^{-2}. The feasibility of the method was tested at moderate depths in Catalina waters, with wetsuited divers, using open circuit SCUBA and \"hooka\" breathing systems. The instruments proved reliable. The thermal resistance, an indication of the functional quality of the wet suits, was measured for several suit configurations. Regional differences within a single suit as well as surface-averaged data for the whole suit were obtained. These data are reported as thermal resistance given as a function of location on the suit. The method would be equally applicable to the walls of habitats, or personnel transfer capsules, heated or passively insulated. The development of better thermal barriers for personnel protection undersea should be aided by this direct measurement method."
"The Ocean Space Robot system described here was planned by MITI in April 1971 and have been under development at the Japan Society for The Promotion of Machine Industry. The primary objective of this project is to develop an ocean space measuring system comprised mainly of unmanned vehicles and mooring buoys. This system can measure and analyse multiple parameters in an ocean area by obtaining space distributions and time variations of the parameters in this area. The vehicle is capable of traveling under water at moderate speeds for long distances along the pre-selected trajectory while making measurements and recording them internally. When the vehicle merges from water, the data are telemetered to the land base and stored in the computer there. The role of the mooring buoy is to survey time variations of ocean parameters at its location. Furthermore, the mooring buoy acts to relay between the land base and each vehicle."
"The device for gathering fish schools by using underwater acoustical equipment was conceived on the idea that if fish schools could be lured to a location and driven into a fish net by emitting the effective sound, fishing efficiency could be increased. The underwater sound projector of a flat frequency response from 150Hz up to 4,500Hz was produced, corresponding to acoustic features of fish. Yellowtail responded to their swimming and bait eating sound of 5-17dB re 1 ubar. The catch of squid was definitely more for the periods of emitting effective sound than for the periods of not emitting sound. Mackerel and jack mackerel responded to its swimming and bait eating sound of higher than 22dB and ascended. In the stationary net fishing, fish was lured by sound into the net and the big catch never got before was obtained."
 "A system of bottom-anchored upward-locking acoustic sensors is currently under joint development by the Fisheries Research Institute and the Applied Physics Laboratory, both of the University of Washington. The sensors are to be deployed in the Port Moller area of Bristol Bay to provide population data on the annual sockeye salmon run some 4 to 8 days prior to the entry of the fish into the various commercial fishery districts. This system is designed to augment the gill net test fishing currently carried out and to overcome many of the shortcomings of gill-netting such as size selectivity, variable efficiency and the inability to fish in rough weather. Sampling statistics indicate that ten such sensors in a randomized design will provide sufficient coverage. A mathematical formulation utilizing statistical decision theory and dynamic programming has been developed to characterize the optimum experimental design as well as the optimum fishery management policies. The need for near real time data over large distances suggested the use of a satellite as a data transmission link. This would permit the use of remote large-scale computing facilities in the processing of the population data."
"Of the several existing techniques for the passive acoustic reconstruction of underwater target-sensor geometries, the procedure based upon the Doppler shift phenomenon has received considerable attention. A fundamental requirement for the design of any Doppler tracking system or algorithm is a measure of the optimal performance that may be expected for a given set of operating conditions. This paper describes the development and application of such a set of performance bounds. In particular, a computer simulation was constructed from the linearized, noiseless, Doppler constraint equations. The performance bounds were inferred from a study of the output of the model in response to errors in the input measurements. Of particular interest was the role played by the total geometry matrix in controlling system response to input errors. The format of the performance bound was a functional relationship which expresses the frequency and target location measurement accuracies required for specific target parameter (i.e., location and velocity) accuracies. The Doppler polar profile was introduced to add physical insight to the tracking process, and to cast the performance bounds into an operationally useable format."
"Behaviors of laser beams propagating through the sea water were measured, which are a beam profile and a attenuation characteristic. The maximum distance detecting a laser beam was obtained by using a photon counter to 26.5 attenuation length. The propagation experiment was conducted at Sakaide Bay in Seto inland sea. A new towtype\\alphameter was constructed to measure a cluster of optical and oceanic parameters which are required on applying laser beams to the marine electronics."
"This paper outlines a systematic approach to fishery management. A model is presented that attempts to bring together many of the biological, economic, and political factors that must be considered in setting fishery policy. In addition to yield, the output of the model gives a number of factors that determine in part the political attractiveness of the arrangements under study. The use of the model is demonstrated with a simple study of national quota systems."
"Measurements of the acoustic volume scattering strength were made in the Marginal Ice Zone of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas in the summers of 1971 and 1972. During the 1971 cruise, the measurements were made from the USCGC NORTHWIND using a 105 kHz pulsed cw vertically directed sonar, and during the 1972 cruise the measurements were made from the USCGC STATEN ISLAND using the 105 kHz echo sounder as well as a 38 kHz echo sounder. Approximately 60 data files were recorded on magnetic tape in 1971, and 100 data files in 1972. Selective biological sampling was performed with vertical net hauls and horizontal trawls. The data indicate that the Marginal Ice Zone is an area of great biological activity-at least during the summer months. Volume scattering strengths as great as -42 dB were observed. Detailed examination of the magnetic tapes and the echograms reveals many distinct fish as well as numerous plankton layers at all depths."
"A free, acoustically tracked, neutrally buoyant float, with an open loop buoyancy control system actuated by command from the surface, has been developed as a dye pool tag for deep ocean diffusion experiments. An internal battery powered motor driven pump varies buoyancy by metering hydraulic fluid into or out of an external chamber separated from sea water by a flexible diaphragm. The vertical transient movement of the float submerged in a motionless ocean has been analyzed using normalized dimensionless parameters. This simple analysis does not strictly apply in highly stratified water where there is substantial interaction between the float and the surrounding fluid; however, the analysis can be used for the initial design of neutrally buoyant floats. A float at equilibrium depth, being less compressible than water, will not necessarily duplicate periodic vertical motions of the water mass in which it is embedded."
"The Arctic region is of significance to meteorological, military, mineral exploration, and transportation application. The development of an all weather system possessing the capability to classify Arctic ice in real-time is of potential benefit to these diverse interests. Analysis of airborne 2.25 cm radar measurements from the Beaufort Sea have established the feasibility of the all weather radar measurement and classification of Arctic sea ice. These investigations have demonstrated the grouping of these radar measurements according to ice age. An electronic radar signal processor/ice classification system has been developed using signal conditioning and linear discriminant classification techniques to provide real-time identification of sea ice by type. The processing of actual and simulated radar data by this prototype system has shown the applicability of the system design criteria in the real-time classification of Arctic sea ice."
"BOMIS consists of a winch and instrument package installed on the ocean floor and electronics equipment located ashore; these components are interconnected with underwater cables. An electric motor drives the winch, paying out cable to raise the buoyant instrument package to the desired operating depth. Multiple systems will be installed in each instrument package, permitting a variety of functions capable from one installation. All instrumentation signals are multiplexed into a single coaxial cable from the buoy to shore, and power to drive the winch is supplied on a separate three-phase power cable. Design goal is a maintenance-free life of 5 years for the winch and cables. The instrument package can be brought to the surface for calibration and refitment with new equipment as required."
"The annual run of sockeye salmon into Bristol Bay, Alaska, is the largest run of this species in the world, and is of vital economic importance to the state of Alaska. To optimize catch and escapement, fishery management personnel need accurate and timely fish population data, but the test fishing techniques currently employed have had limited success. To improve management data, a system of bottom-mounted, upward-looking acoustic sensors specifically designed to assess Bristol Bay salmon is currently under joint development by the Fisheries Research Institute and the Applied Physics Laboratory, both of the University of Washington. This paper describes that system."
"Short range acoustic transmission measurements were made in the summer of 1972 between two stations on a drifting ice floe in the marginal ice zone of the Chukchi Sea. The measurements were accomplished by transmitting short 60 kHz pulses from a transmitter placed at a fixed depth and then raising and lowering a receiving hydrophone 220 yd away at hourly intervals. At the same time, temperature profiles were measured at four stations on the ice floe and salinity profiles at one station. At the northern edge of the marginal ice the sound velocity profile was nearly constant, but within the zone a very irregular profile resulted from the intrusion of Pacific water. Analysis of the results of the study shows temperature layers of0.1\\degC that extend hundreds of yards and result in sound velocity variations which cause a considerable variation in acoustic transmissions at low angles (\\pm5dB). Such thermal structure, as well as larger, more persistent layers, are common in the marginal ice zone of the Chukchi Sea."
"Low-frequency, cylindrical hydrophones are compared for an application which required small elements capable of operation to a depth of 4,500 feet. Critical parameters are maximum ceramic diameter of 0.3 inch, minimum acoustic sensitivity of -110 dBV/microbar, and minimum free capacitance of 300 pF. Comparison of performances offered by a wide range of element designs narrows the field to these four candidates: radially-polarized, ceramic cylinders with 1) capped ends, air-filled core; 2) shielded ends,solid core; 3) metal-diaphragm ends, air-filled and kerosene-filled core; and 4) double-ended bilaminar, flexidisk elements filled with kerosene, silicone fluid, and transformer oil. Expressions from the classical literature are used to calculate acoustic sensitivities of the first two types, and new expressions are used for the second two types. Acoustic sensitivity curves are included for outside diameters ranging from 0.2 to 1.5 inches, and for the critical parameters listed above, it is concluded that all four candidate designs could potentially meet the stated requirements."
"To fulfill the need for environmental data required for the establishment of rational water quality standards, an integrated underwater environmental monitoring system has been designed and tested. This system consists of a vehicle that houses a number of electrochemical and electrophysical sensors and a recording system. The environmental parameters measured by the monitor are: depth, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, oxidation-reduction potential, sulfide ion activity and ambient light. The vehicle can be 1) towed behind a boat at different depths or at constant distance from the bottom or 2) operated by a diver. The entire monitor is self-contained and does not require any external power supply during operation. The data are recorded on 16 mm film in alphanumeric form. The computer-performed data reduction consists of 1) correcting each parameter value for electronic and sensor drift and for temperature, 2) transforming these values into more manageable units by means of calibration curves or definition formulae and 3) presenting the data in plotted form as a function of location for easy interpretation."
"General requirements for a Harbor Surveillance Radar system are described. A system that provides surveillance of marine traffic in the San Francisco harbor area is described and performance is discussed. The system provides capability for detecting small vessels in higher sea states and at longer ranges than is currently available. High resolution allows detection of marine traffic and fixed objects separated by minimum distances and also minimizes the effects of rain and sea clutter. Large 16-inch PPI displays are provided with zoom capability and electronic leading lines to permit operator viewing and interpretation of critical harbor areas. Functional redundance and autoalarm of system malfunction provide reliability and maintainability greater than that currently available."
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in acoustic techniques for estimating fish abundance. A lower bound on the variance of the abundance estimates is derived in this paper. The analysis assumes that the fish are Poisson-distributed in volume and that the estimate is obtained using independent samples from the received acoustic signal. It is shown that the variance of the estimate obtained from an echo counter satisfies the bound in low fish densities and that the variance of the estimate obtained from an echo integrator satisfies the bound in high fish densities."
"Measurements of sound velocity, temperature, and salinity were made in St. Andrew Bay, Florida. These measurements were made tostudy one-way sound transmission in shallow water. Three effects concerning the interaction of the environment with the sound velocity structure are described: first, the salinity structure in a bay may play a more important role than the temperature in determining the sound velocity gradients; second, the medium displayed a layered structure rather than being a heterogeneous mixture containing patches of differing sound velocity; and third, tidal currents seem to be responsible for either partially mixing thermal layers or vertically displacing the thermal gradients. Thus, in a shallow bay there are large fluctuations and changes in temperature and salinity resulting in correspondingly large changes in the sound velocity structure. The usually present salinity gradient adds to the complexity of the interaction between the seasonal temperature changes and tidal currents. Therefore, predicting sound velocity gradients in a shallow bay is generally more formidable than for the open sea."
"The utility of the physical optics approximation is explored for the computation of electromagnetic fields of dipole sources in the neighborhood of conducting bodies of diverse shape in a lossy environment such as the ocean. Excellent agreement with previous exact results is obtained for spheres down to one skin depth diameter with source-detector separation up to one skin depth. Only when the sphere size is reduced to one-tenth skin depth do errors in excess of three decibels begin to appear. Such comparisons have confirmed the accuracy of the method for application to non-spherical body shapes. The computer program allows investigation of the response for orthogonally oriented source and detection dipoles in the presence of smooth, curved, conducting bodies in a homogeneous lossy medium. Results are given for spheres, infinite cylinders, prolate spheroids and super-elliptic spheroids exposed to magnetic dipole sources."
"Modes, or eigenfunction solutions to the scalar wave equation, have been useful in understanding acoustic interference phenomena observed in shallow water. The premise that one can enhance modes compatible with propagation conditions to suit one's purpose is the basis for current investigation in shallow-water acoustic propagation at the Naval Underwater Systems Center. Mode Enhancement Techniques (METS) for transmission and reception of acoustic signals are described in this paper. Also described is the use of a vertical array of transducers, a novel experimental tool employed in developing METS. During reception, the individual signals can be weighted and summed to reject unwanted modes. During transmission, the signal amplitude and phase distribution over the array can be varied to manipulate and enhance particular modes. In addition,factors affecting systems performance, such as reverberation and ambient noise,are viewed in terms of mode rejection."
"The purpose of the present research is to demonstrate that sea state-as expressed via the waveheight directional spectrum-can be determined with a long-range sky-wave HF radar system by a proper interpretation of the higher-order signal-echo Doppler spectrum. Sea-echo spectra measured at many HF frequencies in an experimental surface-wave radar system agree with theoretical predictions to first and second order, indicating that gross initial estimates of the waveheight directional spectrum can be obtained quickly from inspection of the radar records. Those initial estimates-along with an understanding of the general behavior of the integrand-will permit the numerical inversion of an integral equation for second-order scatter to obtain a considerably more refined calculation of the waveheight directional spectrum. Such techniques should prove useful in a future operational system for the routine monitoring of sea conditions out to 1500 nmi from the U.S. coasts."
"In response to the increasing need for accurate and reliable water quality monitoring instrumentation, we have directed our research and development efforts toward the measurement of chemical and biologically related parameters in addition to the classical physical measurements of conductivity, temperature, and depth. The Model 513 Oceanographic salinity, temperature and depth instrument was used as the starting point for the addition of Dissolved Oxygen, pH, Turbidity, and Specific Ion sensors. The systems integration problems and sources of error in measuring these parameters is the main focus of this paper. Long term results for unattended dissolved oxygen measurements show an average error of 0.05 PPM over a 22 day test period without any recalibration. Long term errors for other parameters are less."
"Raytheon Company, in conjunction with the University of New Hampshire, is engaged in a multi-year study of the application of acoustics to the determination of marine soils physical and engineering properties. These investigations being conducted under SEAGRANT sponsorship are presently in their third year. Initial research efforts directed towards the parallel development of both a field theoretical model and extension of the more simplistic plane-wave model have lead to a preliminary design concept, instrumentation and computer aided analysis techniques for an operational remote acoustic sediment classification system. Current output is in the form of digital computer print out detailing the measured and calculated sediment properties. Field test results employing acoustic systems in classifying marine sediments; the correlations of physical sampling with precision measurements of compressional wave velocity and amplitude reflection coefficients are reported."
"If hybrid circuitry is to be used in the deep ocean, unprotected from the high pressure encountered there, the performance of the various components that make up the circuitry must be known. To determine this performance, both thick-film and thin-film hybrid circuitry was pressure tested. The first series of tests (up to 15 000 psig) were on thick-film and thin-film resistors and ceramic chip capacitors. The components were fabricated and mounted by using ordinary hybrid techniques and were then enclosed in a standard hybrid package. Prior to being pressure tested, the package was filled with an inert liquid. The results of these tests indicated that at 15 000 psig (1) thin-film resistors are very stable, having a\\Delta R(change in resistance) of -100 to -400 ppm, (2) thick-film resistors have\\DeltaR's of up to 43%, (3) ceramic chip capacitors (both NPO and non-NPO), glass capacitors, and solid tantalum capacitors have\\DeltaC's of less than\\pm 5%, and (4) Zener diodes have\\DeltaV's of less than 0.3%."
"Among the performance indices used in the processing of acoustic array signals are those that can be expressed as a ratio of quadratic forms in the beamformer weights. Popular indices in this class include directivity, array gain, efficiency factor, and supergain ratio. This paper presents a technique for optimizing a quadratic-form-ratio performance index over the beamformer weights subject to generally nonzero constraints on the value of the array power pattern in multiple directions. Previous related results include performance optimization with no constraints, with specified pattern nulls, and with constraints on the complex-valued beam pattern. When an array designer is interested just in the beam pattern magnitude, the additional specification of pattern phase required by these techniques generally penalizes the optimization. Only magnitude (power pattern) constraints are imposed in this paper. The optimum weights are shown to satisfy a characteristic equation with quadratic constraints that is related to a more familiar optimization problem for which solution methods exist. Applications include performance maximization with fixed main-lobe beamwidth and/or sidelobe values. Examples are given for a circular array."
 "Summary form only given. This paper reviews several applications of underwater sound to ship positioning and navigation. Applicable to the case are range-range systems, range hyperbolic systems and the special case of both the navigation along the congregate axis of the hyperbola. The case for harbor and coastal approach is examined and sonic methods for making a foul weather land fall is explained. Acoustic systems of the type described when employed in large vessels experience only a small degradation of signal to noise ratio as a result of bad weather. For operation within harbors, sonic methods of harbor marking and of collision avoidance are discussed."
 "The profilometer developed for attachment to sediment corers to obtain an in situ sound speed profile during coring operations, which was described at Ocean 72, has been refined and used to collect additional data. The refinements, including an automatic gain control, are discussed. Sound speed data and core analyses demonstrating the measurement capabilities and usefulness of the profilometer are presented."
"Analysis is made of a \"multiplicative\" receiving array model which is known to have about one-half the beamwidth of the \"additive\" or conventional (square-law) array with the same number of elements. The probability density functions for the filter outputs of array models are shown for monochromatic, planewave signals in the presence of narrowband Gaussian noise, for broadside arrays with equal spacing and uniform gains. The number of elements, SNR, source bearing, and interelement noise correlation are treated as parameters of the distribution, and their influences are displayed graphically. Based on these probability density functions for the square-law and the multiplicative array processors, we then examine their performances as signal detectors and as bearing estimators."
"The ACOUSTIPULSE is a new geophysical system for shallow penetration subbottom profiling. The acoustic pulse is generated electromechanically and is essentially a single cycle pulse. This single cycle pulse provides a higher degree of geophysical resolution than has been heretofore obtainable. One of the lease blocks in the December 1972 Offshore Louisiana Federal lease sale was studied using the ACOUSTIPULSE system. The study was oriented toward an investigation of the geologic hazards affecting the placement of offshore drilling platforms. Three types of geologic hazards were found. These were a buried river channel, shallow faults, and gas seep areas. The ACOUSTIPULSE system represents an important advance in offshore geologic engineering studies."
"Array configurations having irregular instead of periodic interelernent spacing have been discovered to have many useful properties. \"Random Arrays\", whose element position coordinates, and therefore array properties such as sidelobe level, SNR gains and directivity index, are random variables, have proven to be a useful tool for the design of irregularly spaced arrays when the stochastic transformation from position coordinates to array performance indices is made. A new concept of array deployment is presented whose performance is explicitly related to the ensemble properties of a random array, as opposed to a specific configuration. General effects of array parameters on performance indices are presented for the specific case of a planar array aimed in the array plane. These effects are illustrated with examples."
"In recent years the Kalman filter has been utilized extensively for passive target motion analysis (TMA). Unfortunately, in these applications divergence is a common problem. Available methods for eliminating divergence ultimately involve increasing filter sensitivity by discounting the influence of past data. However, this procedure makes the filter more susceptible to random errors; therefore to avoid unnecessarily sacrificing noise performance, adaptive control is required. In this paper the Kalman filter equations are derived and the associated data measurement residuals are examined to determine their suitability for providing adaptive control. An important relationship between the system performance index and the data residuals is established. By exploiting this relationship, pertinent statistical properties of the performance index are deduced and are subsequently utilized as a basis for formulating practical adaptive control criteria. A simulated example is presented to demonstrate divergence (e. g., tracking of a maneuvering target) and significant improvement in performance is noted when adaptive control is appended."
"In this paper a new technique is proposed for dealing with the transponder calibration problem. The method presented determines the relative location of transponders in a three-dimensional array of transponders fixed relative to one another. The method simultaneously yields the loci of a roving interrogator (ship) relative to each of the transponders in the array. System operation is dependent upon a sequential interrogation of the array to produce relative range measurements between each transponder of the array and the roving interrogator. The method yields closed-form solutions for all transponder coordinates and all interrogator coordinates. No prior knowledge is required in terms of a predetermined interrogator path and all results are exact in as much as the range measurements used are exact. Techniques are indicated for determining the sensitivities of both transponder coordinates and interrogator coordinates to range measurement variations. Effect of interrogator path and transponder geometry on results is discussed and the concept of critical, or singular, geometries, which produce poorly-conditioned solutions, is introduced."
"Acoustic calibration of a large-aperture, low-frequency sonar array presented several problems not normally encountered in conventional sonar array calibration:\\bulletFar-field measurements were not possible due to sound field refraction from warm water near the surface.\\bulletPulse separation of surface reflections couldn't be used due to the free-time/pulse-length ratio.\\bulletRotator shaft indexing for beam patterns was not feasible due to barge motion and extreme hydrophone separation. A calibration system was designed and built which utilized quasi-far-field measurements with a directional' transducer and an auxiliary acoustic angular position reference system. The system was installed and used to obtain transmit and receive beam pattern and response data with calibration accuracy close to conventional techniques."
"The steps which a sonar operator goes through in finally calling \"target\" while using a trainable beam passive sonar in the aural mode are described. Three distinct processes are identified: (a) single observation, (b) multiple sequential observation, and (c) multiple sweep. Using these concepts and data from two-alternative forced-choice psychoacoustic experiments, one can calculate a transition curve for realistic sonar operator performance. These calculations are compared with transition curves obtained from sonar performances on a more realistic sonar mock-up. The significance of the paper is in the detailed description of the aural process and in the method for calculating aural detection performance."
"The Navy faces a world environment that is changing at a high rate. Opponent seapower is growing stronger daily. Future funding for the Navy will be level at best and will probably decline. Our task is to guarantee free use of the seas (20 \\times 10^{6} n.mi.^{2}for ourselves, our allies and neutrals, despite these factors. We can accomplish this task providing we: (i) guarantee the invulnerability of our FBM submarine second-strike capability, (2) apply the concepts of deterrence to major confrontations at sea, (3) replace our aging Naval surface ships with larger numbers of smaller high-performance ships, and (4) accept that the world situation ard funds will not allow us to deny use of the seas to our opponents except under very limited and clearly delineated circumstances. Our sonar program will of necessity focus on high-potential systems relative to the foregoing. Passive detection of surface ships and high-speed submarines should be given priority, since low-speed submarines will become virtually undetectable."
"A method is presented for determining by acoustical means the relative locations of an array of acoustic transponders (or hydrophonesr beacons) located at fixed but unknown positions in the ocean. The method does not depend on accurate positioning of the survey ship. Hence, it is suitable for open ocean applications, far from shore based navigation aid systems. The technique allows data to be sequentially processed as it is collected, and the \"Least Square\" computing algorithm is extremely simple and easily programmable on a minicomputer. Hence, the method is considered a real time technique. A Monte Carlo computer simulation is used to determine the effects of different error sources, the accuracy of the method, and the best path for the survey ship to travel."
"Discussed and analyzed is a marine navigation system in which a high performance system, the Ships Inertial Navigation System (SINS), is monitored by an even more accurate system now under development, the Electrostatically Supported Gyro Navigator (ESGN). An advantage of this monitor configuration is a potentially substantial improvement in navigational accuracy, while imposing a minimal change to the existing system. General equations for performing a covariance error analysis of the SINS, ESGN, and ESG Monitor/SINS systems are described. Results are presented which draw relative accuracy comparisons between these systems."
"A combination of Raydist \"T\" and WANG Programmable Calculator Systems provides a capability for local precise navigation over large areas of up to 10,000 square miles. Daytime positioning accuracy of 10 yards is usual for an unlimited number of users. With the WANG, capability for system self-survey, generation of hyperbolic charts to any scale, plotting of actual tracks in x - y coordinates, and pre-plotting of parallel tracks is available. Three or four separate sites are needed for four transmitters powered by thermoelectric generators. Stations may be placed aboard anchored ships or buoys. Surveys, area searches, and channel clearance operations in coastal regions would find the system useful. This capability was developed by the Navy for its helicopter-equipped mobile Mine Countermeasures Forces using off-the-shelf commercially available and proven equipments to meet existing requirements."
"The feasibility of automated analysis using a Californium-252 neutron source has been studied. Both prompt gamma and decay gamma analysis are considered. sensitivities are tabulated for 25 elements in sea water. System parameters affecting sensitivity are presented for extrapolation toother designs. The effect of sampling frequency and desired sensitivity on automatic sample handling, counting and data processing is discussed. We conclude that a few elements can be analyzed directly from sea water, but most will require a preliminary chemical separation-concentration step. Rapid means of performing this operation are shown."
"A design procedure is presented for an underwater acoustic source that utilizes the medium's nonlinearity to generate energy at the difference frequency of the high level, or primary, frequencies. Several designs are presented and the results compared with experimental data. One of these experimental systems develops source levels as high as 220 dB//1\\muPam at a difference frequency of 14 kHz. The peak envelope power input to the projector is 20 kW for this system. Several attractive applications are described and verified by field measurements. These applications include echo ranging and bottom, subbottom, and deep scattering layer profiling."
"In an Acoustic Transponder Navigation System the vehicle position is determined in relation to the transponders by the use of ranges to the transponders and the distances between the transponders. The vehicle position determined is usually inaccurate due to the timing error and the inaccuracy of the sound velocity assumed in obtaining the range data. This paper develops computational algorithms for the optimal estimation of the vehicle position with given erroneous range data. The development begins with the formulation of a least-squares error criterion. Computational algorithms are then developed to best estimate the vehicle position by minimizing the least-squares error criterion. For the moving vehicles, optimal filtering algorithms are developed which sequentially update the vehicle position based on the knowledge of the vehicle dynamics and the range measurements. Computational results for one illustrative example in the application of the optimal filtering algorithms are presented."
"This study deals with the numerical analysis of the sonar doppler return spectra from the ocean surface. It is assumed that signal is backscattered from the small scale roughness superimposed upon the long crest waves of the ocean. Helmholtz integral approach is used for the plane wave case and Kirchhoff's approximations are employed. A carrier frequency of 50 kilohertz is used. For each surface roughness and fixed azimuth angle of20\\deg, variations in the shape and -3 dB bandwidth of the spectra are studied for incident angles of20\\deg, 30\\deg, 45\\deg, and60\\degIt is found that bandwidth parameterF_{D}varies exponentially with the angle of incident. Also,F_{D}varies linearly with the roughness parameter\\sigma_{xy}. The results are plotted and are believed to provide a useful information to the system designer."
"Simultaneous measurements with two moored current meter arrays and numerous drogues were made at an open ocean site three miles off the New Jersey coast. One current meter array had two ducted propeller sensors and the other two Savonius rotor sensors. The drogues and one each of the two current sensor-types were set six or seven meters above the bottom in twelve meters of water, while the other sensors were one meter above the bottom. Repeated sets of simultaneous measurements were made over a period of one month during the winter through a variety of sea and weather conditions. Correlations among the three methods of current measurements are presented. The degree of agreement between the field observations and both theoretical models and tank tests is also presented. Excessively high velocity measurements obtained using the Savonius rotor are shown to be principally due to rectification of orbital wave motion. The origin of the higher apparent velocities obtained using the ducted rotor is less certain. More definitive results will come from a subsequent investigation in which wave measurements have been made simultaneously. Observations concerning current measurements in the shallow open ocean are discussed."
"In this paper a world-wide applicable technique for recovering vertical deflections at sea using the astrogeodetic technique has been developed. It involves using the difference between the astronomic source, the Integrated Inertial System and Star Tracker, and the geodetic source, the NAVSAT as basic measurements. Then a spatial interpolation technique is applied to the spatially dispersed basic measurements to estimate vertical deflections everywhere in the area. Optimal Kalman smoothing involving star tracker damping and EM Log damping is applied to improve estimation capability for post test time applications. The technique was evaluated theoretically and empirically in an at-sea test performed on the U. S. Vanguard which contained all the required navigation devices."
"Fjords are to a considerable degree different from coastal plain estuaries in that the variations of chemical and physical parameters in the vertical direction are much more important. In order to properly evaluate or predict the environmental quality, including the biological and chemical aspects, requires a thorough knowledge and understanding of the dynamic physical situation. The finite element method can be used to provide the basis for determining the hydrodynamic parameters as well as for considering the transport of chemical substances. Thus, a mathematical simulation can be used for simulating water quality in a fjord under dynamic situations."

"An acostic navigation technique for the accurate positioning of surface ships, submerged devices and undersea transponders, is described. An iterative solution of an over-determinant set of equations is employed to fully utilize all available data for precise position determination including the depth coordinant of a submerged device. This technique greatly reduces the amount of ship time required to survey the transponder array. A mathmatical development of this technique is presented including a discussion of the proper mean sound velocity. Computer simulated operation used for technique evaluation and for parameter optimization is discussed along with limitations and restaints. This technique has been implemented using off-the-shelf acoustic navigation equipment and a minicomputer. At sea operation and results will be given at the oral presentation."
"Underwater transducers differ from loudspeakers in that they generally present a highly reactive load impedance, and may be subject to arcing. Conventional Hi-Fi amplifiers are not effective in driving reactive loads and do not afford the necessary protection. This paper discusses Class S, Class D, and Linear power amplifiers giving the features and limitations of each. Transient ringing with voltage and current sources is discussed. The simultaneous transmission of two or more frequencies or of noise requires substantial derating of an amplifier. Several special cases and their applications are discussed."
"Sonar system performance is governed by the effects of the ocean medium, the target, and the sonar equipment. This relationship is expressed in the terms of the sonar equation. The term of particular interest to acoustic modeling is the received signal level. Recent advances in ray theory and the analysis of measurements from several carefully planned and executed experiments have permitted certain properties of the wave field to be described within the context of ray acoustics. The result is the synthesis of a more unified approach drawing from the strengths of both disciplines and yielding an extremely powerful transmission-loss model. This paper describes this unified result which has been incorporated in Navy Standard models for the prediction of acoustic propagation loss."
"Low frequency responses of both spherical and cylindrical pressure gradient hydrophones with different sizes are analyzed under the assumption that the adjacent turbulent pressure fluctuations are a substantial contributor to the acoustic ambient-noise level for low frequencies. This study demonstrates the predicted equivalent sound pressure level at low frequencies can be reduced by changing the shape and/or the size of the pressure gradient hydrophone. The equivalent sound pressure levels of both spherical and cylindrical shapes of the same diameter at very low frequencies (0.01Hz to 0.5Hz) are the same. As the frequencies increase the equivalent sound pressure level of the spherical hydrophone decreases faster than that of the cylindrical one."
"The Naval Torpedo Station is researching means of scoring ordnance impacts using hydroacoustics. HISS is a system of bottom-mounted hydrophones, detectors, and computer designed to read the location of impacts from the associated acoustic transients. A range of this type is being proposed for installation in Puget Sound. Advantages of this method include remote readout, simplified operation, relative immunity to damage, and good data accuracy. The HISS concept is similar to existing 3-D tracking ranges (hyperbolic type), but is designed for the special purpose of impact location and uses off-the-shelf hardware to keep costs down."
"The AIDJEX Acoustic Bottom Reference System was built by InterOcean for precise tracking of ice station movement. It was operated for two months at the AIDJEX camp approximately 300 miles north of Pt. Barrow, Alaska in the spring of 1972. The system proved capable of determining position with an error of 5 to 10 meters RMS at distances to 18 km and water depth of 3800 meters. An array of 6 acoustic transducers is used to interrogate a bottom transponder. The acoustic travel times are fed to a digital computer which calculates position in real time. The system automatically computes the position of the array elements before each transponder interrogation. The field results include observations of hydrophone movement, and some notes on acoustic propagation in the deep Arctic Ocean under the ice."
"Acoustic data were collected in an attempt to determine the feasibility of through-ice tracking. Signals received at the upper surface of the ice were compared with the in-water acoustic pulses and changes in the pulse character were examined to assess the nature and extent of ice-caused perturbations. The results were then compared with a theory relating acoustic propagation at the water-ice interface to aspect angles."
"One of the objectives of the AIDJEX Spring 1972 Pilot Study was to develop an improved ability to measure the motions of sea ice in the central Arctic Ocean. An integrated system is described in which the basic measurements of position are acquired by the Navy Navigation Satellite System and a specially designed hydroacoustic tracking system. Celestial observations of ice floe azimuth give the system additional redundancy. These measurements are then related to ice velocities and accelerations by a series of time difference equations. Kalman filtering techniques are used in the data processing scheme. The power of this system was indicated by simulation runs and later confirmed by analysis of the field data. It appears that such a system can resolve the full spectrum of ice motions."
"A prototype tide gauge having an accuracy of\\pm0.5% of the tidal range and a resolution of\\pm0.1% suitable for unattended use over one year is described. It is based on an Aanderaa data logger and a differential pressure transducer installed together on the sea bed; tidal data is recorded internally, digitally at half hour intervals. A cable containing electrical conductors and a kerosene-filled hose rises to the shore allowing air pressure to be sampled, calibration to be checked, and telemetering/ transponding equipment to be attached. The instrument has been in limited commercial production; the first unit was installed at 801/2\\degN. during August, 1972."
"Marine Chemistry research was conducted in the summer of 1971 and 1972 in the Greenland Sea and in December of 1972 in the Ross Sea. Techniques used to determine trace gases (carbon monoxide, Freon-11, methane) and mercury in sea water, sea ice and snow, and in the polar atmosphere are discussed. Methods for studying polar marine aerosols are outlined and the use of satellite imagery for the construction of air mass trajectories near the Antarctic continent is described.Results of the investigations are included."
"To assure submarine coaxial cable system reliability in shallow water areas, an original ocean microwave communication system featuring a large floating ocean station (135m length, 100m draft)has been developed. This floating station is a cylindrical, vertical buoy moored to the bottom of a continental shelf and operates as a jointing point between the deep sea submarine cable system and the ocean microwave radio system. This paper discusses specific problems and solutions pertinent to establishing this 23,000 channel-capacity communication system, such as smaller sized antennas and radio equipments, new modified monopulse tracking system and high speed space diversity system. An ocean test using the first model of the floating station is planned for this summer."
"An easily deployable oceanographic sensor system consisting of a free-floating recording buoy and a tethered sensor suspension arrangement is described. An analysis of the dynamic response of the system to surface wave excitation is presented. Design optimization criteria that ensure minimal sensor motion are established."
"Presents the introductory welcome message from the conference proceedings. May include the conference officers' congratulations to all involved with the conference event and publication of the proceedings record."
"A single-point, taut-line mooring suspended by a submerged spherical buoy, of the type used to support oceanographic instrumentation, is investigated. The forcing function is composed of a steady-state horizontal current and a surface wave approximated by first order (Airy) theory. Buoy system nonlinearities are manifested by profile drag effects proportional to the square of the velocity and by the nonlinear elastic properties of the synthetic cable. An explicit numerical solution technique using a digital computer was made to obtain cable tension and shape, and buoy motion. The technique was applied to the response analyses of a U.S. Navy bottom-moored instrument system (BOMIS)."
"Presents the back cover of this proceedings volume."
"Numerical modeling techniques for a single-point moored oceanographic buoy system are described. These techniques are now in use to analyze the requirements for buoy/mooring systems. The differential equations of the line motion can be solved either with the method of characteristics or with a linearized perturbation theory. Buoy dynamics, described as rigid body motion, can be modeled with the aid of experimental information. The results of numerical modeling are compared with actual measurements of buoy motion and line tension from deepwater mooring of General Dynamics thick-discus shaped buoys. The results indicate that the method of characteristics provides a good simulation of buoy/mooring systems with respect to buoy response and line tension."
"Four ocean data buoy platforms are presently undergoing sea trial tests in the Gulf of Mexico. These buoys, at intervals, take limited and selected meteorological and oceanographic sensor data measurement, and automatically transmit these data at preprogrammed intervals (or upon request) to a landbased receiving, processing and distribution center. One basic platform design plus add-ons provide a small and versatile platform that is capable of meeting both moored (depths from 800 to 24,000 feet) or free drifting ocean data platform requirements. The buoys are presently equipped with an HF radio link; however, the system has been designed so that it may be readily converted for use with a satellite relay UHF communication link. Sufficient space is provided on-board the buoy for a primary power source that will maintain a moored platform at sea for a period of six months, and a drifter at sea for a period of three months."
"The efficiency of a novel numerical technique in the solution of acoustic wave problems in layered structures is here measured through extensive computer experimentation. The experimentation includes the comparison of the presently advanced technique to some classic ones usually applied in the presence of arbitrary profiles. The results corroborate the calculated reduction in solution time roughly proportional to the matrix size N when compared to the Gauss elimination technique, and twice the iteration number when compared to the Gauss Seidel technique. In addition, the numerical accuracy has been improved approximately by a factor of two while the storage requirement has been decreased roughly by a half. In many at-sea explorations or missions, real time acoustic predictions are essential for in-situ decision-making. The efficiency of the present algorithm should prove particularly desirable for fast and accurate computations of the acoustic wave field."

"A method of characterization of two-input two-output digital filters, which is particularly suitable for the analysis of cascaded networks of this type, is presented. This analysis approach has led to a new realization method of ladder-type digital filters. An example is used to illustrate the realization procedure."
"The advent of integrated digital communication systems will initiate a new period in speech communications research and development. The new and still adaptable systems environment together with the cost performance advantages of modern digital technologies will open up the way to practical utilization for many speech technology concepts and services that are not feasible within the framework of the present \"classical\" telephone networks."
"The frequency response required for the tone controls and frequency shaping networks in a hi-fidelity stereo amplifier is obtained by feedback techniques using integrated circuit operational amplifiers. The basic amplifier is discussed and the equations for the networks used to implement the bass and treble controls and RIAA phono compensation are derived. A practical design is shown for a 30-W rms stereo amplifier with a bandpass of 0.7 Hz to 50 kHz and 100 dB of excess gain at midrange frequencies. Test results are used to verify the performance of the technique described. Special considerations in the design and compensation of feedback amplifiers are discussed throughout the paper."
"Let g be a function defined upon R, with values in C and G its Fourier transform. Let\\nablabe the distribution upon R defined by\\nabla = \\sum\\min{k=0}\\max{N-1} \\gamma\\kappa\\delta(kT/N)where\\gamma\\kappa\\inRand δαis the Dirac function at abscissa α.\\nablais a discrete \"time window\" and its Fourier transform is a periodic function\\Gammaof the frequency (period N/T). Taking the Fourier transform of the product of\\nablaby g, we obtainF[\\nabla_{g}] = F [\\nabla] \\ast F[g] = \\Gamma \\ast G(* means convolution product).F[\\nabla_{g}]is also a periodic function of the frequency (period N/T) andF[\\nabla_{g}] (\\frac{j}{T}) = \\sum\\min{k=0}\\max{N-1} \\gamma\\kappa \\cdot g\\kappa \\cdot \\exp - 2i\\pi \\frac{jk}{N}wheregk = g(k(T/N)). F[\\nabla_{g}](j/T)for j=0,..., N-1 is obtained very efficiently using the FFT algorithm of Cooley and Tukey. Cleverly choosing the weights\\gamma\\kappa, |F[\\nabla](j/T)|^{2}for j = -N/2, ..., N/2-1 is a good estimator of the power spectrum of g. The vector γ (with components\\gamma\\kappa, k=0, ..., N-1) that maximize the ratio\\frac{\\int\\min{-1/T}\\max{1/T}|\\Gamma(\\lambda)|^{2} d\\lambda}{\\int\\min{-N/2T}\\max{N/2T}|\\Gamma(\\lambda)|^{2} d\\lambda}gives us an optimal discrete window.

"Several properties of finite-duration impulse-response (FIR) digital filters designed to have the maximum possible number of ripples are discussed and illustrated with examples. Such filters have been called extraripple filters. Among the properties of such filters are as follows. 1) Extraripple low-pass filters with fixed passband ripple δ1and stopband ripple δ2achieve the local minimum of transition width in the class of linear phase filters with fixed impulse-response duration of N samples. 2) For the case δ1= δ2the minimum transition width is roughly independent of Fp, the passband cutoff frequency. 3) For the case δ2< δ1, the minimum transition width decreases with increasing bandwidth. Several figures are included to show the relation between the transition width and bandwidth for low-pass filters."
"The fast Fourier transform algorithm is derived by means of successive fracturing of one-dimensional data strings into two-dimensional arrays. Using this formulation, a diagrammatic representation of mixed radix and highest radix FFT algorithms is derived. Using this representation, two broad classes of FFT hard-ware are explored, from the point of view of speed, parallelism, radix number, and type of memory."
"A primary-recognition computer program has been written to provide segmentation, acoustical parameters, and phonetic features of continuous speech, together with classification of some vowel and consonantal segments. Based on fundamental frequency, level, and duration information provided by the primary recognition program from short-term spectra, a procedure to mark stressed and reduced vowels is proposed. Listener judgments of stress and vowel reduction can be correlated with the physical parameters, but talker differences are apparent. It is clear that feature extraction at the segment level and at the suprasegmental level are mutually interactive."
"If broadcasting programs are to be transmitted in a digital network, 14 bits per sample are necessary to satisfy the noise requirements when linear quantization is applied. The use of an instantaneous compandor allows a reduction from 14 to 10 bits. Good results were obtained with a corresponding experimental system."
"An absolute bound on limit cycle oscillations in fixed-point digital filter implementations due to roundoff errors is presented. Periodicity of the limit cycles is assumed in the derivation. Useful design results are explicitly given for the case of second-order filter sections. In addition it is shown that this bound is equal to the rms bound of Sandberg and Kaiser for real roots, and is never more than a factor of two greater than the rms bound for complex roots for second-order filters."
"The radiation characteristics of a planar array of concentric rings are examined. By employing optimization techniques, control of the beamwidth and sidelobe level is accomplished. Treating the energy in the sidelobes as a criterion for optimization, side-lobes of equal amplitude are obtained."
"A method for finding the coefficients of an nth-order linear recursive digital filter, which gives the best least squares approximation to a desired pulse response over a finite interval, is presented. A relationship is derived between the approximating error corresponding to an optimal set of numerator coefficients and the error produced by an overdetermined set of linear equations, which is a function of the denominator coefficients only. This relation provides a computational algorithm for calculating the optimal coefficients by iteratively solving weighted sets of linear equations in terms of the denominator coefficients only. Both theoretical and numerical results are presented. Also, bounds are found on the interval in which the norm of the optimum error must lie."

"A method for filter input-output data analysis is presented whereby its transfer function is computed under normally operating conditions. The method offers the advantages of simplicity of computation and accurate estimation in the present of noise."
"Environmental noise induces frequency instabilities in lasers. By analyzing these instabilities, we can determine the characteristics of the noise and thus identify the source, using the laser, in effect, as a supersensitive \"microphone.\" The techniques described in this paper can be used for supersensitive detection and identification of extremely low-level noise sources."
"The mathematical theory underlying one of the techniques currently being used in linear prediction of speech is developed from an inner product formulation. This formulation produces a unified framework for studying the properties of autocorrelation equations. In particular, the solution and stability of the auto-correlation equations are studied in detail. Experimental stability results for finite word length analysis of speech are also presented."
"A method is presented for numerical calculation of z transforms of functions specified by rational Laplace transforms. The method uses a conversion to an equivalent differential system and calculation of the impulse response at equally spaced sample instants."
"A technique is introduced that analyzes the time evolutions of some parameters of the speech waveform. Suitable algorithms provide a description of these evolutions when a word is pronounced. Descriptions can be seen as the phrases of a language produced by a generative grammar. Recognition is performed by parsing the descriptions. Some experimental results are reported."
"A technique for automatic speaker verification is described in which voice pitch, low-frequency intensity, and the three lowest formant frequencies, all as functions of time, are the features used to represent an individual utterance. Verification consists of computing these features for a test utterance and comparing them with stored reference versions for the claimed identity. Before the test-versus-reference comparison is effected, the time dimension of the test utterance is warped to optimally register its intensity pattern onto the reference intensity pattern. Performance of the system is measured on a speaker population of moderate size. A variety of comparison formulas and various subsets of the five speech features are evaluated. The system responds either \"accept\" or \"reject\" to every utterance; \"no decision\" is not allowed. Automatic verification based solely upon voice pitch and intensity, both of which can be computed rapidly, yields average error rates below 1 percent."
"Exact expressions are given for the mean and variance of errors that result when rounding and truncation is performed on both sign-magnitude (SM) and two's complement (TC) finite accuracy number representations. The results are significantly different from those of the often-used continuous model in the important case of one- or two-bit quantization."
"In a digital filter realized with fixed-point arithmetic, there is a peculiar phenomenon known as limit-cycle oscillation, which is due to roundoff errors. For floating-point arithmetic, it has been conjectured that its amplitude is negligibly small, if it does exist. This paper shows that limit-cycle oscillations can exist in floating-point digital filters and that their amplitude can be large. Also, conditions for the existence of limit-cycle oscillations are derived."

"A solution is given to the problem of deconvolving two time sequences using discrete Fourier transform (DFT) techniques when one of the sequences is of infinite duration. Both input- and impulse-response deconvolution problems are considered. Results are summarized of a computer study of the algorithm that performs the deconvolution iteratively, using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm at each stage."
"An integer matrix method for implementation of the bilinear transformation is discussed and extended to a more general case that is useful in the design of digital filters."
"A study of the relationship between the syntactic and prosodic organization of spoken algebraic expressions is reported. It was found that subjects were very consistent in their placement of junctures when reading algebraic expressions slowly. Furthermore, there was an almost perfect correlation between measured silence and perceived juncture. Rules were developed for inserting parentheses based on the location and measured duration of silence intervals in an utterance. Listeners were asked to insert parentheses, given the spoken form, and the consistency of their answers was measured by a chi-square test. For those cases where there was listener agreement on a single answer, the rules were tested and found to agree with the listeners from 91 to 95 percent of the time. Mathematically experienced and mathematically naive listeners displayed similar performance that suggests that the acoustic cues used by the speaker to indicate syntactic structure in this restricted domain of discourse may have a more general applicability."
"Two major obstacles have hindered progress in the development of speech processing aids for the deaf. The first is a lack of basic knowledge as to how speech is acquired, produced, and perceived. The second is a paucity of objective, evaluative data on potentially useful aids. This paper reviews progress in the development of speech processing aids, both for speech perception and for speech training. Progress with training aids is quite promising and reasonably positive evaluative data are currently being obtained. The use of synthetic speech as a research tool in simulating speech problems is discussed and preliminary simulation data are presented."
"The electrotactile sound detector described here is designed to enable deaf persons to detect and localize sounds. Two microphones are worn bilaterally on the head, the sounds received are converted to electrical pulses, and the pulses are fed to two electrodes applied to the forehead. Differences in intensity of the pulses permit the wearer to localize the source of a sound. Additional information is furnished about the rhythmic patterning of sounds."
"The feasibility of converting English text into speech using an inexpensive computer and a small amount of stored data has been investigated. The text is segmented into breath groups, the orthography is converted into a phonemic representation, lexical stress is assigned to appropriate syllables, then the resulting string of symbols is converted by synthesis-by-rule into the parameter values for controlling an analogue speech synthesizer. The algorithms for performing these conversions are described in detail and evaluated independently, and the intelligibility of the resulting synthetic speech is assessed by listening tests."
"An experiment was performed in which the authors attempted to recognize a set of unknown sentences by visual examination of spectrograms and machine-aided lexical searching. Ninteen sentences representing data from five talkers were analyzed. An initial partial transcription in terms of phonetic features was performed. The transcription contained many errors and omissions: 10 percent of the segments were omitted, 17 percent were incorrectly transcribed, and an additional 40 percent were transcribed only partially in terms of phonetic features. The transcription was used by the experimenters to initiate computerized scans of a 200-word lexicon. A majority of the search responses did not contain the correct word. However, following extended interactions with the computer, a word-recognition rate of 96 percent was achieved by each investigator for the sentence material. Implications for automatic speech recognition are discussed. In particular, the differences between the phonetic characteristics of isolated words and of the same words when they appear in sentences are emphasized."
"The ability of listeners to perform some speaker verification tasks has been measured experimentally and compared with the performance of an automatic system for speaker verification. A test presentation in the subjective experiments consists of a pair of utterances. One of these is drawn from the recordings of a group of speakers designated customers while the second utterance is either a distinct recording from the same customer or the recording of an impostor. Listeners must respond whether the utterances are from the same or different speakers. The impostor classes that have been considered are casual impostors making no attempt to mimic customers, trained professional mimics, and an identical twin of a customer. Listener performance is specified by the two types of error that can be committed."
"An audio response unit has been built that synthetizes messages composed of a fixed sentence and any number from 0-999 999. The method used is synthesis by concatenation of words, and automatic corrections on pitch and rhythm are used to improve naturalness and intelligibility. The synthesizer is a part of a channel vocoder. This audio response unit is to be used in a telephone exchange to answer cost inquiries from the subscribers. Larger applications using touch-tone telephone as data input device are under consideration."
"This paper presents a model for machine recognition of connected speech and the details of a specific implementation of the model, the HEARSAY system. The model consists of a small set of cooperating independent parallel processes that are capable of helping in the decoding of a spoken utterance either individually or collectively. The processes use the \"hypothesize-and-test\" paradigm. The structure of HEARSAY is illustrated by considering its operation in a particular task situation: voice-chess. The task is to recognize a spoken move in a given board position. Procedures for determination of parameters, segmentation, and phonetic descriptions are outlined. The use of semantic, syntactic, lexical, and phonological sources of knowledge in the generation and verification of hypotheses is described. Preliminary results of recognition of some utterances are given."

"We summarize work between 1969 and 1972 in a continuing project With two objectives: to produce acceptable synthetic speech directly from English text; and to demonstrate with speech synthesis a detailed model of human articulatory movements. Work in the four-year period has yielded moderately accurate rules for predicting the occurrence of pauses and lesser breaks in the sentence; rules for vowel duration in many conditions, not just primary stressed syllables immediately before a pause; rules for contextual variations of consonants; and rules for durational and other allophonic variations on consonants at word boundaries. Presently we are studying natural speech to quantify and add detail to these rules, and we are working to extend the vocal tract model to closer agreement with human articulation and vocal cord control."
"The influence of harmonic distortion on the performance of ordinary hearing aids is discussed, as well as several kinds of possible distortions found in the transient state when compression is introduced. Transient response was determined for several hearing aids with compression that are available on the market. It is shown that each transient response is composed of two parts: the first part is determined by the frequency response of the whole transmission channel; the second one by the transient response of compression. The latter may cause overshoots, during which large distortions are found in some hearing aids. In others, a superposition of, or a modulation by, the damped low-frequency oscillation was observed at the output. Examples of such distortion are presented."
"A discrete-word recognition system utilizing a word dictionary and phonological rules is described. In this system, nine distinctive features are extracted from a discrete-word input. Segmentation is performed using these features. Segmentation errors are corrected by applying a phoneme connecting rule. The input word is transformed into an input feature matrix. The comparison of this matrix with the standard derived from the dictionary is performed in the feature (matrix) space. Another method of segmentation is also described in which segmentation is performed using a duration dictionary. The effectiveness of utilizing a word dictionary and phonological rules in automatic discrete-word recognition is discussed."
"Following segmentation and phonetic classification in automatic recognition of continuous speech (ARCS), it is necessary to provide methods for linguistic decoding, In this work a graph search procedure, based on the Fano algorithm, is used to convert machine-contaminated phonetic descriptions of speaker performance into standard orthography. The information utilized by the decoder consists of a syntax, a lexicon containing transcription variation for each word, and performance-based statistics from acoustic analysis. The latter contain information related to automatic segmentation and classification accuracy and certainty (anchor-point) data. A distinction is made between speaker- and machine-dependent corruption of phonetic input strings. Preliminary results are presented and discussed, together with some considerations for evaluation."
"Linguistic and perceptual arguments suggest that, in speech recognition systems, syntactic hypotheses should be formed before phonemic segments are identified. Prosodic features can provide some cues to constituent structure. In a variety of texts and excerpts from conversations, spoken by several talkers, a decrease in voice fundamental frequency (F0) usually occurred at the end of each major syntactic constituent, and an increase in F0occurred near the beginning of the following constituent. A computer program based on this regularity correctly detected over 80 percent of all syntactically predicted boundaries. Some boundaries between minor constituents were also detected by the fall-rise patterns in F0. False boundary detections resulted from F0variations at boundaries between vowels and consonants, but most such false alarms could be eliminated by setting a minimum percent variation in F0for a boundary detection. Sentence boundaries were accompanied by large F0increases and substantial pauses. The categories of constituents affect boundary detection results, with noun phrase-verbal sequences showing particularly infrequent detection. Prosodic cues to stress patterns and stress-to-syntax rules may be used to detect other aspects of syntactic structure. Syntactic structure hypotheses might then be used to guide phonetic recognition procedures within constituents."
"In order to assess current efforts devoted to reading machine design, it is first necessary to develop a set of requirements for an ideal device. Direct translation aids are then seen to lack several of these desirable features, and more general, linguistically based techniques are then examined. Structural properties of English are found to be obtainable from the orthographic representation, and these abstract relations can then be used to infer structural correlates in the output speech waveform. Current knowledge is centered largely at the word level, but several correlates of higher order units have been studied and rules for their behavior have been implemented in working systems. Finally, direct assessment of speech synthesized by rule has shown that even currently available techniques can yield speech acceptable to blind users."
"After more than two decades of research it is now possible to construct a high-performance reading system for the blind that will produce synthetic speech from printed text. The entire process can be carried out automatically by computer and associated special-purpose devices. As a first step toward the eventual deployment of a reading system, we have begun an evaluation study in collaboration with faculty and students at the University of Connecticut and with trainees at the Veterans Administration Eastern Blindness Rehabilitation Center. Questions to be answered concern the comprehensibility and educational uses of the output and the technical and economic resources required to make automated reading services accessible to progressively larger groups of blind people."
"A visual pitch display is described. This extracts fundamental frequency by low-pass filtering and displays frequency as a function of time on a storage oscilloscope. Three studies with deaf children are described. In the first it is found that the subjects have poor voluntary pitch control, despite generally good oral skills. In the second it is shown that simple pitch control can be learned quickly with the use of the visual display. However, traditional noninstrumental techniques are found to be almost as effective. In the third study, a profoundly deaf girl learns to control voice register and to generate acceptable intonation patterns within words and sentences. Unfortunately, this has no immediate effect on her everyday communicative speech. It is suggested that would-be designers of speech processing aids for the deaf should take note of two of the implications of these findings: 1) instrumental techniques may offer little or no advantage over properly applied traditional techniques for the teaching of certain skills; and 2) the process of modifying a child's communicative behavior is a complex one in which the technical aid has only a limited role to play. Unless use of the speech processing aid is incorporated in a meaningful way into an effective total program, its benefits are likely to be minimal."
"A computer-simulated parallel formant synthesizer has been used to copy short samples of human speech. It is possible to make the synthetic speech almost indistinguishable from the natural in spectrum, waveform, and by earphone listening, provided that the synthetic glottal pulse is derived by inverse filtering a typical natural vowel from the same talker. Various other pulse shapes have been tried, such as the combination of cosine segments suggested by various workers as a close approximation to human glottal pulses. For producing speech acceptable as natural, none of these idealized pulse shapes has been as successful as those derived by inverse filtering. However, the subjective differences are small compared with the differences that would be caused by reverberation when listening to a loudspeaker in an ordinary room with good acoustics; it has been demonstrated that under such listening conditions, the phase structure of glottal pulses is of no importance."

 "A computer simulation was performed to demonstrate the feasibility of delta modulation (DM) as a simple alternative to pulse-code modulation (PCM) for encoding the control signals of a voiced-speech synthesizer. Quantized signals representing the time variations of pitch period, amplitude, and the first three formant frequencies, all band limited to 16 Hz, were available in a 1500-b/s PCM format. Each of the five signals was over sampled at 100 Hz for delta encoding, resulting in a representation at 500 b/s (an information rate utilized recently for an adequate PCM representation of the control signals). Low-pass filtered versions of the DM signals were used to synthesize the original all-voiced utterance with a quality very close to that obtaining in the original 1500-b/s system. Both \"linear\" and \"adaptive\" delta modulators were considered; in the latter case, the step size is adapted continuously to the changing slope statistics of an input signal and this provides more efficient encoding. When additional band limiting was applied to the original control signals, resulting in a 700-b/s representation adaptive DM at 250 b/s was sufficient to encode the information without further degradation of the synthetic speech."
"The autocorrelation method of linear prediction is formulated in the time, autocorrelation, and spectral domains. The analysis is shown to be that of approximating the short-time signal power spectrum by an all-pole spectrum. The method is compared with other methods of spectral analysis such as analysis-by-synthesis and cepstral smoothing. It is shown that this method can be regarded as another method of analysis-by-synthesis where a number of poles is specified, with the advantages of noniterative computation and an error measure which leads to a better spectral envelope fit for an all-pole spectrum. Compared to spectral analysis by cepstral smoothing in conjunction with the chirp z transform (CZT), this method is expected to give a better spectral envelope fit (for an all-pole spectrum) and to be less sensitive to the effects of high pitch on the spectrum. The normalized minimum error is defined and its possible usefulness as a voicing detector is discussed."
"With the exception of relatively sophisticated methods such as cepstrum analysis, the problem of reliable pitch-period extraction has remained largely unsolved. This paper examines the feasibility of pitch-period extraction by means of the nonstationary error process resulting from adaptive-predictive quantization of speech. A real-time hard-ware system that may be realized at low cost is described."
"In this paper, a new algorithm based upon a digital inverse filter formulation is presented for automatically determining VU, a voiced-unvoiced decision (VU = 0 during unvoiced speech and VU = 1 during voiced speech), F0, the fundamental frequency, and Fi, i = 1, 2, 3, the first three formant frequencies, as a function of time. Formant trajectory estimates are obtained for all speech sounds that satisfy VU = 1."
"The use of a highly experienced, permanent panel of listeners has eliminated some of the variables of intelligibility testing and minimized many of the other objections to such testing. Variables such as training time, learning, and personnel changes are no longer significant. In addition, the problems of individual listener variation and less tangible questions of motivation and fatigue have been minimized. Consequently, measurements with low statistical variation and high repeatability have resulted; typically, less than 2 percent difference in intelligibility score has resulted from identical conditions measured nine months apart. This high reliability has also been noted in other psychoacoustic experiments in which the listeners have participated."
"This paper discusses the theoretical basis for representation of a speech signal by its short-time Fourier transform. The results of the theoretical studies were used to design a speech analysis-synthesis system which was simulated on a general-purpose laboratory digital computer system. The simulation uses the fast Fourier transform in the analysis stage and specially designed finite duration impulse response filters in the synthesis stage. The results of both the theoretical and computational studies lead to an understanding of the effect of several design parameters and elucidate the design tradeoffs necessary to achieve moderate information rate reductions."
"High-speed algorithms to compute the discrete Hadamard and Walsh transforms of speech waveforms have been developed. Intelligible speech has been reconstructed from dominant Hadamard or Walsh coefficients on a medium sized computer in a non-real-time mode. Degradation of some phonemes was noted at low bit rates of reconstruction, but the reconstruction could be improved by varying the position of the sampling window. A digital processor, which allows real-time analysis of speech to be conducted on the system, is described."
"The objectives of this investigation were twofold: 1) to demonstrate the utility of the nine-point speech \"goodness\" rating scale as a method for scaling user opinion of speech quality, and 2) to use this method to determine optimum parameters for differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM) systems with bit rates from 25.6 to 51.2 kb/s. Fifteen DPCM and pulse-code modulation (PCM) systems were simulated on a digital computer. The parameters investigated included the tradeoff between bandwidth and number of quantization levels, and the number of taps in the DPCM predictor network. A total of 248 ratings were obtained from 31 trained listeners for each of the systems under consideration. Both the intra- and interrater reliability of these data, as obtained from the speech \"goodness\" rating scale, were found to be greater than 0.95. Results indicated that: 1) at any bit rate, DPCM is significantly better than PCM; 2)DPCM with a three-tap predictor is not significantly better than DPCM with a one-tap predictor; 3)between 2.4 and 4.3 kHz changes in bandwidth are inconsequential in terms of user opinion; and 4) the number of quantization bits appears to be the primary determinant of speech quality judgment."
"This paper describes an implementation strategy for a vocal data management system (VDMS) being developed by the voice input/output project at the System Development Corporation. VDMS will accept connected speech of a language describable by 25-50 phrase equations and having a vocabulary of approximately 1000 words formed from about 100 data records. The strategy is based on the concept of predictive linguistic constraints (PLC). The present concepts of fixed directionality in parsing are replaced by a more generalized approach. To facilitate this flexibility, the system comprises a set of near-independent coroutines that are interconnected by a software busing structure. The VDMS acoustic processors verify the predictions. Very loose matching criteria are used for locating the predicted words. Special attention is given to word segments that are experimentally determined to be most invariant."
"When patients with hemispherectomies or temporal lobectomies listen to dichotic pairs of equal-intensity C-V syllables, they do poorly identifying the stimuli presented to the ear contralateral to the lesion. This effect is similar to that seen for normals, who in the same circumstances, perform poorly on the left-ear stimulus. (The ear contralateral to a lesion for patients and the left ear for normals will be designated the \"weak ear\", the ear ipsilateral to a patient's lesion and the right ear for normals will be called the \"strong ear\".) To further explore these phenomena we investigated the ability of stimuli other than C-V's in the strong ear to suppress the perception of C-V's in the weak ear. Suppression was found when the strong-ear stimulus was a vowel. Somewhat more suppression was seen when the strong-ear stimuli were computer-generated signals with acoustic features similar to C-V's (\"bleats\"). Suppression was seen even if the strong-ear vowels and bleats were 20-40 dB less intense than the syllables in the weak ear. A model was developed that interprets weaker suppression to be, in part, a consequence of the interaction of the auditory features of the dichotic signals prior to phonetic processing."
"The conventional methods for measuring speech intelligibility/discrimination present entire lists of words at constant levels whereas an adaptive procedure shifts levels within a single list according to a preselected strategy. The results reported in this paper indicate that adaptive testing of monosyllabic speech communication : 1) provides reasonably stable and accurate results with a CNC (words with a consonant-vowel-consonant structure) test vocabulary of 50 words; 2) permits an efficient description of selected points on the rising portion of an articulation function; and 3) gives the tester a number of flexible testing options such as choice of strategies and preselection of target scores. In addition, the potential exists for estimation of measurement errors both within and between test sessions, with these estimates based on either group or individual test responses."
"Various parameter sets-including a spectrum envelope, cepstrum, autocorrelation function, linear predictive coefficients, and partial autocorrelation coefficients (PAC's)- are evaluated experimentally to determine which constitutes the best parameter in spoken digit recognition. The principle of recognition is simple pattern matching in the parameter space with nonlinear adjustment of the time axis. The spectrum envelope and cepstrum attain the best recognition score of 100 percent for ten spoken digits of a single-male speaker. PAC's seem to be preferable because of their ease of extraction and theoretical orthogonalities; however, these PAC's tend to suffer from computation errors when computed by fixed-point arithmetic with a short accumulator length. We find two effective means to improve the errors; one is variable use of the PAC dimensions controlled by computation accuracy, and the other is smoothing along the time axis. With these improvements the PAC's offer almost 100 percent recognition."
 "The poles of a recently discussed [2] maximally flat sharp-cutoff low-pass filter are tabulated for various orders of the filter and various values of the parameters. Loci of these poles are also sketched for some representative orders."
"In power spectrum measurement, there are instances in which proportional bandwidth filtering is preferable to constant bandwidth filtering. One such instance is the analysis of sound and vibration from a rotating machine with a varying rotation frequency. The mathematics describing proportional bandwidth filtering are presented."
"The Halyo-McAlpine discrete model for product quantization is reconstructed using an error variable set having an even number of members. It is shown in this case that the noise variance associated with a continuous model becomes an upper rather than a lower bound on the variance of the product quantization noise. The modified error set is shown to be more consistent with binary data formats such as two's complement."
"The entries in X matrix of Power [1]-[3] and in Q matrix of Fielder [4] are further simplified. In fact, for n even one needs to calculate n/2 × n/2 elements, and for n odd, (n - 1)/2 × (n - 1)/2 elements of these matrices. This simplification is based on certain properties of the rows and columns of the Q and X matrices."
"Signal-to-noise ratio expressed in decibels may be generalized to the form10 \\log S^{a}/N^{b}, where S and N are, respectively, signal and noise values expressed in power units. In the usual definition of signal-to-noise ratio, the exponents a and b both assume values of +1, that is, the ratio a/b = 1. This study was designed to examine the optimum value of a/b as a predictor of speech transmission quality using two sets of speech transmission quality data. Results of factor analysis, multiple regression analyses, and canonical correlation analyses showed that values of a/b greater than one were better predictors of transmission quality than a/b = 1."
"Expressions for the statistics of the estimate of magnitude coherence between two random stationary Gaussian processes are presented. These statistics include the probability density function, the cumulative distribution function, the bias, and the variance of the estimator. The expressions presented are in convenient and accurate forms for digital computer evaluation. Graphical examples of the bias and variance are included. Simple approximations are also given for the maximum bias, variance, and mean-square error."

"The computational speed of special-purpose Fourier transformers has made redundant processing of data with very narrow resolution bandwidths feasible. One prominent application of this type of equipment is its use as an optimum receiver for detection of narrow-band signals with random phase and unknown frequency. As shown in this paper, the redundantly processed data can be usefully employed to improve the minimum detectable signal over that attainable with independent data. The relationships for processing gain with both time redundancy and frequency redundancy are developed. The values for the processing gains are presented as a function of the amount of redundancy in the data."
"For deciding the stability of a two-dimensional filter, it is of interest to determine whether or not a prescribed polynomial in the variables z1and z2is nonzero in the region|z_{1}| \\leq 1 \\cap |z_{2}| \\leq 1. A new procedure for testing for this property is given, which does not involve the use of bilinear tranformations. Key parts of the test involve the construction of a Schur-Cohn matrix and the checking for positivity on the unit circle of a set of self-inversive polynomials."
"The influence of coupling between flexural and extensional deformation and coupling between structure and acoustic volume on the dynamic response of piezoelectric ceramic transducer elements mounted on metal diaphragms is analyzed using three analytical methods: 1) classical boundary value techniques; 2) simple direct variational procedures; and 3) finite element methods. The analyses are able to predict the voltage output of the transducer, including resonant amplitudes and shapes, with reasonable accuracy and also to indicate critical front and back acoustic volume design parameters needed to control resonance. The finite element model includes a general formulation for axisymmetric layered shells of revolution (which degenerates to a circular plate), whose average normal displacement is coupled to the long wavelength motion of air in adjacent cavities (acoustic stiffness), ports (acoustic mass), and porous plugs (acoustic damping). The methods outlined here are also applicable to window-enclosure response to sonic boom excitation, skull-brain impact studies, and the study of respiratory mechanics."
"An important class of applications in digital signal processing involves the numerical solution of the convolution integral. These so-called numerical deconvolution problems are notoriously difficult to solve because of their inherent ill-conditioning. In this paper we present a characterization of this ill-conditioning based on a classical spectral decomposition of the discrete convolution. Factors prominently influencing the conditioning are identified and some explicit sensitivity measures are introduced."
"The signal-to-noise performance of two types of piezoelectric ceramic microphones designed for telephone applications is compared with that of two electret microphones. It is shown that for the microphone sensitivities considered the noise produced by low-cost preamplifiers suitable for low-voltage operation in a telephone set is the limiting factor. While the electret microphone-preamplifier combinations are some 23 dB more sensitive, they are also some 21 dB noisier than the ceramic-preamplifier types considered so that the resulting signal-to-noise ratios for the telephone bandwidth (C-message weighting) are comparable."
"A great deal of attention has been given recently to the theory of designing optimum, linear phase, finite impulse response (FIR) low-pass digital filters where N, the filter impulse response duration, was odd. In this paper it is shown that the inclusion of optimal filters with even values of N gives additional flexibility to the general filter design problem. In particular, it will be shown that for certain ranges of filter cut-off frequencies, length N filters (N may be either even or odd) have smaller ripple than length (N + 1) filters. Finally, the general properties of optimal filters with even values of N are discussed. These include: filter types, scaling procedures, Chebyshev solutions, and symmetry of the basic design curves. The necessary modifications to existing design programs for filters with odd values of N to give filters with even values of N are also discussed."
"A method for estimating the magnitude-squared coherence function for two zero-mean wide-sense-stationary random processes is presented. The estimation technique utilizes the weighted overlapped segmentation fast Fourier transform approach. Analytical and empirical results for statistics of the estimator are presented. The analytical expressions are limited to the nonoverlapped case; empirical results show a decrease in bias and variance of the estimator with increasing overlap and suggest a 50-percent overlap as being highly desirable when cosine (Hanning) weighting is used."
"An analysis of the three possible types of quantization effects in the direct form realization of finite impulse response (FIR) digital filters is presented. These quantization effects include roundoff noise, A-D noise, and filter frequency response errors due to coefficient quantization. Since the analysis of roundoff noise and A-D noise for the direct form is straightforward, this paper concentrates on an analysis of the effects of quantized coefficients on the resulting filter frequency response. Based on this analysis, statistical bounds on the error incurred in the frequency response of a filter due to coefficient quantization are developed and verified by extensive experimental data. Using these bounds, a procedure for applying known techniques for FIR filter design to the design of filters with finite word length coefficients is presented. On the whole, the direct form is shown to be a very attractive structure for realizing FIR filters."
"A new active canonic RC low-pass filter is given. The sensitivities, with respect to all passive and active circuit components, are low. The frequency limitations of the filter are derived based on the one-pole rolloff model of the operational amplifier (OA) and the results arrived at are compared with other well-known low-pass filters. Experimental results agree with the theoretical ones."
"The problem of developing discrete-time models for continuous systems from integral approximations is considered. In particular, the model obtained by approximating the input by a piecewise linear function is developed. By an appropriate approximation of this model, an equivalence between it and the bilinear transform model is established."

"In this paper useful design conditions for a phase-inverter speaker system with a drone cone, which realize a flat response, are given for the first time by applying the network synthesis theory to the sound-pressure transfer function of this speaker system. The design conditions are obtained in relation to the sound-pressure zero below the reproducing region for the cases of the general Butterworth and the general Chebyshev rational function characteristics, and also obtained in relation to the amount of ripple of the sound-pressure frequency response in the reproducing frequency region for the case of the general Chebyshev rational function characteristic. The effects of equivalent resistance of the box due to the absorbing material on the design conditions are also considered. The calculated sound-pressure frequency response based on the design conditions obtained agrees fairly well with the measured response. Comparison of the sound-pressure frequency response of this speaker system with those of the closed box and the bass-reflex system is also given."
"The fast computational algorithm based on matrix Kronecker products yields the Hadamard transform in a scrambled order of sequencies. A computational algorithm is developed to arrange the transform in an increasing order of sequencies. The unscrambling is achieved by exchanges of components and requires no additional storage."
"The directivity index Diof an underwater sound source usually is approximated because of the difficulty involved in performing the required power measurements and integrating over all angles. A simulation study conducted at the Underwater Sound Reference Division resulted in a model of a Dimeasuring system that minimizes the complexity of measuring the power profile about a sphere with accuracy to within ±0.1 dB. A system was assembled in accordance with the model and experimental measurements have been made in a shallow lake. The instrumentation and measurement techniques are presented in this paper. A complete three-dimensional power profile can be obtained in approximately 10 min running time with conventional hardware. Measured values of Diare in close agreement with theoretical calculations based on a perfect piston raditors, except for patterns with significant sidelobes."
"A study has been made of linear applications of 4- layer p-n-p-n devices. Biased as transistor tetrodes, these elements are characterized as to dc and small-signal parameters. Tetrode audio automatic gain control AGC circuits are devised and their controlled gain characteristics are discussed."
"This paper describes a new method for estimating the vocal tract area function directly from the acoustic speech waveform. Dynamic changes of the area functions and formants in voiced speech sounds are obtainable. The filtering processes of the inverse filter model and an acoustic tube model of speech are analyzed and they are shown to be identical, with the reflection coefficients in the acoustic tube model as a common factor, thus making possible the extraction of the reflection coefficients by the inverse filter processing of the speech signal. The discrete area function can easily be obtained from the set of reflection coefficients. Analysis examples for vowels, diphthongs, and consonants in vowel-consonant-vowel utterances are given."
"The personal quality of sustained vowels uttered by eight male talkers was represented multidimensionally in a psychological auditory space (PAS) by means of Kruskal's multidimensional scaling procedure based on the perceptual confusion in talker discrimination tests. Physical properties of the vowels were analyzed in terms of elementary acoustical parameters, such as formant frequencies, slope of glottal source spectrum, mean fundamental pitch frequency, and rapid fluctuation of fundamental pitch period. Then the relationship between the configuration on the PAS and the acoustical parameters was examined through multiple correlation and regression analysis. The contribution of those acoustical parameters to the personal quality of the five Japanese vowels and the relative contributions of the vocal tract and the glottal source characteristics are demonstrated quantitatively. These results were obtained partially, by utilizing hybrid voices in which the source wave or the formant frequency pattern was interchanged among different talkers."
"This paper describes an attempt to develop a computer-based system of speech-training aids for the deaf. Some of the problems associated with the speech of the deaf are briefly reviewed. Reasons for attempting to apply a digital computer to the problem of speech training are given. The system and its display capabilities are described. The importance of evolving such a system through a close interaction of developers and users is stressed."
"The development of saturation diving has enabled man to work in the sea at great depths and for long periods of time. This advance has resulted, in part, as a consequence of the substitution of helium for nitrogen in breathing gas mixtures. However, the utilization of HeO2breathing mixtures at high ambient pressures has caused problems in speech communication; in turn, electronic aids have been developed to improve diver communication. These helium speech unscramblers attempt to process variously the grossly unintelligible speech resulting from the effects of helium-oxygen breathing mixtures and ambient pressure, and to reconstruct such signals in order to provide adequate voice communication. This paper presents a discussion of the effects of HeO2/P on speech and then describes some of the techniques used to \"unscramble\" the distorted speech. Included among the techniques are: 1) frequency subtraction; 2) tape recorder playback; 3) vocoder approaches; 4) digital coding; and 5) convolution processing. In addition, a generalized evaluation of these approaches is included."
"In this paper, a set of simple, approximate relationships between FIR, linear phase, low-pass filter parameters is presented. Based on these relationships, it is shown how an existing, readily available, filter design program can be used to efficiently design low-pass filters that meet or exceed arbitrary input specifications."
"This correspondence proposes a method to check the stability of two-dimensional recursive filters. In this method the Jury table is modified and used to check the first condition of Huang's theorem. Some examples are solved to illustrate the method."
"The application of the Bandler-Charalambous method using extremely large values of p, typically 10,000 to the problem of choosing the coefficients of a recursive digital filter to meet arbitrary specifications on the magnitude characteristics, is described. The Fletcher (1970) method is used in conjunction with least pth optimization and is compared with the well-known Fletcher-Powell method. Some relevant design ideas, such as local optimality checking by perturbation, increasing the order complexity of the filter through growing filter sections, and meeting the stability requirements by using a pole inversion technique, have been implemented. A general description of a computer program package that uses these ideas, along with some illustrative examples are given."
"The loudspeaker system small-signal figure of merit is a useful performance criterion that must be evaluated and used with some care. In practice, this figure of merit is significantly reduced by enclosure dissipation, including that contributed by filling materials."

"Expansion of the basic short-term autocorrelation equation into sum-of-products form shows that common factors occur in a predictable order. When the data are assumed to have zero value outside the interval of interest and the number of autocorrelation coefficients is much less than the number of data points, factoring can reduce the number of multiplications by up to 46 percent."
"It is proved that the z transform of a sequence of data values cannot be exactly computed using a binary number representation for values of z on the unit circle, except z =±1, z = ±j.

"A new realization of nonrecursive digital filters that are used to operate on analog signals is proposed. This realization requires no multiplications, and exploits the relative simplicity of delta modulation as a means for analog to digital conversion. This realization also permits a mechanization as a \"very fast\" digital filter, using read-only memory (ROM). An evaluation of this realization in terms of computation time storage requirements and mean-squared error is presented. These characteristics are compared with their counterparts for existing realization methods of nonrecursive digital filters. Computer simulation results that tend to confirm the theoretical results of the error analysis are included."
"There is evidence that in addition to standard digital filter forms such as the direct, parallel, and cascade forms, digital lattice and ladder filters may play an important role in finite word length implementation problems. In this paper, techniques are developed in detail for efficiently synthesizing digital lattice and ladder filters from any stable direct form. In one form, a lattice filter canonic in terms of multiplies and delays is obtained. An internal scaling procedure is also introduced that will be of importance for optimizing one of the lattice forms for finite word length implementation."
"A 50 W/4 Ω complementary symmetry audio amplifier concept is described. The amplifier is designed to meet ultimate quality requirements with particular emphasis on lack of transient intermodulation distortion. Excellent phase and amplitude linearity is obtained using low feedback value, class A operation for most of the signal time, and a fully symmetric dc-coupled high frequency design."
"The Padé approximant technique provides a quick design of recursive digital filters. An added advantage of the technique lies in that spectrum shaping requirements as well as linear phase constraints can be handled easily, even for higher order filters. This is important in supplying initial guesses of the filter parameters to iterative routines that would then seek a locally optimal design solution. These advantages are among those discussed in a partly tutorial presentation of the technique that relates to filter needs found in data transmission systems. In addition, the question of stability is treated and a new criterion is presented. The criterion provides sufficient conditions in establishing stability for a filter designed by using the Padé approximant technique."
"This paper presents a general-purpose computer program which is capable of designing a large Class of optimum (in the minimax sense) FIR linear phase digital filters. The program has options for designing such standard filters as low-pass, high-pass, bandpass, and bandstop filters, as well as multipassband-stopband filters, differentiators, and Hilbert transformers. The program can also be used to design filters which approximate arbitrary frequency specifications which are provided by the user. The program is written in Fortran, and is carefully documented both by comments and by detailed flowcharts. The filter design algorithm is shown to be exceedingly efficient, e.g., it is capable of designing a filter with a 100-point impulse response in about 20 s."
"A method of phoneme recognition of connected speech is described. Input to the system is assumed to consist of the 24 continuant phonemes in connected English speech. The system first categorizes each successive 20-ms segment of the input speech utterance as either voiced fricative, voiced nonfricative, unvoiced fricative or no-speech, Utilizing a measure of the relative energy balance between low and high frequencies. Next, the recognition of each 20-ms segment is performed from a distribution of axis-crossing intervals of speech prefiltered to emphasize each formant frequency range. Segmentation is performed from the results of the recognition of each 20-ms segment and from changes in categorization. Finally, the results of the recognition of each 20-ms segment between each pair of segmentation boundaries are combined and the phonemic sound occurring most frequently is printed out. The system has been trained for a single male speaker. Preliminary results for this speaker and for four 3-4-s sentences indicate: a correct categorization decision for about 97 percent of the input 20-ms segments, a correct recognition for about 78 percent of the input 20-ms segments, and an overall correct phoneme recognition for about 87 percent of the input phonemes."
"The present study demonstrates that spectrograms of Swedish utterances can be read with great accuracy under nontrivial conditions. This result is to be attributed primarily to the development of a formalized strategy that was designed to make it possible for spectrogram readers to derive information on certain grammatical features of an utterance such as word class, word boundaries, endings, and function elements. The input to this strategy consists of segmental phonetic features that the subjects extract from the spectrographic display and of information on prosodic features such as stress and tonal accent. The latter information is specified on the spectrogram for each syllable. An experimental situation is thus created that differs from the informal recognition of unknown utterances from spectrograms. A subject can base his final identification of lexical items not only on segmental phonetic features but also on an error-free specification of prosodic features and, in so far as he has been able to use the strategy successfully, on grammatical information. Experimental results are reported indicating that subjects improve their performance markedly with the aid of the strategy. In conclusion, attention is drawn to the important role that grammar and prosody appear to play in the present experiments and to the implications of the findings for future work on automatic speech recognition and speech perception."
"An equiripple error constraint was used to design linear approximations to\\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}. Several examples are presented including one having a peak error of less than one percent, which is significantly less than the error obtained by using other design criteria. The mean and standard deviation of the relative error are also tabulated as are earlier results obtained by other authors."
"Several new methods of realization of an arbitrary digital transfer function are proposed. The final realization is in the form of a two-input two-output digital filter configuration with one input variable constrained to be a multiple of one of the output variables. All realizations are canonic with respect to the delays but use different numbers of adders and multipliers. Examples illustrating the methods are included."

"The applications of Josephson junctions to the measurement of low-frequency magnetic fields and voltages are reviewed. The relevant ideas of flux quantization and Josephson tunneling are very briefly reviewed, and the various methods of making Josephson junctions mentioned. The two basic types of magnetic sensor, the dc superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and the RF SQUID, are described in some detail. Their theory of operation, noise limitations, and application to practical devices are discussed. The resolution of SQUID's commonly used in an analog mode is 10-4to 10-3Φ0/√Hz, where Φ0is the flux quantum. The basic sensor may be used in conjunction with a flux transformer to measure magnetic fields (with a resolution of 10-14T/√Hz), magnetic-field gradients (with a resolution of 10-12T/m/√Hz), and magnetic susceptibilities. The SQUID may also be used as a voltmeter. The resolution is limited by the Johnson noise developed in the resistance of the low-temperature circuit, provided that this resistance is not too large: the upper limit in the liquid-He4temperature range appears to be a few tens of ohms."
"Some recently developed superconducting instrument systems which are based upon the use of a highly reliable thin-film superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) are discussed in detail. These SQUID's, which are shown to have a noise temperature of less than 2 × 10-4K, are capable of measuring: 1) magnetic flux with a sensitivity of 10-11Gċcm2rms/√Hz; 2) magnetic field with a sensitivity of 10-11G rms/√Hz; 3) magnetic field gradient with a sensitivity of 10-11(G/cm) rms/√Hz. We present construction details and performance data on systems capable of making the above measurements."
"A shift register is described which employs as information bits the flux quantum vortices occurring in Josephson junctions of extended dimensions. The positions of the vortices can be controlled and manipulated by an appropriately designed circuit geometry and by application of currents and magnetic fields. The time required for switching of the position of a vortex can approach the period of the Josephson plasma oscillation (∼10 ps) and the intrinsic energy dissipation is typically ≲ 10-18J/shift."
"A weak link between two bulk superconductors can exhibit Josephson effects and can be used as a fast sensitive detector or mixer for electromagnetic radiation. Emphasis is placed on the millimeter and submillimeter range where such applications are potentially most important, though such devices should also work well at lower frequencies. The peculiar properties of the weak link make possible a variety of modes of operation including one in which it is both local oscillator and mixer. These modes of operation are analyzed and the pivotal experiments are reviewed. Noise and impedance matching are considered and comparison is made with other types of detectors of millimeter and submillimeter waves."
"The dc characteristics of superconducting weak links, irradiated by one and two microwave frequencies and the dependence of the absorbed microwave power on the dc current, are evaluated. Within the constant voltage steps, the ac current generated in the weak link is synchronous with the incident microwaves or their mixing products. In the case of two incident microwave frequencies within the constant voltage steps, the dependence of the ratio of power-absorption variation on the impressed dc current at the two frequencies is governed by modified Manley-Rowe equations."
"A millimeter and submillimeter microwave source is described in which a point-contact Josephson junction is used as both the emitter and as a homodyne detector of the microwave radiation. The microwave radiation is conveyed from the Josephson junction to the room-temperature environment outside the Dewar of liquid helium by an oversize waveguide. A room-temperature Fabry-Perot resonator refocuses the radiation on the oversize waveguide which returns the radiation to the emitting junction which also serves as a coherent detector with sensitivity 10-15W/√Hz. The detector is sufficiently sensitive that the emitted power of 10-12W can be detected with high signal-to-noise ratio. Power required by the junction is of the order 10-6W from the bias supply. For the experiments reported, the wavelength of the emission could be varied over discrete wavelengths between 1.1 and 2.6 mm by varying the voltage bias across the junction. These wavelengths corresponded to the resonant frequencies of a cavity tightly coupled to the Josephson junction, and the frequencies can be changed by modifying the geometry of the cavity."
"We report measurements on the noise limitations of superconducting thin films operating as thermal detectors (bolometers) and as current-dependent detectors. By making measurements in each mode on the same film it is possible to make a comparative study of the noise limitations for both detection mechanisms in the same device. Thin tin films with normal state sheet resistances on the order of 100 Ω per square have been studied. The devices were scribed to produce total normal state resistances on the order of 10 kΩ and were mounted in the vacuum chamber of a demountable tail Dewar so that they were not in direct contact with liquid helium. The resulting bolometers have response times and sensitivities similar to those of Martin and Bloor. The dominant noise mechanisms we have observed appear to be Johnson noise in the thermal mode and 1/f noise in the current mode. These results confirm previous conclusions regarding the sensitivity of these films as radiation detectors."
"The high-frequency properties of superconductors are reviewed, including the London, Pippard, and Mattis-Bardeen surface impedance, and techniques for measuring and separating losses are discussed. Residual resistance mechanisms are described and evaluated, including high field effects. The state of knowledge is shown to be adequate for engineering design. Applications of superconducting resonators and lines to filters, tuners, oscillators, amplifiers and mixers, transmission lines, antennas, optical and radiation detection, and materials research are discussed."
"An investigation of machined superconducting lead cavities operating in the circular cylindrical TE011mode at 34.8 GHz is reported. Measured values of the surface resistance and the shift of the resonance frequency are presented and compared with calculated values. Construction criteria for high-Q cavities are proposed, based on a discussion of the different loss mechanisms in a cavity. According to these criteria 10 cavities were processed and investigated by Q measurements. The surfaces were examined by microscope. A new untraditional method for examining machined surfaces was applied. Recognizing that a surface with surface defects has both inferior electrical properties and decreased mechanical strength compared with a perfect surface, different surfaces were treated in ultrasonic baths in order to examine the mechanical strength. The degree of destruction of the surfaces was compared with the Q values of cavities with surfaces constructed in the same way."
"This is a review paper concisely tracing the development of miniature superconductive coaxial transmission lines from the original invention as a vertical channel signal delay line for fractional nanosecond pulse oscillography to present-day work towards highly compact, broad-band, and low-loss telecommunication cables. The present state of development yields a 1.6-mm coaxial line operating at 4.2K and having Pb conductors, polyethylene dielectric, Z0= 50 ± 0.3 Ω and a 1-GHz attenuation of the order of 1 dB/km. The attenuation up to 1 GHz is mainly due to dielectric losses."
"An equivalent circuit has been developed for the time-dependent dissipating state of superconductivity which accompanies quantum phase slip. This equivalent circuit is used here to analyze the superconducting thin-film ring magnetometer and to determine its operating characteristics in terms of measurable circuit parameters."
"Superconducting coils have been utilized in a broad range of applications which continues to expand. Initially, they were used for small physics experiments in the laboratory. More recent applications involve superconducting coils on a scale that would have been unrealistic only a few years ago. This paper is concerned with some of these applications. After a brief review of the main characteristics of superconductors and superconducting windings in general, specific applications are discussed. These include high-energy physics, controlled thermonuclear fusion, magnetohydrodynamic power generation, inductive energy storage, and levitation of high-speed ground vehicles. Photographs and illustrations are included to describe some of the existing systems as well as some systems which are presently conceptual in nature."
"Recent developments in superconductors have made possible the application of superconductivity in the windings of electric machinery. Extensive studies have been made, and several experimental superconducting machines have been built and tested. In synchronous machines, the higher currents and flux densities in a superconducting field winding offer savings in size, weight, and cost. In homopolar machines, the greater flux densities make possible higher terminal voltages. This, with the development of liquid-metal current collection, makes homopolar machines a feasible alternative to conventional dc machines for high-power applications."
"The entire program of the development of superconducting dc machines at International Research & Development Co., Ltd. (IRD) from 1963 onwards is covered. The early thinking on the choice of the type of machine and the reasons for selecting the homopolar are described; the first 50-hp model motor and the 3250- hp Fawley motor are then discussed. A brief account is given of the testing of the latter both at IRD and Fawley. The bulk of the paper is devoted to an account of the approach to the development of these machines at IRD, concerning principally the areas of current collection, magnetic screening, and terminal voltage, The importance of achieving a high current density in brushes is explained and an account is given of a new method of current collection developed at IRD and is based upon the use of carbon fibers. A brief discussion is made on superconducting windings, refrigeration systems, speed control, and the effects of failure of the cryogenic plant. Finally, reference is made to the superconducting marine propulsion system now under construction at IRD."

"A 100-mW Gunn-diode oscillator has been coupled to a 5 × 108Q factor superconducting Nb cavity. The frequency stability is then improved up to 1.8 × 10-11over a measuring time of 10s. The long-term frequency shift is removed by placing the cavity in a constant pressure vessel cooled by the He bath. The FM noise has been measured at modulating frequencies as close to the carrier as 0.1 Hz."
"By precise manufacturing methods, 1.6-mm 50-Ω superconductive coaxial lines having few impedance irregularities (0.2 to 0.3 Ω) have been produced. Their attenuation constant at 4.2 K shows a smooth gradual increase upto 12.4 GHz in proportion to frequency. The loss at 1 GHz is 0.7 dB/km for the line using tetra fluoroethylene-hexa fluoropropylene (FEP) and 1.6 dB/km for the line using polyethylene (PE)."
"The unit distance property of the Gray code can be used in pulse distributor circuits which are hazard-free. A modified synchronous Gray-code counter is used as the basis of a programmable pulse distributor described in this letter. The complete circuit is iterative in its interconnection pattern and therefore can be extended easily. A possible application of this type of pulse distributors, as a rate multiplier is also considered."

The electrical heating, via transparent electrodes, of a thin film of liquid adjacent to the roughened surface transforms the glass into a light scattering surface. The fundamental thermal, electrical, and optical characteristics of the display element are reported.

"The basic principles of IMPATT diodes as microwave devices are reviewed and the current status of these devices concerning power output and efficiency is given. The main purpose of this paper, however, is to discuss the nonlinear properties of these diodes which are useful in the design of amplifiers, oscillators, and other microwave devices. The main results of this paper are obtained from a digital computer analysis where an approximate, but realistic, diode model is employed. A detailed comparison of complementary silicon diodes as well as GaAs diodes concerning power output and efficiency is given. The effects of doping profile, current density, temperature, and material parameters on the performance of these devices have been investigated and are summarized. Saturation effects which limit the efficiency and power output of these devices are described and optimum efficiencies which can be achieved for various doping profiles are given. A comparison between single-sided and double-drift diodes in both silicon and GaAs is also presented."
"A generalization of Floquet's theorem is presented for periodically loaded closed waveguides possessing a certain class of higher symmetries which includes the screw and glide symmetries. These symmetries frequently appear in microwave structures such as filters, traveling-wave tubes, and traveling-wave antennas. The theorem states that the natural modes are eigenvectors of the symmetry operator characterizing the structure. An alternative derivation of the theorem using an equivalent network representation leads naturally to a simple method for constructing the qualitative dispersion (Brillouin) diagrams for structures with screw or glide symmetry."
"Bandlimited functions play important roles in the design of signal transmission systems; antennas; digital, analog, and optical filters; tapered transmismon lines, etc. The basic problem arising in all the above-mentioned applications consists in approximating a given nonbandlimited response with a bandlimited system function.

 "Using the Hilbert transform, a simple expression is derived for the reactance of a dipole antenna in terms of the radiation resistance which is assumed known. Since the radiation resistance can be found from the far-field equations (i.e., Fourier transform of the antenna current distribution), it is shown that it is not necessary to determine the near field to obtain the antenna reactance. Numerical results are in excellent agreement with those available in the literature."

Applications to date are reviewed. Increasing use of the algorithm in a widening variety of areas is foreseen."
"This short paper serves as an introduction to the four invited papers that follow it by describing their coverage and by commenting on recent trends in the design of microwave tubes for high-power applications."
"After 28 years of considerable research and development, two types of traveling-wave tube (TWT) circuits have captured the major portion of the production business. For broad-band applications, the helix is almost exclusively used, while for high-average-power applications, such as radar transmitters, the coupled cavity circuit has gained the ascendancy. Recent advances have been stimulated and supported by the ever increasing needs of electronic countermeasures (ECM) where average power and bandwidth are of critical importance. For airborne systems where the limitations on weight and size are stringent, periodic magnetic focusing has been utilized along with special gridded electron guns which make possible simple modulation circuits. Although relatively few TWT's have been manufactured in large quantitites, there are many refined prototypes covering the frequency range from L band through Ku band at power levels of from a few hundred watts to several hundred kilowatts. Very impressive life data have now been accumulated for the TWT amplifiers currently operating in all of the communication space satellites. Although this particular application is less than 10 years old, there are hundreds of TWT's continuously transmitting in orbit today. Significant advances have been recently achieved in the maximum obtainable efficiency from a TWT designed for system use. With careful design of the electron optics and the employment of velocity tapering, efficiencies in excess of 50 percent are quite common in a practical transmitter operating in the X-band region. Broad-band dual-mode tubes are now in the development stage which permit efficient operation at two different power levels separated by as much as 7 dB. Such versatility is quite important to modern airborne countermeasure techniques. In the foreseeable future, the total TWT market will likely remain constant at the 80-million dollar level in spite of the continued erosion of the present tube applications caused by solid-state microwave devices. As power levels increase and the higher frequency bands become more popular, TWT's will remain unchallenged in many situations. No dramatic breakthroughs are predicted for this mature technology, but there will be increasing emphasis on life, reliability, and cost."
"High-power klystrons, coupled-cavity traveling-wave tubes (TWT's), and hybrid tubes, all of which utilize the microwave cavity as the basic circuit element, are described. These amplifiers are used in communications, radars, electronic countermeasures, and other applications at power levels from a few hundred watts to megawatts, at frequencies from ultrahigh frequency on up, and are particularly suited for high average powers. High gain, 30 to 60 dB, is normally achieved, and bandwidth usually lies in the 1-30-percent range. Elementary theory of operation is described, together with design considerations and systems interface information. Typical tube designs and data are presented. Recent developments are discussed, including high-efficiency techniques (to 75 percent), improvements in bandwidth, periodic focusing, and beam control electrodes. Most of the basic design techniques are well developed, and emphasis is being shifted to improvements in the detailed performance characteristics such as gain and phase resolution ripples, noise, and the sensitivities to operating voltages and currents."
"The crossed-field amplifier (CFA) is an outgrowth of the magnetron. Several varieties exist including the forward-wave/ backward-wave types, and the injected-beam continuous-cathode (emitting-sole) types. Of these, the continuous-cathode type has found the most usage and has been established in many systems. Emphasis is placed upon this type. The CFA interaction process has similarities to a synchronous generator. From this, many of the characteristic features can be deduced or understood. The size, efficiency, range of performance, phase stability, and operating parameters are a feature of the crossed-field interaction process which distinguishes the CFA from other microwave tubes. Its greatest usage is in light-weight transportable radar systens, although not restricted to these. Its future lies in the extension of its gain capability and in the incorporation of technological advances such as new materials."
"The technology described in this paper is intended to update the reader about the last decade of research and development in the field of high-power gridded tubes. Lower power level tubes are also discussed to serve as a foundation for the high-power tubes because they are generally used for drive stages. Special emphasis is placed on the development of a new generation of high-power gain-high frequency linear tubes for the broadcast industry. The new generation of linear tetrodes described operates at CW power levels up to 25 kW and meet two-tone single-sideband limits of better than -40 dB for third-order distortion products and better than -45 dB for fifth-order distortion products. These tetrodes perform in the 225-400-MHz military band and because of the good linearity are used in the new generation VHF television transmitters being introduced in the USA. Methods of designing circuits are discussed. Recently developed tetrodes operating at power levels up to 500 kW at power gains of 25-27 dB at 1 MHz are also described. Likewise, circuit approaches are detailed. The magnetically beamed triode tubes introduced in 1964 for modulator and low-frequency applications are described. These tubes provided a threefold breakthrough in high power, high power gain, and good tube efficiency. This approach reduced the conventional triode grid current by a factor of 10-15. Introduction to distributed amplifiers (DA) and the development of a 75-kW tube operating in a 1.6-MW distributed amplifier at 8-40 MHz is described. Included is the scaling of a 500-W distributed amplifier tube to a 75-kW tube. Development of gridded tubes for multi-megawatt phased array applications is included. An amplifier chain having a gain of 40 dB would cost approximately 4750 dollars as detailed in a 1967 study. A mean time to failure (MTTF) of 40 000 h is demonstrated. Gridded tubes and circuits operating at peak power levels up to 5 MW at frequencies up to 450 MHz are described. The major advance in this area has been the application and refinement of circuits used with high-power gridded tubes. The life of these tubes in high-power RF service continues to improve. Typical life is in the order of 10 000 to 40 000 h. Projections for the life of gridded tubes using various cathodes is made. In a well-designed stable system, the gridded tube life (and possibly other tubes) is approximately one half the theoretical life of the cathode. In the case of thoriated tungsten, the theoretical life approaches 80 000 h and likewise the MTTF approaches 40 000 h. The development of a 1.25-MW Coaxitron is discussed. The Coaxitron features the integration of the broad-band circuit components along with the gridded optics into one common vacuum envelope. The tube weighs approximately 135 lb, operates in the 400-450- MHz range, has 0.15°/1-percent RF phase sensitivity to plate voltage change, has 1.3°/1-dB RF phase sensitivity to RF drive power change, has a power gain of approximately 17 (without integral drive stage), can stand shock of 15g for an 11-ms pulse and is capable of vibration up to 500 Hz at approximately 2g."

The pulse shielding effectiveness of many different shielding materials, both ferrous and nonferrous, is analyzed. The material costs and weights are compared. It is shown that below a certain pulse current level, nickel-iron alloys produce the lightest shields. Above that current level, nonferrous materials become lighter because they are less dense. Suggestions for the improvement of ferrous alloys are included."

"The mathematical equivalence between a potential satisfying a deterministic Laplace-type equation within a closed region and a certain probability associated with a particle exercising Brownian motion is described. Two methods are outlined for obtaining a potential by Brownian motion, the usual Monte Carlo method and a \"number-diffusion\" process. Two probabilistic solutions of Poisson's equation are described. The number-diffusion process with complex diffusion coefficients is applied to a lumped linear electrical network under sinusoidal excitation, for computation of complex voltages. The node equations of a general network are interpreted probabilistically for transient behavior, and computations for a particular case verify the theory. The computation efficiencies (as measured by computing time) of both Monte Carlo and number-diffusion calculations of a potential are compared to the efficiency of matrix manipulation. It is shown how the probabilistic computations at sparse space-time points on a grid of a large number of points in two or three space dimensions may require orders of magnitude less time than for matrix solution, as well as less storage space. Probabilistic solutions of the wave equation for a finite lossy transmission line sinusoidally excited are shown to converge accurately only if |1 + ½(γΔx)2| > 1 (exp ± γx spacial variation of the natural waves). Then the numerical convergence of the number-diffusion algorithm is examined for various equations and sufficient conditions derived for that convergence."

In the past three years, bit density has increased a thousandfold, from 2000 bits/in2to 2 million bits/in2. Drive field requirements and sensor efficiency have remained nearly constant. A unified theory of device design is only now beginning to appear, but experimental evidence so far suggests that devices with submicron bubbles and 100 million bits/in2are only a matter of time."
"Using the definition that the most efficient use of the radio-frequency spectrum is that which produces maximum communication with a point or into and through an area, it is shown that considerable bandwidth expansion is required to achieve optimum communication capacity. The effectiveness of digital modulation in trading bandwidth for interference protection is demonstrated in the environment of a dense urban network. The considerable benefits obtained from the use of highly directive antennas with small off-angle response are demonstrated. Effects produced by reflection and scattering from objects on or near the radio path are studied parametrically. It is concluded that very large amounts of communication can be realized in a restricted area and bandwidth if bandwidth expanding digital modulation techniques are employed in combination with high-quality antennas mounted so as to minimize effects of the environment."

"Only when we learn to understand much better the dynamic interaction between new transportation systems and the structure of our communities can we take full advantage of transportation's potential as a really effective tool in our quest for a finer quality of life for our citizens. The opportunity to do so is much enhanced by the recent rapid evolution in transportation from its centuries-old pattern of unconstrained growth paced by key advances in propulsion and new rights of way to a new age of finesse in which automation will bring, from existing rights of way, higher capacity, greater safety, and far better service at lower cost through automated system and total-trip management. In parallel, the discipline that has helped us predict well the dynamic behavior of such mostly physical systems as air-traffic control may add some helpful insight into such critical questions as the long-range effects of transportation on urban structure, where nontechnological factors dominate. Leadership belongs to the communities; the federal role is to provide support in generic ways. It is hoped that new Department of Transportation programs in technology-and-planning-tool sharing and in university support will be helpful."
"In the past decade, automatic freeway surveillance and control systems have been introduced in several cities in the United States. Effective use of the hardware that has been implemented requires a sound mathematical basis for evaluation and optimization studies. In this paper, the nature of freeway congestion and the structure of systems which have been implemented to relieve this congestion are discussed. Mathematical models of freeway traffic which allow consideration of on-ramp metering control are developed. Finally, several freeway traffic-control problems are discussed, current approaches are described, and formulations of improved (optimal) approaches are developed."
"Two basic data processing problems associated with freeway traffic are formulated: estimation of traffic variables (section mean speed and density) and detection of occurrence of an incident or accident within a given section of the road. The existing traffic sensors and the current estimation techniques and their shortcomings are reviewed. Stochastic models for traffic variables are developed and used to design optimum recursive estimators. The incident detection problem is introduced as a potential area where many interesting research topics exist."
"A complete surveillance and traffic control electronic system was designed and is being put into operation in a newly built urban tollway in Naples, Italy. In this system, named TANA after the tollway name (TAngenziale di NApoli), information is collected from several hundred loop detectors placed along the highway (on each lane every 250 m) and is relayed to a Central Control Room, where it is processed in real time by a digital computer. As a result, traffic conditions are continuously displayed to operators, and useful information is given to motorists through automatically steered variable-message signs, which on the tollway display conditions of traffic ahead, conditions of the roadway, state of traffic on the exit ramps, and outside the tollway, information on the state of entrance ramps and on the conditions of traffic in given sections of the tollway. Strategies for the automatic incident detection carried out by the system are described. The main purposes of TANA system are the achievement of maximum safety in critical points such as tunnels and entrance ramps (where access is controlled by means of automatically steered tunnel controllers and ramp controllers), the decrease in number and importance of multiple accidents, the optimization of traffic flow in the tollway and in the interchanges with the urban network, and the possibility for the users to take educated decisions based on the knowledge of traffic conditions. Safety features are assured even in case of a fault in the central computer or in the telecommunications system, by means of local analog devices, operating in standby."

It is concluded that there is considerable promise in these techniques and that obstacle detection, in particular, deserves much more attention than it appears to have received."
"Baseline specifications for a magnetically suspended vehicle capable of 300 mi/h (483 km/h) operation are given. The magnetic forces (lift, drag, and lateral) on a superconducting coil moving over an aluminum guideway are shown. The basic features of the associated cryogenics are presented along with a discussion of the cryogenic refrigeration requirements. Vehicle dynamics and the resultant ride quality over roadbeds of various roughnesses are analyzed. Thrust requirements for the propulsion system are specified, and both the linear induction motor and the linear synchronous motor are considered. Several guideway configurations are suggested and the significant properties of each are noted."
"Theoretical analyses are carried out on a magnetic suspension and a linear synchronous motor, both utilizing superconducting magnets. The derived theory is applied to the studies of the high-speed train models. In the suspension system investigated here, the roadbed is equipped with normal conducting coils. The magnetic lift force is found to be pulsating, and a design criterion for eliminating the pulsation components in the lift force is derived. An improved suspension system is proposed, which consists of a \"ladder-type conductor\" in the roadbed. This new system is investigated theoretically. An end effect of the suspension system is also studied. In the linear synchronous motor, the methods of minimizing reaction forces are derived. The combined magnetic suspension and propulsion system is analyzed. It is found that the influence of the track loops for the suspension on the linear synchronous motor is not very significant."
"General relations and limitations pertinent to the design of an inductive magnetic suspension system are derived. It is shown that in order to reduce magnetic drag we must increase the vehicle field and decrease the guideway currents. But this then produces a stiff suspension unless we are willing to increase guideway cost. Reasonable and consistent design objectives are shown to be: vehicle natural frequency for heave≃1 Hz without secondary suspension; suspension power lossessime;10 kW/ton (L/D=120 at 270 mi/h); aluminum requirements≃80 kg/m for a dual guideway. It was shown to be theoretically possible to operate at arbitrarily low speeds by using either a superconducting guideway or a feedback control system for short distances near terminals. Between terminals the guideway might resemble a parallel-wire transmission line with a thin conducting sheet between the wires. The design of an active-guideway linear synchronous motor is discussed and shown to be capable of supplying 5 MW of power at efficiencies of about 85 percent and a power factor of 0.5. For a dual guideway the armature windings require about 40 kg/m of aluminum, but no steel. The total cost of the maglev portion of a 120 m/s (268 mi/h) high-speed ground transportation system is estimated to be about 1 million dollars/km, with at least half of this related to propulsion and power distribution and control. If speed is reduced to 90 m/s (202 mi/h), substantial economies are possible."
"The magnetic shielding required for magnetically levitated vehicles is discussed. Shielding is needed to protect passengers in a vehicle from stray dc magnetic fields coming from the superconducting dipoles carried by the vehicle. In addition, the superconducting dipoles must be shielded against various ac magnetic fields. Here we consider shielding of ac magnetic fields generated by the propulsion windings for the case of a linear-synchronous-motor active guideway. Protection for passengers against magnetic fields is necessary as there are at present no data upon which to base a human tolerance of magnetic-field intensity. It is shown here that in a magnetically levitated vehicle where the space to be shielded is large and where the weight of shielding is a prime concern, active shielding, in which compensation dipoles generate a canceling magnetic field, is superior to passive shielding, which uses iron plates. At the floor of the passenger cabin of a proposed vehicle, the magnetic field, without compensation, is as high as 0.03 T. Compensation dipoles, comparable in size to and placed 0.5 m above the main dipoles, increase the total conductor requirement by about ⅓ to bring the magnetic field at the floor of the passenger cabin below a level of 0.005 T. To achieve the same result by passive shielding, an iron plate or equivalent up to 2 cm thick must cover the floor of the passenger cabin, resulting in at least a 10 000-kg increase in the total weight for a 100-passenger vehicle. We therefore strongly recommend active shielding. At 100 Hz, a peak ac field of more than 10-5T cannot be tolerated in the superconducting dipoles of a vehicle as hysteresis and eddy-current losses within the conductor become excessive. The ac field reaching the main dipoles from the propulsion windings in the guideway can be as high as 10-3T without shielding. An aluminum sheet of 2-mm thickness kept at 4.2 K attenuates the field and makes ac superconductor losses negligible while keeping the eddy-current losses in the sheet to an acceptable level."
"A preliminary investigation has been made of the potentialities of a high-speed low-loss transportation which could be competitive with the air-transport system. This system, called the MEL (magnetic-suspension, evacuated-tube, linear-motor-propulsion) system, employs passenger-carrying vehicles vertically supported by permanent magnets and laterally stabilized by an electro-magnetic servosystem, with no physical contact between vehicle and surroundings. Aerodynamic drag is reduced by two orders of magnitude (compared to operation in open atmosphere) by evacuation of the subterranean tube in which the vehicle travels. Expected magnetic drag at 270 m/s (600 mi/h) is small compared to aerodynamic drag. Stable contactless suspension was achieved with a model, but track length limited testing to low speeds. A linear motor is used for propulsion in the proposed system; since the low drag permits extensive coasting, only a small fraction of the track-mounted primary requires energization. Assuming magnetic drag negligible compared to aerodynamic drag at 270 m/s, a 1-percent reduction in coasting velocity would occur in approximately 85 km. The ultimate speed of this system will probably be determined by ground stability, track linearization economics, and suspension stabilization design. The combination of constant temperature, absence of frost heaving and other weather effects, and the existence of a uniform low pressure when the vehicle passes should permit far greater track stability than that obtained with a wheeled high-speed surface train. The MEL-system vehicle is assumed to attain a cruise speed of 270 m/s for calculating the economic potentiality of the system. The required track straightness for this speed is discussed This system should exhibit superiority over the air-transport system in air and sound pollution, conservation of energy resources fare economy, safety and reliability, potential passenger capability probable ultimate speed without sonic boom problems, and several other factors. The air-transport system is superior in capability of serving low-traffic-density areas and overseas routes, flexibility in circumventing equipment failures, and susceptibility to earthquakes. The major expense item for the operator of the MEL system is amortization of construction cost, but anticipated annual revenues for a New York, N. Y.-Los Angeles, Calif. route in the 1980's far exceed this cost."
"The ROMAG®system of magnetically guiding and propelling vehicles using ordinary-temperature linear electric motors which combine levitation, thrust, guidance, and dynamic active suspension to achieve a high ratio of payload to vehicle weight is described.

In this system, 3-phase, 60-Hz, 8250-V wayside power is converted by a solid-state power conditioning unit to a variable-voltage variable-frequency output suitable for use by linear-induction motors that provide up to 66 600-N (15 000-lb) propulsive thrust to the vehicle at 480 km/h (300 mi/h). The system provides continuously variable thrust during forward- and reverse-thrust modes, and such special features as automatic start-up, regenerative braking, and automatic failure/malfunction detection and shutdown. The system incorporates high-voltage water-cooled components for high specific thrust (more than 5 N/kgf, or 0.5 lbf thrust/lbf weight)."
"Linear induction motors being proposed for high-speed ground transportation may have their primaries carried on board the vehicle or embedded in the guideway. This paper evaluates various aspects, such as power requirements, power switching and controls, utilization factor, efficiency and cost, etc., for these two alternatives and provides the basic format on which relative merits of various systems can be readily evaluated. The analysis shows that, in the fixed primary system, it is economically impractical to energize sections of the roadbed substantially longer than the vehicle. Even when the primaries in the roadbed are energized in sections of minimum length, the cost of the linear induction motor and additional switching and power network for the fixed primary system is an order of magnitude higher than that for the moving primary system."
"A realistic mathematical model of the single-sided linear induction motor (SLIM) is presented. Using this model, propulsion and levitation forces are computed for a SLIM with back iron. The validity of the analysis is verified by tests on a laboratory model. Some associated problems are outlined, and the feasibility of SLIM's for high-speed ground transportation (HSGT) is discussed. With regard to HSGT, SLIM is compared with the double-sided linear induction motor."
"SYNCHROTRAC is a power control system that provides longitudinal control of vehicles by a unique method in which it distributes power to those vehicles. The vehicles are passive (control-wise) in that power modulation is accomplished by the vehicle's position within the traveling control section. Therefore, no on-board power modulation or communication equipment is required. The SYNCHROTRAC system can be readily employed in a wide variety of transportation applications. It is adaptable to the closed-circuit moving sidewalk applications that require slow captive vehicles operating with small headways as well as to the independently routable dual-mode application that requires fast vehicles operating with small headways. The specific vehicle design can vary to suit a particular application requiring only that the motive drive be an induction motor providing the appropriate vehicle dynamic response, i.e., voltage and frequency versus torque."
"An approach to the analysis of linear motors, based on the Fitzgerald superpotential is outlined. The usefulness of the approach is demonstrated in calculations of the fields, the streamline pattern, and the performance characteristics of some versions of the linear motor. Analysis of the streamline pattern brings out, in turn, the influence of the end effects."

"A general formula for the Hilbert transform of a product of complex-valued functions is developed. Certain simplifications are then exhibited for products often encountered in the context of modulation and signal processing. The approach chosen is one of frequency partitioning; this permits signal definition on complementary sections of the frequency axis and leads to compact and easily manipulated expressions."

"The low-frequency open circuit noise spectral density S(f) of an ion-implanted 60-GHz double-drift-region IMPATT diode was measured as a function of the dc avalanche current I0. Over an intermediate current range the noise follows an S(f)=a2VB02/I0relationship where VB0is the reverse breakdown voltage and a2≃4.5 × 10-20A/Hz."
 "A modified version of the generalized discrete transform described earlier is now developed. The transform matrix of this modified version has a number of zeros as its elements, and consequently its matrix factors are more sparse. This results in fewer arithmetic operations and corresponding savings in computer time, when information is processed."

"Two types of aftereffects were observed in testing IMPATT diodes under ionizing radiation. The first type can be characterized by a 10-25-percent decrease in power and a 5-20-MHz change in oscillation frequency after the radiation pulse. The second type is characterized by a large change in oscillator performance (3-dB decrease in power and 1-GHz change in frequency) or irreversible diode failure, and occurred with two GaAs Schottky diodes. A strong cavity-RF load dependence has been demonstrated for the latter type of aftereffect."
"Low-frequency noise characteristics of a variety of commercially available X-band 500-W CW IMPATT diodes are reported. All the silicon diodes exhibited characteristics in agreement with previously published avalanche noise theory, while the gallium arsenide diodes exhibited an excess amount of low-frequency noise, multiple noise peaks with bias current, and a dynamic resistance that decreases with bias current."

"It is shown that in the case of a homogeneous and isotropic turbulence the knowledge of the temporal correlation function of the amplitude fluctuations on the laser beam axis allows the estimation of the spatial spectral density of the index of refraction. Under certain conditions this method may be used for atmospheric turbulent flow also, which represents in general a locally homogeneous and isotropic random field."

"The description of a scheme where all the excitation energy of a synchronous machine is derived from its output terminals through a potential transformer and a thyristor-controlled ac-to-dc converter is presented. The circuit is controlled by a strong feedback loop and performs the functions of both the conventional exciter and an automatic voltage regulator. The excitation energy is supplied in the form of dc voltage pulses of constant amplitude and variable width at constant frequency. The scheme is meant for isolated power supply and requires only a 12-V dry cell for triggering a pair of thyristors. Some experimental difficulties are also discussed."
"The basic concept of an n-variable universal logic module (ULM-n) as developed by Yau and Tang is extended so that the input control functions are simple two-bit binary codes and not determined by one of the n variables. Although the resulting design is not a minimum pin configuration, it has the advantage that the control variables are 0 and 1. Basic ULM-2 and ULM-3 are developed and a method of using them to implement higher variable ULM's is also considered."

"In many digital signal precessing systems, e.g., vacoders, modulation systems, and digital waveform coding systems, it is necessary to alter the sampling rate of a digital signal Thus it is of considerable interest to examine the problem of interpolation of bandlimited signals from the viewpoint of digital signal processing. A frequency dmnain interpretation of the interpolation process, through which it is clear that interpolation is fundamentally a linear filtering process, is presented, An examination of the relative merits of finite duration impulse response (FIR) and infinite duration impulse response (IIR) digital filters as interpolation filters indicates that FIR filters are generally to be preferred for interpolation. It is shown that linear interpolation and classical polynomial interpolation correspond to the use of the FIR interpolation filter. The use of classical interpolation methods in signal processing applications is illustrated by a discussion of FIR interpolation filters derived from the Lagrange interpolation formula. The limitations of these filters lead us to a consideration of optimum FIR filters for interpolation that can be designed using linear programming techniques. Examples are presented to illustrate the significant improvements that are obtained using the optimum filters."
"The following major interrelated aspects in digital communications are described: source encoding, channel encoding and transmission, and receiver methods. Methods for digitizing speech and video are summarized. Digitized voice can be transmitted at 10 kb/s, while phone video requires 1.544 Mb/s. The major aspects of both forward-error control (FEC) and automatic request for repeats (ARQ) are considered. Power-limited forward channels are distinguished from bandwidth-limited ones. Signal distance concepts and maximum-likelihood detection principles provide the framework for describing both block-coded and convolutional-coded signaling. Convolutional coding with Viterbi decoding appears to achieve the most cost-effective forward-error control. The improved FEC techniques benefit the transmission of real-time digitized voice and video and any communication over severely power-llmited links. ARQ methods continue to be effective and practical for most cases where the delay associated with retransmission can be tolerated."
"A survey of associative processing, techniques is presented, together with a guide to the published literature in this field. Some familiarity with the basic concepts of associative-processing is assumed. The references have been divided into four groups dealing with architectural concepts, hardware implementation, software considerations, and application areas. The discussion of architectural concepts consists of a classification of associative devices into four major categories (fully parallel, bit-serial, word-serial, and block-oriented) and an enumeration of techniques for dealing with multiple responses and hardware faults. With respect to hardware implementation, considerations are given to the basic operations implemented, hardware elements used (e.g., cryoelectrics, magnetic elements, and semiconductors), and physical characteristics such as speed, size, and cost. The discussion of software aspects of associative devices deals with synthesis of algorithms, programming problems, and software simulation. The application areas discussed include solution of some mathematical systems, radar signal processing, information storage and retrieval, and performance of certain control functions in computer systems."
"Various forms of CO2lasers have achieved CW powers in the 60-kW range, operating efficiencies approaching 30 percent, pulse energies of approximately 2000 J, pulsewidths less than 1 ns, peak pulse powers in excess of 109W, a frequency stability of a few parts in 1012, and sealed-off tube lifetimes of many thousands of hours. In addition, the laser can be easily Q-switched as well as gain-switched and has been electrically, optically, gas-dynamically, and chemically pumped. In addition to all these attributes, the CO2laser output wavelength lies within one of the best atmospheric windows. It should be no surprise then that during the last eight years, the CO2laser has firmly established itself as a candidate for recognition as the most important among the numerous laser devices presently known. Depending on the gas pressure, gas flow rate, pumping mechanisms, gas mixture, etc., CO2lasers can exhibit a wide range of noise, bandwidth, gain, and power saturation characteristics. This flexibility enables a designer to optimize the performance of CO2laser stable-frequency master oscillators; power oscillators; low-noise high-gain preamplifiers; intermediate-power or high-power amplifiers. As a result, CO2laser oscillator-amplifier chains can be designed utilizing guidelines similar to those which have been extensively applied in the design of transmitters in the RF and microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum."
"An adaptive array that rejects undesired or interfering signals is presented. The array pattern is controlled by an adaptive feedback system based on a steepest descent minimization of mean-square error. Error is defined as the difference between the array output and a locally generated reference signal. Minimization of mean-square error is closely related to maximization of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A two-element adaptive array has been built, and its experimental performance is discussed. Typical patterns for various desired and interfering signals are shown, as well as measured transient response. Finally, some experiments showing the array behavior with modulated signals are described. The results show that such an antenna system is capable of automatically rejecting interfering signals, subject only to certain basic constraints. No a priori information about the angles of arrival of the signals is required, Detailed knowledge of the waveforms of the desired and interfering signals is also not needed, although the spectral characteristics of the desired signal must be known."
"The basic phenomena involved in double-pumped phosphors with energy transfer are described and discussed.

"A specific form of a recently proposed algorithm is derived for the rapid determination of the steady-state response of large classes of piecewise-linear systems subjected to periodic inputs. It can be directly incorporated at marginal cost into a computer-oriented state space approach for generating the time domain response of such systems. The algorithm has been successfully applied to several circuits."
"An approach is suggested for studying the transient behavior of a transistor-tunnel diode hybrid combination with resistive feedback which shows an improved switching speed. The method uses the charge-control model for the transistor and empirical power functions for the tunnel diode. Experimental observations with tunnel diode in combination with slow and gold-doped switching transistors demonstrate that the models used in the analysis are satisfactory for engineering calculations."
"It is pointed out that the Q of n identical cascaded resonators, Qn, is related to that of each resonator Q0, by the exact relation Qn/Q0= (21/n- 1)-1/2, which is no more complicated than the approximations developed by Mitra and Huey."
"An n-bit parallel full adder and a full subtractor employing Gnnn-effect devices are proposed. The important feature is a high-speed carry generator utilizing transverse spreading of high field domains, whose operation is confirmed by computer study. The delay time of these circuits will be reduced to several hundred picoseconds."
"An extension of the Shockley-Read expression for steady-state lifetime is proposed for inhomogeneous nondegenerate semiconductors under a nonuniform external generation Gn(Gp) of electrons (holes) and in the presence of current flow. The special case of small disturbances in carrier density for a semiconductor with local electrical neutrality is also considered."
"Epitaxially grown silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) monolithic integrated IMPATT oscillators were fabricated and tested. One diode was successfully operated under pulsed conditions yielding 10-mW peak power output at 13.8 GHz. This experiment serves to demonstrate the feasibility of silicon-on-sapphire monolithic integration at microwave frequencies."

"Present-day display technologies, both exploratory and in common use, are reviewed in outline form with emphasis on areas of applicability, advantages, and disadvantages. The comments reflect the authors' own bias, but the basic ideas probably reflect the thinking of most of the members of the display community."
"Nematic liquid crystals are being used in a variety of display devices that capitalize on unique characteristics of these organic fluids. This paper discusses the purification and preparation of nematic liquid crystals, their operating temperature ranges, and the extent to which their properties meet the requirements of current dynamic-scattering and field-effect displays. While device performance can be further improved by tailoring the material, product acceptance will be principally determined by other factors such as reliability, packaging, and price reduction."
"The surface-generated orienting forces acting on liquid crystals (LC's) result from physicochemical processes, e.g., hydrogen bonding, Van der Waal's interactions, or dipolar interactions, and from mechanical interactions as a result of the LC's anisotropic elasticity. For flat, untextured surfaces, the physicochemical processes prevail, while for textured surfaces, the anisotropic elastic interactions must also be considered. These sometimes competing processes are compared quantitatively, and the various orienting techniques and materials are discussed. It is shown that although both physicochemical and anisotropic elastic interactions are important, the former will typically predominate."
"A numerical display cell (nine digits of seven segments) with nematic liquid crystals can be driven in a dynamic or a static mode. The static mode combines a flicker-free display with optimum contrast, but it has the drawback of a large number of interconnections (63). This paper describes a method to reduce this number to only four: a 63-b buffer memory in the form of an I2L shift register is attached directly to the glass plate carrying the electrode pattern. The required transparent electrode patterns provided with metallized contacts are prepared by means of thin-film techniques."
"A new reflective-type electrophoretic image display (EPID) panel is described which is based on electrophoresis. In the EPID panel, a suspension is mainly composed of pigment particles and a suspending liquid. A dc voltage applied across a suspension layer changes the reflective color of the suspension as a result of the electrophoretic migration of the particles. The precipitation of the particles in the suspension is prevented by making the densities of the pigment particles and the suspending liquid equal. Color combinations of both the pigment particles and the suspending liquid can be used to achieve a desired color display. A reversal between the colors of the displayed pattern and its background can be obtained by changing the polarities of the applied dc voltage. The EPID panel has a memory function because of the deposition of the pigment particles on the electrode surface. A reflective contrast ratio of 40:1 at 75 V dc is demonstrated with experimental EPID panels. Rise and fall times of the panels are 20 ms and 10 ms, respectively, at 100 V ac. Power dissipation of the panel is about 7.5 mW for displaying a numeral \"8\" (107 by 59 mm2)."
"A thorough investigation of human color vision and vectorial color space is linked to chemicophysical properties of electroluminescent (EL) solids. Three separate cases are discussed: a single color, several discriminable colors, and full-color-gamut EL displays. A review of chromaticness discrimination, chromatic abberation, color vision abnormalities, and color naming experiments indicates that the preferred monochromatic colors for solid-state displays are 590 nm yellow, 620 nm red, 480 nm blue, and their mixtures. Green is found least suitable under white ambient viewing and should be below 500 nm. It is concluded that while no present commercial material satisfies optimal criteria for any of the three cases, several materials offer a reasonable promise to satisfy the first case, and in part, the second. The long-range prospects of the third case are estimated. Past, present, and future state of the art of electro-luminous yields of the more prominent crystals are analyzed and projected. The future of research and technology throughout the next 25 years is forecast. There seem to be no fundamental obstacles to a significant growth rate of EL displays throughout the rest of this century."
"The growth and performance of vapor phase epitaxial (VPE) III-V materials and devices for light-emitting diode (LED) and display applications are reviewed. Because of the commercial importance of the GaAsP ternary alloys and GaP, this paper is primarily concerned with these materials. With the addition of nitrogen doping high-performance red, yellow, and green devices can be fabricated using GaAsP and GaP. The VPE materials growth technology is highly developed, and, in conjunction with the Zn diffusion techniques used to form the p-n junctions, is compatible with planar processing procedures similar to those commonly used in the Si integrated-circuit industry. This processing technology results in reproducible and economical LED devices. In this paper the performance of VPE GaAsP devices is compared with the performance of other types of LED's, and economic considerations involved in the fabrication of LED devices are discussed."
"Green and yellow emitting diodes can be made in nitrogen-doped gallium phosphide by a simple vapor-growth and diffusion process. The color is controlled by the nitrogen concentration, and bright yellow emission is made possible at room temperatures by the high nitrogen concentrations attainable in the vapor-growth process. As there are no problems of mismatch and strain in the homoepitaxial growth process, epitaxial layers can be thin and diffusion is straightforward. Typical yellow encapsulated diode efficiencies are around 0.05 percent, best results being 0.1 percent. The transparency of the substrate to the yellow emission allows diodes to be inverted, the improved heat sinking of the devices then permitting high current densities and very high brightnesses. Both green and yellow monolithic array structures can be made by localized diffusion techniques. Optical crosstalk is appreciable in the yellow emitting arrays and appropriate designs are required to improve contrast. Device life is evidently long at current densities in the range 1-100 A/cm2, and no catastrophic degradation is seen even at current densities in excess of 103A/cm2."
"A method named synthesis, solute diffusion (SSD) has been developed for growing compound semiconductor crystals, GaP in particular, for light-emitting diode (LED) use. The grown crystal is cylindrically shaped and is composed of fairly large-size grains. Growth rate is limited by the diffusion process of phosphorus in the gallium melt. The diffusion coefficient was obtained from the growth rate and found to be 8×10-5cm2s-1at 1100°C with an activation energy of 0.65 eV. Donor impurities, tellurium or sulfur, can be reproducibly incorporated from 3×1017to 4×1018cm-3, with segregation coefficients at 1150°C, 0.038 and 1.0, respectively. The quality of the grown crystals was observed to be exceptionally good, and the saucer-type pits were hardly observable in the crystal on modified AB etching. Highly efficient red-light-emitting junctions were reproducibly grown by only one single-layer-single-liquid-epitaxy process, in which zinc was doped from the vapor phase. A double-layer-single-epitaxy process, which we call \"liquid epitaxial grown-in junction\" process, was also developed and it produced highly efficient green LED's. The LED's grown on the SSD wafers have efficiencies up to 7.4 percent for red and 0.15 percent for green."
"Progress in the fabrication of monolithic matrix-addressed arrays of light-emitting diodes (LED's) in GaP using selective liquid-phase epitaxy is reviewed. The structures of two red arrays and one green array are discussed in detail. Photographs of the arrays are shown to demonstrate their capability as alphanumeric displays which may be easily interfaced with silicon integrated circuits. The use of selective liquid-phase epitaxy (LPE) to make flip-chip bonded displays is also discussed."
"A review of the properties of electroluminescent phosphors of the zinc sulfide family is presented. In the past, these phosphors found few device applications because of material limitations that resulted in inadequate brightness and poor life as well as drive problems. The properties of two particular configurations are discussed in detail: ac-excited evaporated films of Zns:Mn and dc-excited powder layers of ZnS:Mn, Cu. These configurations exhibit such properties as high efficiency, low-duty-cycle operation, high contrast, high discrimination ratio, and acceptable operating lifetimes. In addition, the basic technology can result in inexpensive and rugged devices, which may be fabricated in unlimited symbol configurations and in a wide range of sizes. It is concluded that such technology offers potential advantages to display systems and should be considered viable candidates to satisfy future display requirements, especially in cases where cost effectiveness and ruggedness are overriding restrictions."
"A review is made of the characteristics of direct-current electroluminescent (dc EL) displays based on powders of zinc sulfide doped with manganese and copper. These panels show yellow emission with efficiency of about 0.1 percent watt per watt and can be operated under both continuous and pulsed operation. The preparation of the panels is described and the brightness-voltage-current relationships are given. Under continuous operation, the brightness at 100 V falls from 100 fL to 50 fL in several thousand hours, while under pulsed operation little deterioration is noted in this time. So far, 36-character (each consisting of 35 dots) displays have been prepared. It is suggested that a large variety of useful displays, both analog and digital, or combinations of these, can be produced dc EL panels based on zinc sulphide."
"The preparation and properties of direct current electroluminescent (dc EL) materials using manganese-activated ZnS powders for a flat-panel TV display are described. The firing process, the copper coating process, and the ferming process have been investigated. Suitable powder phosphors for the display panel contain 0.1-0.5 wt % manganese and 0.25-0.35 wt % copper coated on the ZnS powder surface. Although the powder-type dc EL still has low luminous efficiency, the light output can be increased to a useful level by exciting the panel with voltage pulses of high peak power. The crosstalk effect in the display panel can also be suppressed, since the brightness is very nonlinear with respect to the applied voltage. The sealing of the panel with silicone oil is effective in lengthening the life of the panel. An experimental dc EL panel with a 13-in diagonal and 50 176 picture elements has been fabricated, capable of reproducing broadcast TV images. These images have a highlight brightness of 10 fL, a contrast ratio of 20:1, a limiting resolution of about 150 TV lines in both horizontal and vertical directions, and a gray-scale capability of 16 steps."
"Principles and applications of phosphors in cathode-ray tubes are discussed. Among the basic parameters covered are: back-scattering, secondary emission, penetration, electronic transitions, dead voltage and energy, and optical efficiencies. Various relevant aspects of television kinescopes are discussed, including commercially used phosphor characteristics and screening techniques, radar tubes, image tubes, voltage-dependent color displays, flying-spot and beam-indexing tubes, projection, printing, and infrared stimulation systems. Colorimetry and photometry, as applied to phosphors, are discussed, including the CIE and UCS systems."
"Recent advances in cathodochromic dark trace storage-display tubes are reviewed. Primary emphasis is placed on sodalite screen materials; their synthesis, physical properties, and light scattering characteristics are discussed in detail. An analysis of the distinct thermal and optical modes of coloration is presented, and the corresponding device constructions are described. Brief descriptions of a number of experimental systems that utilize cathodochromic storage tubes are also included."
"Following a brief outline of the main display applications of single-crystal ferroelectric light valves, two categories of ferroelectric materials are distinguished--materials operated above their Curie temperature, which are electrically monostable, and materials operated below it, which are electrically bistable. Typical examples are KD2PO4in the first category and Bi4Ti3O12, Gd2(MoO4)3, and 5PbO:3GeO2in the second; in each case an examination is made of the physical properties of the material and the specific problems raised by the reading and the addressing of the display device using this material. To date the best results for display applications have been obtained using a single-crystal ferroelectric of the first category, KD2PO4, operated just above its Curie temperature."
"The interaction of structure with optical and electrical properties in lanthanum-doped lead zirconate-titanate (PLZT) ceramics is complex. An interpretation is presented which shows the critical dependence of structure and, hence, properties on the state of polarization, the temperature, and the La content. To explain the behavior of PLZT ceramics two new concepts are presented: polymorphism and penferroelectricity. Polymorphism occurs when either electrical or mechanical ordering fields generate a hybrid crystal structure in which an individual grain attains a crystal structure dependent on its orientation with respect to the field. Penferro-electricity refers to the condition in which material is noncubic and polar but with such a low spontaneous polarization that no domains exist. The justification for applying these concepts to PLZT rests on the existing structural, optical, and dielectric data supplemented by new X-ray evidence and new data on the temperature dependence of optical and electrical properties. Emphasis is placed on materials with 65/35 Zr/Ti ratio and 6 < X ≤ 8 where X is the atom % La substituted for Pb. Analysis of existing data disclosed 1) a lack of X-ray evidence for the morphotropic boundary predicted by average remanent birefrigence and planar coupling and 2) a discrepancy in the position of the phase transition located by the Curie point and by planar coupling coefficient. The new X-ray, optical insertion loss, dielectric and piezo-electric data show conclusively that the phase equilibria in 65/35 PLZT depend strongly on the state of polarization. In thermally annealed ceramics a state of penferroelectricity exists between the cubic paraelectric state and the rhombohedral ferroelectric state. Rhombohedral ferroelectric material with 6 < X < 8 transforms to polymorphic material with very strong ferroelectric properties during poling. Because of the large crystal distortions which accompany poling, the optical transmission in the poled state is much reduced. This behavior is the basis for many of the useful device applications of PLZT in this compositional range."
"Certain compositions within the quaternary lead-lanthanum-titanate-zirconate (PLZT) system exhibit neither a \"true\" ferroelectric nor a \"true\" paraelectric behavior and are therefore best characterized as quasi-ferroelectric. The dielectric, hysteresis, and optical properties of quasi-ferroelectric PLZT ceramics have been investigated for the representative 9/65/35 composition which was prepared as a transparent ceramic by means of a two-stage sintering-densification process. The results of these studies suggest that the quasi-ferroelectric behavior of PLZT compositions between their Curie temperature and a transition temperature Tpis brought about by the existence of polar distorted microregions (polar short-range order). By applying an electric field a transition to a macroscopic ferroelectric (FE) state (polar long-range order) is enforced which is, however, not stable at zero field at T > Tp. This concept, which explains the experimental observations, is compared with the possibility of a FE to anti-FE phase transition at Tp. Attention is drawn to the quasi-static memory behavior of this type of material that can be realized by disconnecting the sample in its ON state from the voltage source and which might enlarge the scope of applications of quasi-ferroelectric PLZT ceramics."
"A projection display device for slow-scan graphics has been developed using the scattering properties of PLZT ferroelectric ceramics. The device consists of a ferroelectric-photoconductor sandwich in which a Cd1-xZnxS mixture is used as a photoconductive film. The composition of the film is controlled to provide peak photosensitive response at 441.6 nm, corresponding to the blue line from a He-Cd laser. Any image can be written into the device with a combination of steered laser beam (less than 1 mW) and electrically applied pulses, held for an indefinite time without sustaining power and erased electrically. Because of the properties of the photoconductive film, selective erase and simultaneous reading and writing are possible. The all-solid-state structure of the device combined with the scattering properties of the ceramic permit the device to be used as a slide in a conventional 35-mm projector."
"A theoretical model has been developed which is based upon the approximation that the multiple scattering from ferroelectric ceramics and other display media can be described in terms of geometrical optics. The model has been used to describe the scattering from PLZT, liquid crystals, and display screens and has agreed well with exprimental data. The scattering characteristics of several current display materials have been compared with regard to their use in wide-angle direct-view displays. The model has predicted the material parameters for new and more effective display materials. Measurements of a simulated new medium have shown close agreement with the predicted scattering characteristics."
"The technology of digital deflectors made significant progress in the past. The success of this development was primarily based on the advances made in the preparation of electrooptic materials. The selection criteria are described here for a material suitable for the particular application under consideration, and a survey is made of the most promising electrooptic materials, both solid state and liquid. The list of solid-state materials comprises representatives of the class of oxygen octahedra ferroelectrics, KDP isomorphs, and AB-type compounds. A section on Kerr liquids begins with considerations for the optimization of the molecular structure and gives experimental results on some newly synthesized materials. Further, the impurity conduction phenomena that are important to the technical performance are described in detail. The final section reviews the present state of digital deflector development."
"Projection display systems which use a scanned infra-red laser beam to thermally record graphic information on different media may offer a useful alternative to CRT and other display systems. Three different types of thermal-recording projection display systems are reviewed. Laser micromachining of thin bismuth film has proved to be a very simple and efficient way to obtain instant high-quality images which are also permanent. Variable amplitude light pulses produced by an intracavity modulated laser beam were used to write these images. With an average laser power of 20 mW, 8×10 mm2facsimile type continuous-tone images, with a resolution of 1300×2000 resolvable elements, were recorded in 4 s. Thermal writing on liquid crystals offers a unique and simple way to record and display high-quality high-resolution graphic images with the capabilities of fast total or local erase. A CW Nd:YA1G laser was used to write graphic and alphanumeric-type information on cholesteric and smectic-type liquid-crystal light valves. High quality black and white images with a resolution of 2000×2000 picture elements were recorded within 30×30 mm2of liquid-crystal cell frames. With 4 mW of laser power, images were recorded at a rate of 104resolvable elements per second. A contrast ratio of 7:1 was obtained with the cholesteric-type liquid-crystal light valve. The stored image was electrically erased in about 0.1 s. In smectic-type light valves, the contrast ratio was better than 10:1 and local erase was achieved by the application of an electric field while the laser beam locally heated the erased area."
"Sputter deposition techniques have been developed which yield directly usable films of transparent conductors and of photoconductors for display devices. These devices have been primarily light-valve structures incorporating a ferroelectric ceramic plate or a liquid-crystal layer as the control medium. The deposition techniques may be modified to allow deposition on a variety of substrates including thermally sensitive materials. Transparent electrodes of sputter-deposited In2-xSnxO3-y(ITO) have been deposited on PLZT ferroelectric ceramics, glasses, and other substrate materials. These ITO films have excellent adherence and are hard but may readily be polished and etched. The visible-light transmission is excellent and the absorption in the near infrared is controlled by the conductivity. Films of resistivity of 3 × 10-4Ω ċ cm have routinely been deposited on thermally stable substrates while film resistivity of 10-3Ω ċ cm may readily be obtained on thermally sensitive substrates. Sputter-deposited CdS, which has a peak photosensitivity near the 514.5-nm line of the Ar laser, has had a photoconductive gain of 4 × 103and a dark resistivity greater than 107Ω ċ cm. Similar sputter-deposition techniques have been used to fabricate device structures incorporating Cd1-xZnxS as the photoconductor. The Cd1-xZnxS composition has been varied to match film peak photosensitivity with laser emissions between 400 and 500 nm. These films have not been as photosensitive as CdS but they permit greater visible-light transmission, are sufficiently insensitive to projecting light sources so that they may be used in simultaneous read-write systems, and are capable of being used in real-time display systems. The dark resistivity of Cd1-xZnxS is dependent on composition but has exceeded 1012Ω ċ cm in all films."
"Some aspects of the gas discharges in multicolor displays are discussed. The different techniques for generating visible radiation are mentioned. It is shown that the intrinsic luminous efficiency of a gas discharge is greatly reduced in real display panels by virtue of a number of factors, which are calculated. It appears that the positive column discharge in a gas mixture of argon and mercury vapor gives the highest luminous efficiency. Means of improving the luminous efficiency are indicated. A display with positive column discharges, as used in experiments, is described. The voltage and light output of a pulsed discharge are discussed."
"A gas-discharge flat-panel display device has been constructed in which the light output is white and the color is independent of intensity. The device is based on the Burroughs Self-Scan®structure. A white output was obtained by combining the orange glow of a gas mixture which is predominantly neon with the green emission of a ZnO:Zn phosphor (P15) deposited on transparent conducting anodes and excited by incident low-energy electrons. A peak spot intensity of 3000 fL in the white was achieved at a display-cell current density of 0.33 Aċcm-2and 180 V across the display cell. In a control region where no phosphor was deposited and the output was orange, the peak spot brightness was 7500 fL. Experiments on single-cell devices using helium, neon, argon, and xenon are described which demonstrate that the phosphor is indeed excited by low-energy electrons rather than by UV radiation from the gas discharge. The latter method had been used exclusively to date to obtain colors other than orange in gas-discharge flat-panel displays."
"Results obtained on an exploratory optically read ferroelectric-photoconductor storage device that utilizes the optical activity of domains in a lead-germanate crystal are reported. The device has been fabricated and tested, and good resolution and contrast were obtained. The major weakness of the device is its relatively low optical readout efficiency."
"The hologram matrix, which is a more elementary quantity than a conventional microwave hologram and contains much more information, is defined. Its application to a microwave holographic radar is described. This radar determines the distance by the spatial distribution of the scattered wave and differs from all other radars which determine the distance by the lapse of time. Some promising results were obtained from the computer simulation of such a radar."
"Because they are conformal maps of applicable equations, and because of the geometric properties of those maps, Smith charts can be used to represent the complex-valued plots of the frequency response of both the open- and closed-loop gains of a single-input single-output system on the same graph, inside the unit circle. The plots thus obtained may be used, often better than polar plots or Nichols charts, in any classical frequency response design or analysis procedure of which the author is aware, and present many advantages."
"Identification of a major failure mechanism in stripe-geometry proton-bombarded double-heterojunction lasers is reported. This mechanism consists of the formation of localized \"dark lines\" in the optical cavity, coinciding with a decrease in light output. The dark lines are aligned in 〈100〉 crystallographic directions."
"High-efficiency pulsed power at X-band frequencies has been generated using back-to-back IMPATT/TRAPATT silicon devices fabricated by ion implantation. Typical peak power of 8-12 W at 20-29-percent efficiency has been consistently achieved in a coaxial cavity. The highest power level obtained to date was 15-W peak, 21.5-percent efficiency at 8.1 GHz."
"A distributed parameter delay line, with an electrically controlled delay time, was built and investigated. It uses the non-linear bias dependence of the dielectric constant of PZT ferroelectric ceramics. At room temperature, delay times of about 200 ns (at impedance level of 100 Ω) and variations of 10 percent with electric field were obtained."
"A variable-word-length minimum-redundant code is described. It has the advantages of both the Huffman and Shannon-Fano codes in that it reduces transmission time, storage space, translation table space, and encoding and decoding times."

"Thin sheets of resistive material are predicted to smooth out the dc electric-field profile in arbitrarily long epitaxial layers of n-type GaAs. It is argued that the effect on RF gain is to require a minimum device thickness to overcome the resistive layer losses."
"The theory of low-frequency generation noise in bulk field-effect devices is derived to include the effects of field-dependent carrier mobility in the channel. The results indicate reduced bias dependence of the noise prior to drain current saturation when compared to the low-field case, and predict an overall level decrease with decreasing temperature."
"A type of injection synchronized oscillator, having an additional arrangement for its gain control, has been studied and its locking performance has been compared to that of a phase-locked loop (PLL) incorporating passive filter networks having no limiting and finite high-frequency gain. Also presented are the experimental results in support of the conclusion."
"A tunnel transistor which can be easily obtained by the conventional silicon planar technology will be proposed. It promises fine control of electrical characteristics and high yield. The yield per one wafer in the wafer checking has amounted to 100 percent."
"We have examined the theories on the separate-medium space-charge convolver utilizing the normal component of the sonic induced electric field. We have found no contradictions among the theories. Actually, if one applies certain approximations, the expressions derived by Wang and Das can be reduced to that obtained by Yamanishi and Kawamura and by Kino et al. Limitations on the simplified expressions are self-evident in comparison with experiment."
"The statistical properties of the future of a Gaussian process when conditioned on its past are shown to be easily deduced from a minor extension of well-known formulas of optimum prediction theory. Inversely, a direct calculation of those properties leads to a derivation of the basic theorems of prediction theory."

"The basic operational highlights of CO2-N2gas-dynamic lasers (GDL's) are described. Features common to powerful gas lasers are indicated. A simplified model of the vibrational kinetics of the system is presented, and the importance of rapid expansion nozzles is shown from analytic solutions of the equations. A high-power pulsed GDL is described, along with estimations of power extraction. A closed-cycle laser is suggested, leading to a description of a photon generator/engine. Thermodynamic analysis of the closed-cycle laser illustrates in principle the possibility of direct conversion of laser energy to work."
"The physics and technology of acoustooptics are reviewed mainly from the standpoint of designing laser-beam deflection devices and their applications. The ultrasonic light diffraction theory in a form useful for device application is outlined, beginning with the well-known Raman-Nath equation and covering both normal and abnormal types of Bragg reflection. Various acoustooptic materials are evaluated on the basis of two main factors, i.e., acoustooptic figures of merit and acoustic attenuation, as well as availability and optical quality. Guidelines for the selection of materials are discussed in some detail, although they are still insufficient for the complete prediction of new suitable materials. Elements of the acoustooptic light deflector are presented, and the importance of the fabrication techniques is stressed. As examples of the performance characteristics of the deflector, those of TeO2[001] longitudinal-wave and [110] shear-wave deflectors are described. Applications of the deflector to several kinds of apparatus and systems are considered on the basis of the present and the future states of the art."
"In the development of network theory over the years, the primary focus of attention has been in the area of linear systems. Several reasons for this emphasis can easily be cited, but perhaps the foremost reason is that it has long been thought that, except in certain very special cases, little progress toward a rigorous definitive theory could be expected once the hypothesis of linearity is discarded. The recent success in the use of numerical methods for computing solutions of the equations for specific nonlinear networks (the importance of which is not to be minimized) has, furthermore, resulted in a certain complacency on the part of many engineers who occasionally need to solve network problems. One senses their outlook as being, basically, that whenever a particular nonlinear problem arises, one need only then run, data in hand, to the computer. Somewhat ironically, however, the development of computer-aided network analysis techniques has also been a prime impetus for many of the recent theoretical investigations in the field of nonlinear networks, and although much remains to be done, a rather comprehensive body of knowledge in this area has begun to take form. A number of related recent contributions to the theory of non-linear networks are reviewed here. As distinct from the computational aspects of the network analysis problem, we discuss work whose primary purpose is to yield an understanding of the nature of the equations that describe the behavior of nonlinear networks, and to identify and relate certain properties of the network elements, and the manner of their interconnection, to properties of the equations and their solutions. In addition, we do frequently touch on the problem of computation since, as has already been implied, it is indeed one of the purposes of the work discussed here to provide more of a theoretical foundation on which to base the numerical analyses."
"This paper is a review of vacuum-arc phenomena which are related to switching devices. Despite the device overtones, the approach adopted for this paper is fundamental. Topics discussed include the drawn arc, the triggered arc, the power input to the cathode spot, cathode-spot division, arc stability, substructure of the cathode spot, dielectric recovery processes, and breakdown between electrodes subjected to repeated arcing. Frequent reference to the recent literature is made. Due to the somewhat specialized nature of certain parts of the discussion, introductory and appended sections of the paper present supplementary remarks on the concept of plasma and electrical conduction in gases, electron emission processes, and electrical contact phenomena."
"By considering the fluctuation of the starting time of domain formation and that of domain formation time, an expression for thermally induced FM noise in Gunn oscillators is derived. The result is in good agreement with experimental data. These results are applied to estimate thermally induced jitter in Gunn-effect digital devices."
"Two simple recursive formulas are derived for obtaining the coefficients of the partial fraction expansion with multiple poles. The entire process is pure algebraic operation without any differential calculus and is readily adapted to a digital computer."
"It is indicated that microwave holograms of twice the resolution capacity of conventional holograms can be formed by an extremely simple and convenient system in which the source acts as the receiver of the field scattered by the object."
"Operation of a solid-state active line using the plasma-coupled semiconductor device has been confirmed. The effective pulse propagation velocity in the line varies from 4×104cm/s to 1.9×105cm/s depending on the bias voltage. It is found that the active line also has several properties required to operate as a neuristor line."
"A multivibrator operation based on the plasma-coupled concept is described. A triggering voltage applied to an ohmic gate located between two negative resistance elements switches the \"on\" state from one element to the other. Astable, monostable, and bistable multivibrator operations have been achieved by varying several circuit parameters."

"In a buried-channel charge-coupled device (CCD), trapping effects at the interface states can be eliminated and high transfer efficiencies are thus obtained for a wide range of signal levels. Also, the noise associated with the interface states is eliminated. Therefore, good imaging can be achieved for light exposure levels several orders of magnitude smaller than the saturation level of the device. Experimental results obtained from a 500-element linear imaging device are described showing the potential of the device as a low light level imaging array."
"A class of digital feed-forward filters is developed, satisfying the requirement of a maximally flat stopband characteristic at zero frequency if the pulse-repetition frequency is modulated. A simple algorithm is given to obtain the filter coefficients. Some properties are summarized."

"An alternate development of a relaxation time for free charge in conducting media, presented in the referenced letter, is questioned here. It is shown that the equations of the alternate development actually lead to the well-known \"classical\" time constant ε/σ. Several instances of apparently questionable reasoning in the referenced letter are commented upon."
"The purpose of a field time constant regulator for a laboratory model synchronous machine is described. The design and test results described show that it is possible to adjust the field transient time constant over a range that is adequate enough to model synchronous machines over a very wide range of sizes."

"For single-output unity-gain requirements, Wilson's current-controlled current source (CCS) significantly improves upon the gain accuracy of the current mirror; however, this advantage is small in nonunity-gain applications. A novel CCS which preserves its gain accuracy under nonunity-gain multioutput service is presented here."
"Computational aspects of the image restoration schemes described by Sondhi are discussed. It is shown that severe numerical difficulties limit their direct use in practical applications."
"The surface layer of a newly manufactured vacuum switch with two-phase composition contacts, e.g., Cu+2-percent Bi or Cu+2-percent Te, exhibits a strong arc stability behavior, which tends to decrease with the erosion of the surface layer. In comparison, unalloyed metals, Cu or W, and single-phase compositions, Cu2Te, show a homogeneous arc stability behavior."
"The effect of the distributed nature of the shunt resistor in the distributed RC notch filter networks is investigated, and it is shown that the distributed capacitance associated with the shunt resistor can drastically shift the location of the optimum notch frequency."
"Based on the theory of partial coherence, a limit for the gain of a large antenna imposed by the randomness of fluctuating fields is obtained. There exists a region of gain saturation as the antenna reaches a dimension of 40 times the coherence length of fluctuating fields."
"A new circuit with tunnel diode and two delay lines of different time constants is described. Some peculiarities are noticed: 1) the self-oscillating range surpasses the negative-resistance portion of diode characteristics; 2) the period of pulses remains a rigorous constant; and 3) the circuit is free of hysteresis phenomenon."
"A new technique of using acoustic surface-wave filters for multiple UHF frequency generation has been demonstated. The 21 contiguous surface-wave filters, which are spaced 5.3 MHz apart from 520 to 650 MHz, occupy an area of 2 cm × 0.9 cm, and no multipliers or mixers are required."
"The drift-cum-diffusion mechanimn in the transistor base sets the ultimate speed of the transient response of its collector current when excited by an emitter-base step-function voltage. The response characteristics are calculated with reference to an analog RC transmission line and used to determine the frequency-domain response."
"An acoustic surface-wave matched filter which combines a planar ZnO overlay transducer to generate acoustic surface waves on silicon and a MOSFET array to detect the acoustic surface-wave energy has been developed, thus providing a signal-processing technique which will be compatible with MOS/LSI technology."
"The method of stationary phase (MSP), which is an asymptotic method of integration, nevertheless yields general (nonasymptotic) results when applied to certain integrals involving the spherical function. In such cases one may drop the requirement of far-field or high frequency from the results."

"More than 10 000 individual discrete sources have been detected by radio surveys made at frequencies from 10 MHz to 5 GHz. Although only a few hundred of these are reliably identified with galaxies or quasars, it is widely believed that the overwhelming majority are extragalactic. As a result of the rapid improvement in the sensitivity and the resolution of radio telescopes, the coordinates of many of the cataloged sources are being routinely measured with an accuracy of about 1\" and with special effort to a few tenths of a second of arc. Their angular structure is being mapped with a resolution of a few arc seconds by means of sophisticated multielement interferometer arrays; and for the very bright sources, tape recording interferometers with continental and intercontinental baselines give a resolution three or four orders of magnitude better. The form of the radio frequency spectra is known in some detail between 38 MHz and 10 GHz for hundreds of sources, and for a smaller number from 10 MHz to 100 GHz. Yet, in spite of the many exciting new observational results, or perhaps because of them, many more problems in understanding the extragalactic sources have arisen than have been answered by the more recent observations."
"Observations of the 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen give the best method for mapping the spiral structure of our galaxy, but there are still difficulties of interpretation. These arise from the need to infer the distance of any hydrogen concentration from its radial velocity, under circumstances where the velocity field and the structural pattern must both be derived from the same observations. The role of the density-wave theory of spiral structure is discussed. In addition to the mapping problem, this paper also considers the general properties of the galactic disk, the galactic center region, normal and high-velocity hydrogen clouds, and some aspects of hydrogen in other galaxies."
"Long-baseline interferometry achieves high resolution by using two or more widely separated radio telescopes and recording video signals on magnetic tapes, which are later brought together and cross-correlated. This paper contains discussions of the coherence and timing requirements and of calibration procedures. Applications to measuring brightness distributions and to spectroscopy are reviewed briefly. Some pertinent phenomena connected with radio-wave scattering in irregular media are discussed."
"Spectral-line radio astronomy has revealed over 50 molecular lines in the past four years. These lines correspond to 24 interstellar molecules, mostly organic, which are contained in dust clouds. Molecular clouds play an essential part in the evolutionary cycle taking place in our galaxy."
"The principal observed properties of pulsars and their theoretical interpretation are reviewed."
"Resolution for radio astronomy in the order of 1\" is necessary for the study of distant radio galaxies and quasars, for detecting faint sources, and for the mapping of clouds of hydrogen and other molecules. To obtain these resolutions many new or planned radio instruments use arrays of moderate size radio telescopes to synthesize large physical apertures. These instruments are generally composed of one or several linear arrays and utilize the rotation of the earth to change the relative orientation of the array and the radio source. The techniques used for earth-rotation aperture synthesis are discussed. The response of a two-element interferometer and the geometry associated with earth-rotation synthesis are reviewed; the current and proposed designs for these instruments and their performance are described; and, finally, the inversion methods for determining the angular power distribution of a radio source from the array response (visibility function) are outlined."
"A review is presented of the several methods which are available for the mapping of both reflectivity and topography of planetary surfaces by ground-based radar. Emphasis is placed on observational methods rather than interpretation of results. The various observational schemes are illustrated by recent observational results."
"Very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) techniques have already been used to determine the vector separations between antennas thousands of kilometers apart to within 2 m and the directions of extragalactic radio sources to 0.1\", and to track an artificial satellite of the earth and the Apollo Lunar Rover on the surface of the moon. The relative locations of the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package (ALSEP) transmitters on the lunar surface are being measured within 1 m, and the moon's libration is being measured to 1\" of selenocentric arc. Attempts are under way to measure the solar gravitational deflection of radio waves more accurately than previously possible, by means of VLBI. A wide variety of scientific problems is being attacked by VLBI techniques, which may soon be two orders of magnitude more accurate than at present."
"The application of very-long baseline interferometry (VLBI) techniques at meter and decameter wavelengths has proven to be a unique tool for studying a number of different phenomena. Because of the high angular resolution which we achieve with VLBI, candidate objects for study include the compact nuclei and \"jets\" associated with quasars and radio galaxies, pulsars, small knots in galactic supernova remnants, and nonthermal planetary sources. Our investigations have been aimed at determining the emission spectra of these objects, measuring their apparent angular size, and mapping their structure. We expect that these properties will be interrelated, particularly at or below the frequencies at which their spectra peak. As various components of a radio source become self-absorbed the apparent angular structure must change quite radically. Concomitant investigations of transmission properties of the various media which intervene between the source and the observer must be carried out. Often these investigations of the interstellar, interplanetary, and ionospheric media are as interesting as the study of the radio sources themselves."
"Apollo 16 and 17 Lunar Rover position history while transporting astronauts over the lunar surface has been determined to a resolution of better than 1 m and uncertainties of less than 25 m utilizing a specialized very-long baseline interferometry (VLBI) tracking technique. This paper describes the technique, discusses the National Aeronautics and Space Administration worldwide tracking system used to obtain data, discusses the data, and presents results."
"Several topics concerning the processing and interpretation of data obtained with very-long-baseline (VLB) interferometers--i.e., tape-recorder interferometers--from spectral-line radio sources are discussed. The instrumental phase shifts are traced through the interferometer. The spectral resolution and normalization of the visiblity spectrum are discussed. Expressions for estimating fringe amplitude, and the associated signal-to-noise ratio, are derived for the case when the integration time exceeds the coherence time of the interferometer. Procedures are presented for measuring the relative spatial distribution of a widely separated collection of point sources utilizing fringe-phase data and rate of change of fringe-phase data."
"Several tape-recorder interferometer systems have been constructed in the last few years. These systems are used for connecting existing radio-telescope systems into interferometers, with baselines ranging from a few kilometers to nearly the diameter of the earth. The NRAO Mark II interferometer system is in wide use. This, and the fact that its properties are typical of those of such systems in general, justifies a detailed description of the system. The system is based on a television-type rotating-head video recorder. One-bit sampled data are recorded at a 4-Mb rate. After recovery, the data are processed in special-purpese digital devices and general-purpose digital computers to complete the interferometer system. For purpose of this description, the software is regarded as an intrinsic part of the system."
"The Stanford radio telescope array is a fast image-forming interferometer using earth rotation synthesis to produce a brightness map of the continuum radiation from a portion of the sky using data obtained in one 10-h observation. The array consists of five 18.3-m diam paraboloid antennas mounted on an east-west line in such a way that pairs of antennas span all spacings from 1 to 9 times the unit spacing of 22.9 m. At the operating wavelength of 2.8 cm (10 690 MHz) the half-peak beamwidth is 18\".8 and the grating-lobe spacing is 4'.2, both in the east-west direction. The antennas, which were constructed at Stanford, are equatorially mounted and have a range of motion in declination from the south horizon to the north pole and in hour angle from horizon to horizon or ±5 h, whichever is less. Both hour angle and declination motions are controlled by chain-drive mechanisms. The electronic receiving system includes tnnnel-diode preamplifiers followed by mixers and an IF system with a passband from 10 to 70 MHz; both upper and lower sidebands are accepted. The local oscillators at the antennas are phase locked to a reference signal which is distributed from a centrally located oscillator. A system for monitoring variations in the electrical lengths of the reference-signal cables is incorporated using modulated reflectors at the five antennas. The IF signals from the antenna pass through 9-b variable delay lines and the signals from each of the ten possible antenna pairs are then fed into ten analog multipliers. An on-line computer samples the output waveform of each multiplier five times per second and digitally filters the data to estimate the complex correlation of the signals averaged over any desired time interval. The computer also sets the delays, monitors various equipment, and controls the data recording and operator displays. In addition, it can be used off-line to perform the Fourier transformation or similar processing required to derive a map of a radio source. The sensitivity with the tunnel diode preamplifiers gives a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 to 1 for a point source of flux density 3 × 10-28W ċm-2Hz-1; this assumes a system noise temperature of 1000 K, an antenna aperture efficiency of 30 percent, and an observing time of 10 h. An increase in sensitivity by a factor of 10 will be obtained by the use of uncooled degenerate parametric amplifiers."
"The synthesis radio telescope (SRT) is an array of 20 simultaneous interferometers formed by 10 fixed and 2 movable antennas on an E-W baseline of 1600 m, operating on the principle of rotational aperture synthesis. It is capable of observing continuum radiation in 4 Stokes parameters and line radiation at 50-, 21-, and 6-cm wavelengths. This paper centers on a description of the electronic system with emphasis on those features by which its exceptional stability has been realized. Included are sections on the mechanical construction and adjustments, the data processing, and some examples of astronomical results."
"An earth-rotational synthesis radio telescope is now operating at a wavelength of 21 cm at Fleurs, near Sydney, Australia. The telescope produces a map of a 1.5 square-degree region of sky in an observing time of 12 to 16 h. In the first stage the resolution is 40\" and the sensitivity (5 times rms noise fluctuations) is about 70 × 10-29. A full range of scanning angles is available for mapping sources between declinations 80°S and 30°S, but mapping of a lower quality is possible at lower declinations. The telescope consists of two independent arrays used consecutively. One is in an east-west line and the other is in a north-south line. Each consists of two 13.8-m-diam paraboloids and thirty-two 5.8-m paraboloids arranged as a compound grating interferometer. The paraboloids track a source for 8 h and the phases of signals from each paraboloid are rotated continuously to compensate for the movement of the source across the sky. 64 cosine and 64 sine Fourier components of the brightness distribution over the source are extracted simultaneously and each is recorded every minute. After an observation of several hours, a digital computer makes the necessary transformations and produces a map."
"A radio telescope designed for studies of the 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen is described. It combines the techniques of aperture synthesis and digital correlation spectrometry to achieve an angular resolution of 1 arc min within an area of sky of 2° diameter and a frequency resolution variable from 3 to 100 kHz with 80 channels. The telescope comprises four 9-m paraboloids, two fixed and two movable on a 300-m precision E-W track. The system noise is 80 K. Remote local oscillators are controlled in phase to about 1 degree independent of the electrical lengths of distributing cables. An on-line computer provides source positions, and controls telescope tracking, local-oscillator frequency and phase, and incremental delay compensation. It also performs the Fourier transformation of the correlation coefficients and the data logging. The digital correlator uses 3 by 5 level quantization which reduces signal-to-noise degradation due to quantization to a factor 1.16. The telescope sensitivity for emission and absorption studies is discussed and first results are presented."
"A powerful new instrument for meter and dekameter wavelength radio astronomy is described. It will soon be available for both solar and sidereal studies."
"A fixed-baseline millimeter-wave interferometer, operating initially at 13.5 mm, has been put into operation at the Hat Creek Observatory as the first step in the development of a two-element aperture synthesis telescope. The first system consists of a 3-m antenna and a 6-m antenna spaced 265 m apart. Large receiver bandwidths may be used at high frequencies, and this system employs an intermediate frequency bandwidth of about 400 MHz. It also has automatic gain control and a phase stabilized local-oscillator reference cable. Observations may be made either in the continuum or with a 128-channel spectrometer. The baseline vector has been obtained from observations of about 7 QSO's. The instrument has been used to derive accurate absolute positions of interstellar water vapor sources, to study Mercury, Venus, and Mars, and to make crude maps of a few complex continuum sources. Measurements of the interferometer phase fluctuations due to the atmosphere indicate that interferometer is possible under average weather conditions at Hat Creek at wavelengths as short as 2 mm. The synthesis telescope, the next stage, has two 6-m antennas which can be located at various stations on a T-shaped track. The east-west leg is 300 m and the north-south leg is 200 m, permitting full synthesis for sources on the equator and at declinations as low as -30° as well as at high declinations. Operation at wavelengths down to 2 mm will be possible with resolution of 1\"-2\"."
"A small two-antenna interferometer working at a wavelength of 8 mm, with a baseline of 64 m is now completed at the Observatory in Bordeaux. The new instrument is designed for solar studies and for experimentation in millimeter-wave interferometry. The main characteristics are given with some details on techniques used, in particular for local-oscillator (LO) transmission and phase stability, and for antenna drive and encoding systems."
"A 3.5-km long interferometer consisting of the 530 by 30 m Ooty radio telescope, two 13.5-m diameter dishes, and a 5-m diameter dish are described. For generating coherent local-oscillator signals for the interferometer, a simple phase-stable radio link has been developed which uses the sum-frequency method proposed for the VLA antenna. The interferometer, expected to be in operation in 1973, will provide a resolution of about 0'.8×5'.5 arc at 327 MHz and will be able to detect a radio source of flux density 2 × 10-28. Wċm-2Hz-1with a S/N ratio of 5 to 1. A proposed 10-km long synthesis interferometer consisting of the Ooty telescope and 36 dishes of 5-m diameter is also described. At 327 MHz, this instrument will provide beamwidths of 15\" by 3\" arc and 15\" by 20\" arc at declinations of 0° and 30°, respectively. It will have a sensitivity of about 10-28Wċm-2Hz-1for a 9.5-h observing period."
"The 100-m fully steerable radio telescope of the Max-Planck-Institut für Radioastronomie (MPIfR) has now been in service for over a year. The telescope was designed to allow observations in the decimeter and centimeter wavelength regions, with the vastly improved resolution given by the 100-m diameter. During construction of the telescope measurements were made at a wavelength of 75 cm. Since the completion of the adjustments, tests and observations were made at 11-cm and 2.8-cm wavelengths. In particular, at the 2.8-cm wavelength, tests have fully confirmed the design goals. In fact, we hope to extend the operational range of the telescope at least to the wavelength of 1.2 cm. A number of problems, new in this field, had to be solved in the construction of an instrument of this size and precision. Measuring methods are described which allowed adjustment of the surface to ±1 mm. A computer-controlled servo loop allows setting of the telescope to 5\". Experience of operation under various conditions is described."
"The rapid variabilty of pulsar signals and the dispersive nature of the interstellar medium introduce a number of problems which are not inherent in other radio-astronomical observations. These problems are discussed and some of the techniques currently being used to cope with them are described."
"Pulsar observations offer an opportunity to determine the distributions of the magnetic field, electron density, and neutral atomic hydrogen density in the interstellar space. Pulse polarization and time of arrival measurements indicate a relatively uniform magnetic field of about 3 µG, whereas new distance measurements through 21-cm line absorption indicate an electron density of about 0.03 cm-3which is uniform when averaged over large distances (a kiloparsec or more)."
"An essential problem for solar activity forecasting is understanding the physical basis of solar activity phenomena. During the last decade, interest shifted from a global evaluation of the active centers to a detailed study of their microscopic magnetic components. This allows for the possibility of an identification of the flare sites but we do not understand the physical process of the triggering itself. The X-ray data give us some evidence that during a flare the particles were accelerated in two distinct phases. Obviously other processes of particle acceleration are at work on the sun: transient perturbations of the chromosphere linked to type-III bursts are thought to be connected to an acceleration of subrelativistic electrons which may or may not trigger an optical flare. High time resolution data show that many events are so complex that in the future they will have to be taken into account. Since forecasting centers need a worldwide network, they cooperate through the International Ursigram and World Day Service (IUWDS) : They agree on a permanent program of data exchanges and daily-forecasts and on temporary projects. Several such projects are briefly reported in order to illustrate the variety of the requests that a warning center has to fulfill."
"Through the conceptual and-equipment development work and the continuing technical guidance of Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories (AFCRL), the first uniform global network of solar radio monitoring has been established to make accurate routine observations of the sun at frequencies from 245 to 35 000 MHz. From research carried out at AFCRL, several important techniques have been developed having operational, scientific, and forecasting applications. First, the U-shape spectral criteria were developed for a yes-no prediction of principal polar cap absorption (PCA) events. Later, the use of integrated flux density of large bursts was used to forecast the proton flux and magnitude (decibel absorption) of the PCA resulting from the solar disruption. Comprehensive statistical studies of the spectral properties of radio bursts have led to a better understanding of burst-region parameters. More recently, studies of the burst spectral development for spectacular events have been used to investigate the mechanism involved in particle and nonradio emission to ultimately predict the probable spectra of energetic particles and to suggest the times of maximum accelerations during the parent flare."
"The advantages to be obtained from multifrequency operation of the Culgoora radioheliograph were appreciated during the early design phase of the original 80-MHz system and steps were taken then to facilitate the addition of other observing frequencies. The heliograph has already been converted to operate at both 80 and 160 MHz and work is well advanced to add a third frequency of 43.25 MHz. After describing the original 80-MHz system this paper outlines reasons for the choice of these frequencies and shows how the system was modified to incorporate them."
"A radio telescope capable of two-dimensional mapping of the sun at a millimeter wavelength with resolution of a few seconds of arc would add greatly to our knowledge of the sun and solar flares. A design which promises to make such an instrument possible is being studied at present. The novel features of this design are fast rotational synthesis and a technique for using redundancy in the array to calibrate the phases continuously."
"The electrooptical radio spectrograph is presented as a sensitive way to record the spectrum of a relatively wide frequency range with high resolution in both time and frequency. It takes advantage of the high recording density of photographic film and the high data rates of coherent optical processing systems. An instrument is described which records the spectrum over a 100-MHz frequency range. It has a frequency resolution of 130 kHz with low \"sidelobe\" response, good sensitivity, and a time resolution of up to 50 ms. Some of the applications of the instrument to radio astronomy are described."
"The design of a traveling-wave maser (TWM) for radio astronomy is discussed with particular reference to the Onsala system, which at present includes eight masers covering most of the frequency range 1-8 GHz (the frequency range in which the telescope is useful). Data are presented on the maser crystals iron- and chromium-doped rutile. A short discussion of different types of slow-wave structures (SWS's) used as maser interaction circuits, and some design criteria are given. We briefly consider the design of the ferrimagnetic isolator. A new method for rapidly retuning the maser to within a frequency band of the order of 100 MHz is introduced. The cryogenic system and the low-noise front-end waveguide are discussed. Also some general conclusions about the TWM bandwidth and a short survey of masers for frequencies above 10 GHz are given. Finally, we discuss which types of radio-astronomical research programs could most benefit from these extremely low-noise amplifiers."
"The Deep-Space Network (DSN) consists of a world-wide network of 25- and 64-m antennas spaced approximately 120° around the world. The DSN is a precision communications system designed to communicate with and control unmanned spacecraft traveling at interplanetary ranges. The ever increasing complexity and distances of spacecraft missions require that the network capability be kept at the state of the art of telecommunications. To meet this objective, a continuing development program on large antennas, low-noise maser, phase-locked receiving systems, and high-power transmitters has been underway for some years. Recent developments in the performance and evaluation of the antennas and maser receivers are discussed, and developments which have contributed to radio science projects, such as planetary radar astronomy, very long baseline interferometry, pulsar, and other astronomical observations are described. It is also shown how these radio science measurements have been used to evaluate the performance of the antenna-receiver systems."
"The NRAO interferometer is instrumented to receive and process both right- and left-hand circularly polarized signals at 3.7- and 11.1-cm wavelengths. Some of the design considerations and a description of the electronics, including tabular listings of components used to instrument the antennas as an interferometer, are included. The maximum amplitude and phase changes in the interferometer outputs caused by the instrumentation are analyzed and determined to be 5-percent amplitude change and 0.04-rad phase change in the 3.7-cm interferometer outputs over a 4-h interval."
"The correlation of quantized signals yields a lower signal-to-noise ratio than analog correlation by a factor D. The dependence of D on number and spacing of quantization levels, and on quantization rate is shown. A digital cross correlator is described which multiplies the signals from two antennas of a synthesis telescope. One signal is quantized into 5 levels and the other into 3 levels. D = 1.16, a significant improvement over a 2-level correlator where D = 1.57, with little increase in complexity. The complex cross-correlation function of the input signals is generated for 125 delay values, with overall bandwidths of 0.25-8 MHz. Special channels of the correlator monitor signal power and quantizer performance."
"The effects of random phase errors are distinguished from the effects of large-scale phase errors or aberrations on the gain, main lobe efficiency, and beamwidths of reflector antennas. It is shown that one may determine the reflector tolerance only by separately evaluating the two types of errors, and an experimental procedure for accomplishing this by pattern range or astronomical measurements is described."
"The 11-m telescope of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) on Kitt Peak is extensively used for spectral-line observing at millimeter wavelengths. The computers that control the telescope and receiver have been programmed in FORTH. This language provides an extensive vocabulary for the astronomer to use to control his observation and reduce his data. Here we summarize the capabilities provided by the most common words of this vocabulary--capabilities ranging from telescope tracking patterns to fitting line profiles. It is noteworthy that the number of words required for sophisticated observing is large and growing."
"The Green Bank site for the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) and the Sugar Grove site for the Naval Radio Research Laboratory (NRRL) were located fairly close together with the hope that both could share in the locally relatively low radio noise environment that existed when the installations were first built. The procederes which have been followed to maintain, as far as possible, the scientific value of this environment are described, and some examples of the degree to which this effort is succeeding are given. Similar problems will arise at the site chosen for the very large array (VLA) in New Mexico and these are discussed briefly."
 "The mamimal-realization technique for a symmetric transfer-function matrix suggested earlier has been simplified in the light of the algorithm suggested recently by Chen and Mittal, thereby significantly reducing the computing time and memory storage required."
"Chakravarti and Worland have proposed a class of algorithms far the numerical solution of equations and systems of equations of the form y'' = f(x, y), y(x0) = y0, y'(x0) = y'0. This letter presents a modifications of these methods to provide automatic estimates of the local truncation error."
"Conditions for neglecting the effects of hole motion in an intrinsic semiconductor subjected to a constant magnetic field are derived from the hydrodynamical equations for the charge carriers. Under the collision-dominated regime in semiconductor materials where the electron-hole mass ratio is very small, the applied magnetic field and electron drift velocities values are shown to be limited to prescribed ranges in order that a single stream model be valid."
"A parentheses-free code is suggested for the description of two-terminal electrical networks for computer analysis."
"Small-signal traveling-wave amplification and Gunn effect in semiconductors are discussed from the power flow point of view. Both phenomena give rise to instabilities that are of resistive character in the sense that they depend essentially on finite relaxation time. The known conditions for traveling-wave amplification--carrier drift velocity larger than the phase velocity--and for the Gunn effect --negative differential mobility--are verified when there is a negative loss in the semiconducting medium."
"From considerations of the piezoelectric effect it is shown that dislocations are generated by high fields such as those produced by the traveling dipole domain in a Gunn diode. This eventually causes failure of the device. The effects of heat generated in the active layer are shown to aggravate this phenomenon."
"Experimental results of efficient magnetic bubble detection with a semiconductor Hall element larger than a magnetic bubble by the full use of the magnetic flux from a bubble are described. Experimental results with InSb Hall elements of various geometries for a bubble in YFeO3revealed that the maximum output appeared with a Hall element slightly larger than a bubble. About 4.4 mV with an S/N of 18 dB was obtained at 23 mA with a n-type InSb Hall element of 235 × 105 × 3.5 µm3and 30 Ω for a 98-µm bubble in a 60-µm thick YFeO3at a bias field of 30 G and at a rotating field of 2 Hz. This arrangement may especially be useful for the detection of a small bubble in garnet, because the Hall element can be made larger, resulting in the easier fabrication and higher output."
"A discussion is presented on magnetostatic surface waves propagating in an arbitrary direction on a YIG plate one of whose surfaces is metallized. It is found that a significantly larger range of propagation angle is allowed for surface waves that are localized at the metallized YIG surface than for those that are localized at the unmetallized surface."
"The results of continuing investigation in the area of optimal control of electromechanical transients in a power system to improve transient stability are presented. A third-order model of a power system is discussed. The results are compared with those obtained using a second-order representation of previous work [1]-[3]."
"An \"electrically transparent fluid barrier\" (ETFB) is proposed as a means of separating fluids of different conductivity for use in two- or three-dimensional field mapping experiments. The concept is demonstrated in the context of a conducting analog to the problem of the microstrip transmission line."
"A modification of the B. L. Ho algorithm is presented for suboptimally approximating the parameters of multi-input, multi-output, time-discrete linear systems. The cost function is taken to be the sum of the squared errors of the impulse response."

"Impression of an external signal upon an oscillator of similar fundamental frequency affects both the instantaneous amplitude and instantaneous frequency. Using the assumption that time constants in the oscillator circuit are small compared to the length of one beat cycle, a differential equation is derived which gives the oscillator phase as a function of time. With the aid of this equation, the transient process of \"pull-in\" as well as the production of a distorted beat note are described in detail. It is shown that the same equation serves to describe the motion of a pendulum suspended in a viscous fluid inside a rotating container. The whole range of locking phenomena is illustrated with the aid of this simple mechanical model."
"Injection locking of microwave solid-state oscillators is discussed, based on the familiar theorem that the total impedance times the current is equal to the applied voltage. Both quasi-static and dynamic analyses of the locking range, large-signal injection, locking stability, and AM and FM noise are given, and recent experimental work is reviewed briefly. No applications of injection locking are discussed in detail."
"The basic principles of laser injection locking are discussed and the status of recent experimental work is reviewed. The subject is introduced by means of appropriate lower frequency and microwave injection-locking circuits. These are used to explore the basic physical phenomena involved and to illustrate the essential role of gain saturation in laser injection locking. Oscillators and below-threshold regenerative amplifiers are discussed to provide a more complete and cohesive picture. Experimental results with a variety of CW and quasi-CW injection-locked amplifiers including unstable resonator geometries are presented. Preliminary results with a novel injection-locked passively Q-switched CO2amplifier are also given."
"A methodology is discussed for quantitatively computing the social costs, or external diseconomies, which result from the production of electric power in conventional coal-fired steam electric plants. With the available data, and our present level of understanding, it is possible to obtain preliminary numbers which place the social cost for the technology of the mid and late 1960's at ≥ 11.5 ±2 mills/kWh, somewhat more than the price of bulk power at the plant bus bar. In applying controls to limit the social costs, control costs are incurred. If the optimum level of control is taken as that level at which the sum of the social costs and the control costs is minimum, then we estimate the total social and control costs with optimum control as ≥4.5 ± 1.5 mills/kWh and the costs of controlling to that level as ≥3 ± 1 mills/kWh. These numbers will probably be reduced, and the optimum levels for control increased, as new technologies are developed. The paper is limited to a straightforward development of social costs. No attempt is made to develop policy implications or to draw broad conclusions on the basis of the costs which are derived."
"The term soliton has recently been coined to describe a pulselike nonlinear wave (solitary wave) which emerges from a collision with a similar pulse having unchanged shape and speed. To date at least seven distinct wave systems, representing a wide range of applications in applied science, have been found to exhibit such solutions. This review paper covers the current status of soliton research, paying particular attention to the very important \"inverse method\" whereby the initial value problem for a nonlinear wave system can be solved exactly through a succession of linear calculations."
"We have observed, by using a nonlinear lumped LC network, the fundamental properties of solitons indicated by Zabusky and Kruskal, where 1) an initial pulselike disturbance breaks into many solitons, 2) a soliton of high amplitude travels faster than one of low amplitude, and 3) solitons preserve their identities after interacting with each other nonlinearly. Some of the fundamental properties of solitons are explained physically in terms of properties of the nonlinear LC network, and are demonstrated mathematically by establishing analytical expressions for solitons in a particular network."
"A novel filter device, employing bulk acoustic waves, has been demonstrated experimentally. Inherently simple in construction, miniature and robust, it provides bandwidths of several percent at HF with low insertion loss."
"A simple proof of the Weierstrass approximation theorem is given which uses only elementary Fourier series results. This is an alternative to a recent proof of the subject theorem by Giardina and Chirlian, where Fourier integrals and band-limited functions were employed."
"The smoothed coherence transform (SCOT) is defined and examples of its uses and shortcomings are given. Computation of this function shows promise for measuring time delays between weak broad-band correlated noises received at two sensors."
"The refractive-index profile and impulse response of three low-loss multimode optical fibers have been measured. Pulse dispersion of about 1.5 ns or less was observed in two of the fibers, each 1 km long."
"Previous measurements of pulse broadening in the CGW-Bell-10 optical fiber showed very low dispersion ( < 2 ns/km). We recently measured pulse spreading as a function of length in this fiber. The data indicate a (length)1/2dependence, at wavelengths of 0.6328, 0.9, and 1.06 µm, for long fiber lengths (> 550 m) which are of practical significance."
 "A new Poisson transform pair is derived and is used to evaluate some integrals occurring in a wide class of probability density function moment problems, and to generalize an integral of Gradshteyn and Ryzhik."
"GaAs transferred electron amplifiers with 110-mW saturated power output at 35 GHz have been designed and fabricated. Small signal gain of 13 dB, 3-GHz bandwidth, and noise figures as low as 16.2 dB have been observed. Two basic amplifier designs which have been investigated are described."
 "An optical-repeater error-rate experiment is described in which the carrier generator is a directly modulated double heterojunction GaAs laser. It is shown that 274-Mb/s modulation can be achieved with sufficiently high quality that the received signal can be regenerated with error rates in accordance with predictions based on receiver thermal noise."
"An alternative signaling scheme for sequential decision feedback is discussed. With this scheme, a simple solution is found for certain synchronization problems that arise from the use of frequency-shift keyed (FSK) signals. Furthermore, no reduction in the transmission rate is suffered even in the presence of appreciable round-trip delay time."
"The global asymptotic stability of nonlinear feedback systems x = Ax + bf(ξTx) where the matrix A has purely imaginary roots is investigated. Narendra and Taylor have studied nonlinear systems where they assumed A to be negative definite. In this letter, conditions are derived which guarantee that all bounded solutions approach an equilibrium state."
"It is shown by an example that the relations defining mechanical actions on charges and currents moving with respect to an inertial observer do not coincide, if referred to the latter, with the relations referred to an observer moving with charges and currents, even when velocities are nonrelativistic."
"Integral expressions for the gate leakage current in a MOSFET are derived on the basis of Schottky emission across the gate insulator and on the internal self-heating due to device power dissipation. Computer evaluation of these integrals yields gate leakage current curves that exhibit the same characteristics observed experimentally."
"The conditions for electromagnetic reciprocity can be satisfied or not by a given anisotropic medium, depending on the particular choice of a complex reference frame. Consequently, when statements are made on an anisotropic medium being reciprocal or not, polarization of the wave should be specified."
"The capacitance-voltage characteristics of a new device, the three-terminal digital MOS varactor, are presented. These devices do not require external bias decoupling circuitry thereby resulting in smaller circuits."
"A simple approach is developed for numerical evaluation of a convolution-type integral. This method involves deriving and solving numerically a differential equation instead of evaluating the original integral by the regular method. It shows great advantages in saving computer time. The most important use of the method occurs when the integral must be evaluated repeatedly."
"We estimate a plane wave signal in the presence of M plane wave noise sources, using N samplers along a line. For almost all sets of noise wavenumbers, N ≥ 2 and ε > 0, there exist sampler locations such that the estimation error is less than ε."
"Recent letters on decibel are commented upon, and standardization proposed by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is mentioned."
"The use of a broad-band random noise source for both the illuminating and the reference signal in bistatic holography is discussed, whereby the combination (interference) signal is first subjected to a narrow-band multifrequency filtering procedure. The resulting recording of a multiplicity of single-frequency one-dimensional zone plates is then used for reconstruction."
"The well-known methods of iteration used suitably can yield a more accurate and rapidly convergent computation for the values of many functions. One typical example is the base-2 logarithm-antilogarithm computation. Some recently proposed techniques are reviewed and compared with an iterative process for computation using a fixed number of iterations. It is shown that the latter yields improved accuracy and can be implemented either as a subroutine or as a hardwired peripheral device for, say, a minicomputer."

"This article traces the evolution of minicomputers from 1955 to 1973 and forecasts their near-future characteristics and uses. Advances significant in the growth of minicomputers are tutorially described as they occurred in nineteen different machines. Only computers having attained the status \"commercially available\" are included. The entire discussion is based on two descriptors: the first, depicting the content and use of minicomputer systems (hardware, software, applications, and tradeoffs); and the second, outlining the size and type of systems (simple, complex, general-purpose, and special-purpose). Future minicomputers will continue to diversify in the four general directions indicated by the size-type descriptor. By superimposing the user desires for easier programming, better performance, and lower cost onto the size-type descriptor, the article concludes with a description of future systems."
"After a general description of the major hardware elements of a minicomputer, the system is discussed from the viewpoint of a machine-language programmer. It is shown that the machine imposes certain constraints upon the programmer. These constraints are necessary in order to provide computation capability at a reasonable cost. In order to increase the power of the minicomputer without letting the cost become excessive, techniques have evolved whereby an instruction entering the processor for execution need carry only a portion of the total information required. Through previous instructions the processor has been set up for the current instructions. Microprogramming is viewed as a mechanism for increasing the possible power of a given machine instruction. A natural outgrowth of a setup processor and microprogramming is alterable control store."
"A fast microprogrammed sequencer for computer timing and control is described. This module can be made compatible with various commercially available computer modules. The design can provide sequencing times on the order of 120 ns for nonbranch microsteps, and is fully programmable. The sequencer provides multiway indexed branching and microsubroutine calls. The cost of the sequencer is relatively low (parts cost less than roughly 500 dollars), making it ideal for small controller design and also for educational applications."
"Although minicomputer hardware costs are rapidly decreasing, minicomputer software seems to be continuously increasing in cost. A contributing factor to this situation is a lack of recognition of the scope of the problem of software production, which must be considered to include analysis, design, implementation, integration, testing, delivery, and maintenance. Various tools for minicomputer software production are discussed, including specification and design standards, software engineering techniques, implementation and testing methods, and project controls."
"This paper presents a tutorial survey of the function and construction of executive systems for minicomputers. A modular approach to the construction of device schedulers, swapping and multiprogramming supervisors, and file systems is emphasized. Considerable use is made of programming technology borrowed from large-scale computer systems, but specialized to the needs of small-scale minicomputer systems. The paper also describes the use of high-level languages, structured programming, and program-development systems in the application of this technology to the minicomputer environment."
"A two-level software system for minicomputers suitable for use in real-time production monitoring and control applications has been designed and implemented. The first level consists of a general-purpose file system implemented in the form of a voluntary virtual memory which can be added to most minicomputer software systems. The second-level software is a set of data management primitives which permit the definition, creation, maintenance, modification, and referencing of large, interlinked, complex data bases which arise in discrete parts manufacturing applications. The software system is described. The application to a discrete parts manufacturing control system is described along with experimental measures of response time and memory requirements."
"Software implementation for automatic test systems controlled by minicomputers can be a costly and time-consuming process. A procedure for implementing software which tends to minimize costs and avoid delays caused by unexpected problems is described. The procedure consists of completely defining the test system functions and performing a series of hardware versus software tradeoffs during the design and implementation process. The purpose of the tradeoffs is to determine the least costly method of implementing tester functions by either hardware, software, or some combination of hardware and software. Delays caused by unexpected problems are reduced by including hardware and software debugging aids which shorten the time to validate the tester system functions. An example of implementing an automatic test system in accordance with these procedures is provided."
"An on-line minicomputer information system which has achieved diverse applicability in the medical environment is presented. The motivations for \"total medical information systems\" are enumerated. The controversy over large-scale computers versus minicomputers is addressed. The design goals and present capabilities of GEMISCH are discussed, and a survey of present applications is included to attest to the versatility of the system."
"Some problems in speech-intelligibility research are discussed, and the advantages of using a dedicated minicomputer system for this research are pointed out. A minicomputer-based signal-processing laboratory in the Department of Computing and Information Sciences and Engineering at Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, is described. The system consists of a PDP®-11/45 minicomputer integrated with graphic display, tablet, and speech input/output equipment. It has been configured to provide on-line interactive facility for data preparation, data manipulation, and intelligibility measurement. Two specific approaches to intelligibility enhancement are discussed along with the roles of subject and researcher as components of the measurement system."
"A substantial number of the world's research laborstories in low-, medium-, and high-energy physics have been among the earliest users of minicomputer data acquisition and control systems. A decade ago, the commercially available minicomputers were put to use gathering data from physics experiments using particle beams from accelerators. As early as 1965, engineers and physicists at several North American accelerator laboratories were installing minicomputer-based control systems for the purpose of automating particle-beam transport lines. Since that time, the use of minicomputers for special instrumentation, data acquisition, and supervisory control has mushroomed throughout the accelerator world. The application of minicomputers to the accelerator beam diagnostics, experimental interface development, accelerator structure tuning, magnet field mapping, ion source operation, nuclear instrumentation, and data handling as practiced at LAMPF and other accelerator laboratories throughout the world will be related in this paper."
"A minicomputer-based data acquisition and analysis system has been developed and applied to a variety of experiments involving the interactions between laser radiation and real and simulated atmospheres. This paper describes the system, its software, and main applications. System features include signal-analysis capability of both pulsed and continuous lasers, high data acquisition and computation rates, and real-time display of results. Basic system components include two minicomputers, four analog-to-digital converters, and a disk storage unit. One of the main applications of the system is as a dual-parameter analyzer in experiments to determine the transmission of laser energy in controlled atmospheres. Efforts to complete these experiments were unsuccessful until minicomputer capability was added. The resulting real-time computation and display enabled real-time calibration and experiment monitoring. Minicomputer system application on the difficult experiments has also proven successful."
"The conceptualization of the ongoing neuroelectric activity as a stochastic time series has provided a framework for the utilization of the small computer in the laboratory. Laboratory computers provide extensive computational, filing, and control capabilities which are being incorporated into the routine investigation of neurophysiological phenomena. The computational procedures implemented include both time and frequency domain techniques. Equipment utilized includes special-purpose digital computers, general-purpose minicomputers, and minicomputers with graphics capability used as intelligent terminals to larger machines."
"The use of a minicomputer on-line to identify and measure the time series of different nerve impulses mixed in a single recording channel is described. The study involves electrical discharges recorded simultaneously from two of the olfactory receptors found on the antenna of the male red-banded leaf roller moth. These receptor cells were stimulated by odors normally secreted by the female which have been shown to act as powerful sex attractants to the male. The computer program stores the time interval between nerve spikes and 30 100-µs samples of the waveform of each spike detected. An ensemble of up to 1000 sets of samples can be stored in the course of an experiment on a 32K-word magnetic disk, through a data channel facility. A statistic is calculated on the sampled data for each spike in the ensemble. The range in values of this statistic is used to characterize the data by plotting a histogram of the nerve-spike parameter. This display can then be partitioned so as to identify the two units of interest. On the basis of this identification, a distinct time series for each receptor is computed and filed on the minitape for further data analysis."
"A computer-controlled engine test cell was developed for conducting complex transient experiments with automotive engines. The test cell uses a minicomputer with a 16 000-word 16-b core memory to perform data acquisition and closed-loop control of the engine and dynamometer. A table-driven real-time control program is used to duplicate the effects of vehicle, transmission, and road on engine operation. Reference data and acquired data are exchanged over a high-speed communications channel between the minicomputer and a centralized data acquisition computer (DAC) system. Data can be plotted against time or cross-plotted against other parameters on a graphic cathode-ray-tube display peripheral to the minicomputer. The user can interact with the system to change parameters during the running of an experiment."
"A racetrack totslisator is described which is capable of processing 300 bets/s from up to 1000 ticket-issuing machines. The system contains minicomputers which provide high-reliability low-cost computing power, capable of supporting the requirements of any racetrack in the United States or Canada. The computers are duplexed. Both computers process every bet and operator action. Either computer can continue processing if the other fails. The software provides extensive error checking of all hardware components. All bets are logged to magnetic tape, which can be used to restart the system in case of a system \"blow.\" The real-time program was written in machine language and a specially developed higher level language. The master file contains 35 000 instructions. A typical program may contain 20 000 words of program and data tables. An off-Hne program is used to generate individual systems, tailored to the requirements of specific racetracks."
 "The axial backscattering cross section of semi-infinite cones blunted by conic section surfaces of revolution is calculated from physical optics. A single expression for cross section, a function of wavelength and the geometric parameters of the scatterer, applies to all tips."

"By using a modified expression of the orthogonality relation between normal modes, the stationary expression for the scattering coefficients at the uniform piezoelectric waveguide junction is obtained by a procedure similar to that used in electromagnetic waveguides. By the Rayleigh-Ritz method, the scattering coefficients are expressed by simple expression."
"The effect of spurious leakage signals on injection-locked oscillators is discussed. The instantaneous frequency and instantaneous phase shift are derived to show when such signals have negligible effect."
"The microwave detection characteristics of photodarlington 2N5780 series and MRD14B have been investigated in X band. The photodarlingtons produced a 10-dB better output than a conventional 1N23C point-contact detector. The mechanism of microwave detection was found to be due to the conventional potential barrier at the p-n junction rather than photovoltaic or conductive effects."
"A hybrid technique utilizing the method of successive iterations in conjunction with a variational technique is used to calculate the losses in optical resonators. The method is described and the rate of convergence, accuracy, and saving in computer time are illustrated for a typical problem."
"The dependence of temperature coefficient of resistance of polycrystalline thin silver film on grain size diameter has been investigated theoretically. It has been found that it decreases with the decrease of grain size. For very small grain size, it is less than the bulk value and is negative in some cases, whereas for very large grain size it approaches the bulk value."
"A common method of detecting weak signals in the presence of noise is to digitize samples of the signal and average the samples to reduce the effect of noise. It is shown that errors in the digitizer can affect this process even if they are much smaller than the noise variance."
 "The gain of a partially homogeneous line at line center is shown to saturate according to the following formula: γ0(y;Iv/Is) = γ0(y;0)/(1 + Iv/Is)m(y)where y =√ln 2 ΔvL/ΔvD. Ivis the intensity of the incident radiation at line center, Isis the saturation intensity, and ΔvL, ΔvDare the Lorentzian and Doppler linewidths. Numerically calculated values for m(y) are tabulated, and show that m(y) approaches ½ as y → 0 and 1 as y → ∞ in accordance with the known limiting cases of inhomogeneous and homogeneous broadening, respectively. When y is known, the saturation intensity Iscan easily be determined from gain saturation measurements by using the table of m(y) provided."
"For data communication through a time-dispersive channel, the optimum channel decoder is shown to be a network which is matched to the channel encoder. In this context, channel decoding precedes equalization in the receiver hierarchy."
"A simple tunnel diode circuit is described which can generate narrow current pulses from low-amplitude voltage pulses at instances in time corresponding to either the leading or the trailing edge of the driving pulses. The pulse generator is capable of producing 1-ns pulses at a rate of about 330 MHz."
"A modification of the traditional least square estimate is introduced and applied to the harmonic analysis of noisy periodic waveforms. The recursive Kalman filter approach is reviewed and the two methods are compared. The modified least square estimate is found to be a more efficient computational technique when the form of the signal allows its use."

"In many cases, it is impractical or impossible to make antenna pattern measurements on a conventional far-field range; the distance to the radiating far field may be too long, it may be impractical to move the antenna from its operating environment to an antenna range, or the desired amount of pattern data may require too much time on a far-field range. For these and other reasons, it is often desirable or necessary to determine far-field antenna patterns from measurements made in the radiating near-field region; three basic techniques for accomplishing this have proven to be successful. In the first technique, the aperture phase and amplitude distributions are sampled by a scanning field probe, and then the measured distributions are transformed to the far field. In the second technique, a plane wave that is approximately uniform in amplitude is created by a feed and large reflector in the immediate vicinity of the test antenna. And in the third technique, the test antenna is focused within the radiating near-field region, patterns are measured at the reduced range, and then the antenna is refocused to infinity. Each of these techniques is discussed, and the various advantages and limitations of each technique are presented."
"A phenomenological and electron-theoretical study of the electrodynamics of rotating systems is developed in the three-dimensional form. In the former part of the present paper, the electromagnetic field equations in an isotropic and homogeneous medium performing arbitrary accelerated motion relative to an inertial reference frame are derived from the phenomenological viewpoint, under the assumptions that the observer is at rest in the inertial or rotating reference frame and that the macroscopic properties of the material medium are not changed by the acceleration acting upon it. With the aid of the classical electron theory, the latter part of the present paper discusses the electromagnetic field equations in rotating media as viewed from the inertial or rotating frame, presenting an electron-theoretical basis for the electrodynamics of rotating media. In addition, the electromagnetic effects caused by the inertial forces accompanying the rotational motion, i.e., the centrifugal and Coriolis forces, are investigated in detail."
"The fundementals of optical fiber transmission systems including the fiber transmission medium, sources suitable for use as a carrier, modulation and detection techniques, and some system design considerations are reviewed. The advent of low-loss optical fibers brings new dimensions to optical communication prospects. Fibers may soon be used much as wire pairs of coaxial cable are now used in communication systems. Transmission losses as low as 2 dB/km have been achieved. Experimental repeaters for fiber systems with 10-9error rate at about 300-Mb/s pulse rate have been reported. Fiber cabling and splicing are among the problems requiring new ideas in order to make feasible an operable system."
  "The normalized cutoff wavelengths for the first six higher order modes in a square waveguide with a circular inner conductor are presented. Some of these results are compared with those obtained recently by Laura et al."
"The method of Seviora and Sablatash for obtaining adjoint digital filters is interpreted for general signal-flowgraph application. It is shown that the procedure reduces to the reversal operation for signal flowgraphs. Motivated by this result, a simple alternative derivation of the adjoint signal flowgraph is presented which is based on direct sensitivity models and Mason's topological formula. Tellegen's theorem or the calculus of variations are not required. The derivation is an extension to interreciprocal linear systems of an argument used by Leeds and Ugron for reciprocal networks."
"Recent experimental observations on silicon avalanche diode multipliers operated at about 35-GHz output frequency are presented. High-rank (up to 35) frequency multiplication is achieved with output power over 250 mW and conversion loss of 13 dB. The possibility of frequency multiplication by any integer n ranging from 8 to 35 with the same diode and without any idler circuit is pointed out. It is concluded that any output frequency can be selected between 28 and 39 GHz by varying the input frequency and the circuit tuning."
"A new type of stripe-geometry laser is proposed. A very small lateral current spreading and a transverse single-mode oscillation are realized in this structure with a near-field pattern as narrow as 3 µm."
"The authors of the above letter[1] used Kalman filtering to estimate the harmonic coefficients of a periodic waveform from noisy samples. The purpose of this letter is to show that their technique is identical to a recursive least squares procedure."
"In the teaching of optimization methods such as in Control courses, a frequently used introductory example is the classical brachistochrone problem. The Calculus of Variations solution is usually obtained by introducing a new parameter to solve the nonlinear differential equation. This letter presents an alternative method which introduces as a parameter the instantaneous angular direction of the falling particle and obtains a solution in which a nonlinear differential equation does not arise."
"The translational force on a bubble domain produced by a gradient in the spacing between the bubble material and a Permalloy film is derived in terms of the spacing and the bubble aspect ratio. The resulting expression can be useful in designing bubble devices and in estimating the effect of a gradient in spacing on the margins of bubble devices."
 "A model for excitation characteristic of a magnetic circuit has been assumed. An algorithm for finding the values of the parameters from known data which results in least square error is given. The power of the method is such that there is no constraint on the initial values chosen."
"A lateral reference/sensor configuration is described which appears to have overcome the problems caused by steel reinforcing in concrete. Previously used reference/sensor systems performed as predicted on nonreinforced road surfaces but exhibited gain and lateral offset variations as a function of distance along a steel-reinforced highway. An automatic lateral guidance system using the new configuration has been successfully tested on continuously reinforced concrete at speeds up to 80 mi/h."
"Occasionally a Rayleigh-distributed randomly varying voltage is recorded in decibels and the mean, second moment, and variance of the original voltage are desired. It is shown that these quantities can be obtained given only the mean of the decibel record. Some important related formulas are given."
"A pulse pair waveform can be transmitted in order to estimate the mean of the wake velocity power spectrum at a given range sampling station of an object reentering the atmosphere. It is shown here how one may select the spacing between pulses in a pair so as to minimize the predicted variance of the mean velocity estimate. This variance is a function of the radar wavelength, the pulse signal-to-noise ratio, and the true spread of the wake power spectrum to be measured. These parameters are all assumed known a priori or available from previous data. For a given wavelength and power spectrum, the optimum pulse pair spacing to be used depends only on the signal-to-noise ratio and not on the number of pairs. Therefore, one can simply send, at the optimum spacing, the fewest pulse pairs required to achieve the necessary accuracy and thus minimize the radar energy required as well."
"Injection-locking experiments have been conducted with the punched-through-diode oscillator, and the results have agreed well with theory. This confirms the nature of oscillations to be of a negative-resistance type and not of a relaxation type."

"This paper provides an explanation for previously unexplained aspects of the transient experiments of Kuru, Robson, and Kino [1]. It is shown that in a transient experiment on a dipole domain in a transferred electron device, the ratio of change in charge at the domain to the charge transferred at the external terminals is strongly dependent on the magnitude of the bias step. For a small bias step the charge transferred at the external terminals is nearly equal to the change in domain charge, while for a quenching transient the charge transferred at the external terminals is about one-half the initial domain charge."
"The RCI model is an electric network consisting of lumped resistors, capacitors, and controlled current sources. It simulates the three-dimensional time-dependent transport and continuity equations and the Poisson equation for nondegenerated semiconductors without additional restriction except the spatial discretization error. Therefore, the model is suitable to describe the steady-state solution as well as the small- and large-signal transient behavior of semiconductor devices. The disadvantages of the Linvill model and the Ohtsuki-Kani model have been avoided by introducing excess variables and new model potentials. For constant mobility, the passive components of the network become linear. All nonlinearities are focused on the voltage-controlled current sources that have simple transfer functions."
"It has been experimentally shown that the product of the mean frequency deviation of FM noise and the external quality factor varies inversely proportional to the power output of Gunn oscillators. This behavior of FM noise of Gunn oscillators with power output is in very good agreement with theoretical predictions of large-signal diffusion noise in GaAs devices. At optimum power output, the calculated and experimentally determined noise measure ranges between 17 and 22 dB."
"When liquid is driven in pulses through two small apertures with liquid between them, there is a hydrodynamic pumping phenomena in the liquid flow. The pulsation can be produced by volume variations obtained from a piezoelectric crystal. The device works as an impulse pump, which can be controlled by modulated electric pulses. When the liquid is ink, the device can be used to generate a dot pattern on paper. Using this technique, two types of printing devices have been developed: one for printing alphanumeric characters in a 7 × 5 matrix, where speeds of more than 1000 characters/s are obtained, and another for copying pictures by a scanning method."
"A design approach is presented that optimizes the component areas of integrated circuits so as to maximize the yield. The performance index to be optimized is defined as the chip yield divided by the chip area, which corresponds to the number of good chips in a wafer. The area of each component is determined to maximize this performance index by a nonlinear programming technique. The design of integrated circuits with respect to the yield may be mostly narrowed down to the determination of component areas, since the process parameters cannot be adjusted individually for each circuit component. This design approach is described in more detail for the kinds of components whose surface areas cannot be uniquely determined by their nominal parameter values. As a demonstration, the width of a diffused resistor in bipolar integrated circuits was optimized for some example circuits. Some useful results have been obtained for the design of circuit patterns."
"Techniques for extracting stored information from an array of plasma display elements using optical detection systems are presented. Two specific electronic drive schemes and several experimental area photodetector systems used in realizing readout capability in display systems are described. Limitations of optical read-out systems due to optical noise generated by the display panel and by incident ambient light are discussed."
"A numerical model is presented allowing calculation of the dc, ac, and large-signal parameters of field-effect transistors (FET's). The numerical procedure is based on finite-difference approximations to the full time-dependent set of equations. The scheme presented uses centered difference quotients and an implicit treatment of the continuity equation. It is shown to be absolutely stable and accurate for time steps below 1 ps. A set of numerical data calculated for one typical example is compared systematically with experimental values. Excellent agreement between measured and computed values is found for the dc characteristics. Small-signal solutions, obtained by Fourier transform methods are also close to the empirical values. The good fit between experiment and numerical simulation is a thorough validation of both the physical model and the numerical procedure."
"The several effects of interface states in limiting the performance of surface channel charge-coupled devices (CCD's) are described and evaluated. The limitations on transfer efficiency may be minimized by using a background charge in the device at all times. Experimental measurements of transfer inefficiency on three-phase devices and a two-phase device are presented and correlated with the predicted values, although measurements of the density and capture cross sections of interface states after device fabrication are required for accurate quantitative predictions of transfer inefficiencies. It is concluded that trapping effects are a limitation on the transfer efficiencies obtainable in surface channel charge-coupled devices, particularly, for example, at frequencies less than 1 MHz for devices having 10-µm-long transfer electrodes, but are not a direct limitation on the high-frequency performance. The effect of interface states in adding transfer noise onto the charge packets is also described, and is shown to be small, although in some devices it may reduce the signal-to-noise ratios that might otherwise be possible."
"The implications of current constriction at a planar contact to GaAs are inferred from the results of a simpler case (current flow to a small conducting cylinder). It is argued that a number of the pathological properties of Gunn diodes can be explained in terms of this mechanism."
"Two-dimensional electron beams in certain electrostatic fields are dealt with, ignoring space-charge effects. The central trajectories of electron beams were previously given. The electron beam in a suitable electrostatic field fluctuates near the given trajectory just as a paraxial electron beam fluctuates near the axis. If both fluctuations agree completely, the electron beam considered can be regarded as a projection of the paraxial electron beam. This situation is called here the mapping of electron beams and is verified in the mapping theorem."
"Using a fixed cathode boundary field model we examine analytically the form and stability of inhomogeneous prethreshold electric-field profiles in long bulk negative differential mobility (NDM) semiconductors. We show that the electric-field profiles and their associated current-voltage relationships depend in a detailed way on the characteristics of the bulk material (e.g., the velocity-electric-field relation) and on the boundary conditions imposed on the bulk. We investigate situations leading to the nucleation of a high-field domain at the cathode and find that for its occurrence: 1) the electric field at the cathode boundary must lie within the NDM region; and 2) space-charge neutrality must be approximated within the vicinity of the cathode. When these conditions are satisfied the current instability at threshold is accompanied by bulk electric-field values that are below the threshold field for NDM. The stability conclusions are drawn from a small-signal analysis that avoids many of the approximations of earlier studies. Supplementary numerical computations are included to demonstrate that the subsequent time development of the current instability depends in a detailed way on: 1) conditions at the cathode boundary; and 2) the external circuit. It is shown that the recycling Gunn effect cathode-to-anode transit-time mode in a resistive circuit is not a necessary consequence of the bulk having a region of NDM."
"The plasma display cell, in the normal mode, operates as a bistable ON-OFF element. Under certain conditions, by applying the appropriate sustaining signal, the cell can be maintained in one of several possible ON states that can be distinguished from each other by the light or current output of each state. Conditions on a class of sustaining signals that can sustain the cell in two ON states and an OFF state are described."

 "Performance and reliability of amorphous semiconductor devices that deal with the handling of information in the form of switching, modulation, storage, and display are discussed. Structural changes between a disordered and a more ordered state and the concomitant large change in many material properties offer the possibility of using amorphous semiconductors for high-density information storage and high-resolution display devices. The structural changes can be initiated by various forms of energy such as an electrical pulse, a short light pulse, or a brief light exposure. Many materials show good structural reversibility. The sensitivity of an amorphous photostructural film is amplified by several orders of magnitude by first forming a latent image by photonucleation and subsequent dry development by heat or radiation. Examples of optical contrast and resolution in image formation are given. The major differences between crystalline and amorphous semiconductors are briefly outlined."
"Evidence for electronic conduction in the preswitching region of chalcogenide glasses is outlined and discussed in terms of several simple models. Electronic processes likely to contribute to the switching process itself are reviewed and compared, where possible, with the predictions of relevant models from conventional semiconductor physics."
"A review of the main features of chalcogenide glass switches is given and interpreted in terms of a thermal runaway mechanism. It is shown that a simple one-dimensional theory is insufficient for describing thin films, and several developments are discussed, including field-dependent effects, channeling instabilities, and electrode hot spots. Suggestions for future work, both theoretical and experimental, that may help to discriminate between thermal and electronic mechanisms are made."
"This paper presents a general description of the xero-graphic photoreceptor and its role in the imaging process. The photoreceptor is described in terms of two properties, the photoinduced charge-generation efficiency and the charge transport through the bulk of the material. The relationships between these fundamental photoreceptor properties and the final electrostatic imaging system are presented for three chalcogenide glasses, Se and As2Se3, which are practical selenium-based photoreceptors, and As2S3, a sulfur-based glass. As2S3is not a practical xerographic material, but a description of its properties is useful for comparison with the Se-based materials."
"The performance of threshold- and memory-switching devices is discussed. The threshold devices were prepared by vacuum deposition from the Ge-As-Te-Si system and exhibited threshold voltages over a wide range from less than 2.0 V to greater than 50 V. Lifetimes of the order of 106-108switching operations before failure were obtained and the operation of the threshold device with a capacitative load was demonstrated. Memory-switching devices were prepared from the Ge-As-Te system. The bistable operation is discussed and it is concluded that the bistable impedance states are due to the presence, or absence, of a crystalline filament between the electrodes. Typical pulse levels required to produce the transition between the impedance states were 2 × 10-2A for 5 × 10-3s and 5 × 10-2A for 5 × 10-6s. The devices possess fairly stable characteristics and currently have lifetimes of 102- 103operations before failure; this is expected to improve with device development."
"The switching delay times for transition metal oxide glass devices vary from operation to operation. However, a statistical treatment of delay time measurements has revealed the voltage dependence of the delay times and the existence of a well-defined threshold voltage for all of the devices tested. The effect of the switch-OFF history on the performance of the devices has also been investigated. Measurements of the transition metal oxide devices are compared with similar work on chalcogenide devices."
"Bistable switching and conduction in niobium-niobium oxide-bismuth devices has been investigated. A number of these devices were found to be stable for more than 106switching cycles and a limited number for more than 109cycles. Upper bounds of 1 and 20 µs for switching from high to low and low to high resistance states, respectively, were observed. Three distinct types of conduction mechanisms are observed in an unformed device. These are the following: 1) the space-charge-limited current flow at high temperatures and low voltages; 2) Poole-Frenkel process at low temperatures and high voltages; and 3) field-assisted tunneling from traps at very low temperatures and high voltages. Conduction in the switching states is found to occur in a singular spot of approximately 2 µ2in area, created while forming. In the high-resistance state an activated process similar to Schottky mechanism seems to be responsible for electrical conduction. The low-resistance state increases very slightly in value on cooling from 300 to 1.6 K, has a small negative resistance \"kink\" in theI-Vcurves at about 0.3 V, and exhibits near ohomic behavior and \"power law\" behavior below and above the kink, respectively."
"A Te-As-Si-Ge thin-film switch has been investigated by pulse program measurements. Switching occurs after a certain delay time, during which the energy necessary for switching is accumulated. Increasing the pressure applied to the devices leads to a decrease of the switching energy. After removal of the voltage, the device will return to the low-conduction state after a recovery time. Two effects are detected: one enables and the other disables the following pulses, if a first pulse with switching has occurred. A current density of 108A/cm2in the high-conduction state probably leads to liquidification of the conduction channel. The device operates more than 1010times without any failure. The diode construction is described."
"The high-speed electron beam heating and the subsequent cooling processes in an amorphous semiconductor target of a beam memory have been studied by computer simulation. Such a memory would utilize the amorphous and the crystalline phases of chalcogenide thin films as the binary states of the memory. For an electron source of 1-µ radius, the results suggest that a storage target, consisting of a chalcogenide thin film whose thickness is twice the electron penetration range on a good heat sinking substrate, is the optimum target configuration. Possible high-speed memory operating characteristics with present long-life high-brightness electron guns are described."
"This paper analyzes the time and space evolution of the current density distribution in an inhomogeneous bulk \"S-shaped\" negative differential conductivity (SNDC) element and the response of the surrounding lumped element circuit. The SNDC element, in series with a package inductance, is in parallel with a package capacitance, the loop being in series with a load resistance and a battery. First the presence of isothermal current density filamentation in SNDC elements is demonstrated. By approximating the SNDC element as an appropriate conductive voltage curve in series with an appropriate intrinsic inductance, it is next shown that various modes of behavior (switching, relaxation oscillations, and a bias induced transition between the two) can all occur in the same SNDC element for appropriate values of the circuit parameters. A major aspect of the circuit theory is that it transforms directly between S and N shaped NDC elements when the important reactive components are identified in each case (duals). The techniques used are applicable to all SNDC elements, such as p-n-p-n and p-i-n diodes, and Ovonic threshold switches; emphasis is placed on the latter."
"A review of application circuits for two-terminal amorphous semiconductor switching devices encompassing both the threshold and memory switches is presented, including brief discussions of device electrical and structural characteristics. The most useful electrical properties of these devices are seen to be the threshold turn-on characteristic and the high on-to-off impedance ratio, in the range 103to 107. Particular emphasis is placed on those applications requiring the versatility of thin-film processing techniques to show feasibility. Also, recent device and circuit developments utilizing a thin-film four-terminal switching structure to obtain input/ output circuit isolation are discussed."
"A special purpose computer intended primarily for use as a terminal multiplexor has been constructed. Program storage for the processor is implemented using an Ovonic read-mostly memory. In addition a bipolar scratchpad memory is implemented for data buffering and status information storage. The processor organization and the Ovonic memory design are discussed. The Ovonic memory is modular in 2048-bit increments to 8192 bits. It has an access time of 70 ns and a cycle time of 125 ns. The processor executes three million instructions per second and can support up to 128 mixed terminal devices with minimum interface circuitry. The ability to alter the program store provides needed flexibility to reconfigure the complement of terminal devices."
"Two specific examples of the application to computer memories of order-disorder transitions in amorphous semiconductors are discussed. The particular physical changes utilized and accompanying the order-disorder transition are a resistance change and an optical change. The resistance change is applied to an electrically alterable Read-Mostly memory (RMM) and the optical change to a laser-alterable mass memory. The characteristics and mechanisms involved in each application are discussed briefly. The unique role of each memory in its respective area of applicability is described. For the RMM, the impact of manufacturing cost on array structure is discussed, and a new improved array of amorphous devices integrated with silicon is disclosed. For the amorphous mass memory, the effect of the interaction between high bit density laser addressing and practical engineering on the physical form of the first mass memory are discussed."

"The model previously proposed by Turner and Wilson is developed in detail and compared with experiment. Deviations from Shockley's classical theory can be accounted for in terms of a single quantity Γ, which is related to Emthe peak field for GaAs. A discussion of the physical mechanism of current saturtation shows that the formation of domains within the channel is hampered in a conventional GaAs FET. Ay-parameter analysis is presented that permits calculation of transconductance and the unity current gain frequency fT. Measurements of drain current, transconductance, and fTversus gate voltage all show good agreement with values predicted by the theory. Estimates are given which show that the current saturation mechanism described will be important in the design of GaAs microwave FET's."
"This paper discusses the device characteristics of the emitter-base junction, linearity of the static forward-current transfer ratio, and excess low-frequency noise in bipolar transistors by use of gate-controlled n-p-n transistors fabricated by varying the deposition rate of phosphosilicate glass in the emitter deposition. As a result of increasing the deposition rate of phosphosilicate glass, the following results were obtained. 1) Diffusion-induced dislocations and emitter edge dislocations extended from the emitter through the collector and their densities increased. 2) Diode reverse current of the emitter-base junction increased. 3) Linearity of the static forward-current transfer ratio was reduced at low current level. 4) Excess low-frequency noise increased."
"A new four-mask \"V-groove\" process for the fabrication of bipolar integrated circuits has been developed. The process utilizes epitaxial ν/n+/n-layers and anisotropic etching of\\langle100\\ranglesilicon to eliminate the buried layer and isolation diffusions as well as the need for masking the base diffusion of the standard six-mask bipolar integrated circuit process, n-p-n transistor, resistor, and Schottky diode characteristics are equivalent to or exceed those of the standard process. A five-mask V-groove process provides improved lateral p-n-p transistors compared with the four-mask approach. The V-groove integrated circuit structure offers simpler processing, smaller isolation capacitances, lower parasitic collector resistances, larger packing densities, and higher junction breakdown voltages than standard bipolar integrated circuits without degradation of other properties."
"An exact three-dimensional solution to the differential equation for steady-state heat transfer in composite media has been derived. Detailed results for 0.050-in-square chips mounted on 1- and 2-in-square substrates show that the thermal resistance of alumina substrates may be expected to increase by as much as 80 percent upon application of a glaze to the surface. The thermal resistances of beam lead chips varying in size from 0.050-to 0.150-in square are determined for chip-substrate interface distances from 0.0005 to 0.002 in, both with and without a thermal conducting compound as the interface media."
"A technique for the fabrication of p-channel MOS transistors and bipolar transistors within monolithic integrated circuits is described. Total process compatibility has been achieved without compromising either the n-p-n bipolar or p-channel MOS characteristics. The technology developed is similar to that used for conventional integrated circuits until the channel oxidation step, A low temperature oxidation followed by a high temperature anneal process that produces negligible changes in preceding diffusion profiles was used to form this oxide. Bias temperature tests of MOS capacitors have shown the oxide to be reproducibly free of contamination. A high slew rate MOS bipolar operational amplifier has been designed and fabricated on 0.045- by 0.045-in chip using the new technology. Typical characteristics are slew rate =80 V/µs voltage gain = 70 dB. The MOS transistors are used as active loads and level shifters in this circuit and provide a much improved frequency response over conventional circuits using p-n-p lateral transistors."
"A two-dimensional three-phase charge-coupled array with 128 × 106 elements, that can serve either as a solid-state image sensor or as an analog serial memory, has been built. As an image sensor the device has been operated successfully in the frame transfer mode to yield 120 frames/s with 64 × 106 resolution elements. By using the whole array as an image sensor, pictures with 128 × 106 resolution elements have been obtained at 15 frames/s with tolerable smearing. In the memory mode the device can store a whole analog frame as produced by a companion device, or 13 568 bits of digital information. But for the latter application defect-free devices are mandatory. The design of the device, the various modes of operation, the quality of the results, some typical defects, and some further applications are discussed."
"The results of pulsed switching experiments and the dcI-Vcharacteristics of thin-oxide (∼20 Å) MNOS devices indicate that the dominant switching mechanism is not necessarily the direct tunneling of electrons to and from states at or near the oxide-nitride interface. Instead, it appears that switching may actually be the result of the tunneling of electrons (holes) from the silicon conduction (valence) band into the nitride conduction (valence) band, with subsequent trapping in the nitride."
"The falloff of transistor gain and cutoff frequency at high currents is a familiar phenomenon. We show here, for the case of transistors having epitaxial collectors, how the mechanism responsible for the falloff depends upon device operating conditions. At any Vcb, a current can be calculated above which falloff begins. If the magnitude of Vcbis lower than a critical value Vcrit, falloff will occur because the transistor enters a saturation or quasi-saturation mode of operation. If the magnitude of Vcbis greater than Vcrit, falloff will occur because the transistor enters a mode of operation associated with space-charge-limited flow. We illustrate the usefulness of this description in understanding observed device behavior, and show how it enables a new interpretation to be given to experimental results previously reported. Important implications for transistor modeling are also discussed."
"Equivalent transmission-line analogs may be developed to advantage for the analysis of noise in bulk semiconductor devices. We discuss first a transmission-line analog for the law of conduction and diffusion of a single species of charge carriers that experience small disturbances from equilibrium. Through the use of Nyquist's theorem it is possible to obtain the power spectra of the noise sources of the equivalent transmission-line circuit at thermal equilibrium. Next, an equivalent circuit can be obtained if there is more than one charge carrier. This circuit is generalized to the case of drifted carriers and applied to the metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) diode and to the small-signal analysis of the Gunn effect. We show how the equivalent circuit for the Gunn effect gives, by inspection, a lower bound on the noise measure achievable with a Gunn diode. We find that the Gunn diode has noise measures exceeding the lower bound. A traveling-wave Gunn device achieves the lower limit."
"The effective length of an MOS transistor can be made narrow by using double diffusion similar to a bipolar transistor. Computations were conducted for an n-channel double-diffused transistor with different surface concentrations, channel lengths, channel gradients, surface-states densities, and substrate concentrations. A shorter channel length and a higher surface-state density, e.g.\\langle1, 1, 1\\ranglecrystal, gave a higher drain current and transconductance. The maximum transconductance in many cases occurs at low gate voltages. The computations indicate that a gain-bandwidth product in the gigahertz range can be expected when the graded channel region is less than 1 µm. The difference between an n-type substrate and a p-type substrate is not substantial. The analysis is also useful in predicting the performance of any integrated logic circuit using the diffused enhancement transistor as the active switch and a depletion-mode transistor (without a diffused channel) as the load device. The computation indicates that satisfactory performance can be obtained using a load device with the same geometry and an ON voltage of only a fraction of a volt, This revelation indicates that double-diffused channel MOS transistors not only give higher speed but also smaller chip area for integrated circuits and a lower supply voltage (hence less power dissipation)."

"The general transport equations in a heavy doped semiconductor are given, taking the position-dependent band structure into account. An intrinsic concentration depending on the doping levels is introduced. This quantity allows us to use the classical equations in a slightly modified form, if Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics can be applied for one or both kinds of the carrier. The total density of states in a heavy doped semiconductor is assumed to be the envelope of the density of states of the conduction (valence) band and impurity band. The effect of the skewness of the impurity band is included. The Fermi level and the effective intrinsic carrier concentration are calculated for this total density of states function. Experimental evidence for the calculated values is given."
"It is shown that the radiation emitted at breakdown from large-area high-voltage p-n junctions and from p-n-p structures can be detected using an infrared image converter in conjunction with a three-stage image intensifier. In the example given, the patterns of the emitted light consist of segments of circles and spirals, indicating an inhomogeneous breakdown across the area. The inhomogeneous breakdown is attributed to resistivity striations inside the silicon. The infrared radiation emitted from the p-n-p structure was more intense by approximately one order of magnitude than that of the p-n junction, the additional emission being recombination radiation generated in front of the forward-biased emitter."
"Space-charge dynamics in semiconductors with negative differential mobility are discussed in a small-signal approximation taking account of the role of carrier diffusion and are shown to exhibit fundamentally four different properties. These differences originate from two conditions, one being the direction of propagation of the space-charge wave and the other being whether the space-charge wave is characterized by frequency-independent velocity (convective instability) or frequency-independent wavelength (absolute instability). These behaviors of space-charge waves have a great influence on the performance of bulk-effect devices and give rise to extremely different characteristics. When the space-charge wave is characterized by frequency-independent velocity, two-terminal impedance of bulk-effect devices shows the conventional transit-time effect. On the contrary, the property of space-charge waves characterized by frequency-independent wavelength gives rise to the static negative resistance in two-terminal impedance."
"Techniques of fabricating an n-channel silicon field-effect transistor using phosphorus ion implantation and a platinum silicide Schottky-barrier gate (SB-FET) have been developed. The platinum silicide Schottky-barrier top gate is part of the contact metallization process. The phosphorus-doped channel is obtained by using a 50-keV ion-implanted predeposition and an 1100°C drive-in. A range of implantation doses and drive-in times were used to achieve various SB-FET characteristics. A threshold/pinchoff voltage range of +0.4 to -7.5 V has been obtained with typical spreads of approximately 0.1 V across the slice. A positive threshold voltage represents a SB-FET that is normally off and is turned on by a forward-biased gate. Results have been obtained for <100> oriented boron-doped silicon substrates. The advantages of these techniques, which include fabrication simplicity, tight distributions of characteristics, and the ability to achieve various threshold/pinchoff voltages by implantation dose adjustments, are discussed."
"Cold cathode emission has been obtained from forward-biased silicon p-n junctions whose p-surfaces were activated to a state of negative electron affinity. In operation, electrons injected into the p-layer diffuse to the surface where they are emitted into vacuum. An Si:SiO2structure has been developed to overcome the problems associated with current crowding, and with this structure, efficiencies (ratio of emitted current to bias current) as high as 10 percent have been observed. Emitted current densities as large as 225 A/cm2and currents as large as 7 mA have been drawn under pulsed conditions, while continuous current densities of 2 A/cm2and currents of tens of microamperes have been drawn for many hours. The electrical characteristics exhibited space-charge-limited and emission-limited regimes as well as Schottky effect. The silicon cold cathode has advantages in applications such as vidicons, where some aspects of performance are presently limited by the thermionic cathode, and where power consumption and heat generation must be minimized."
"It is shown that in a model of a bipolar transistor with a rectangular configuration, the base-crowding effect may be represented by a diode and a resistor in parallel between the internal base point and the external base connection with an accuracy of better than four percent."
"New data from special bipolar junctions that breakdown below the Si-SiO2interface are described. The devices were broken down both in a dc and pulse fashion, and junction degradation in the form of increased reverse leakage and reduced minority carrier lifetime was investigated. No degradation was observed."

"An ITT type FW118 photomultiplier tube biased by using a high-voltage power supply and a resistor chain was found experimentally to have output noise spectra decreasing in magnitude as frequency increases, resembling in shape the 1/fnoise spectrum. This lowering of the noise level as frequency increases was explained in terms of: 1) the shunting effect of the interelectrode impedance and the stray capacitances of the last stage, and 2) the gain fluctuation of the photomultiplier tube caused by the noise voltage developed across each biasing resistor. A method of flattening the noise spectra and improving the frequency response of the tube is also given in this paper."
"A new method for investigating the field distribution near the surface of p-n junctions is presented. The results show that for negatively beveled junctions, an absolute field maximum exists underneath the surface. This field maximum rather than the field on the surface determines the breakdown voltage of the device. The dependency of the maximum field on various device parameters as base resistivity, bevel angle, and steepness of the doping profile is analyzed. In addition, the influence of surface charges and dielectrics is investigated. Finally, the advantages of positive bevel angles with respect to negative ones are demonstrated. The theoretical results were verified by potential probing measurements on the surface of high-voltage devices."
"The power density distribution in the avalanche zone of a TRAPATT-diode is approximated by a rectangular pulse in order to consider it as a source function in the heat equation. Heat generation is considered to be periodic, and the dissipation is taken with a thermal time constant larger than the period. The increase in frequency needs a decrease in depletion width, improving the thermal conduction to the heat sink. The power density needed increases with frequency, thus raising the maximum temperature in the depletion region with frequency. The criteria for the best performance is that the two processes of heat generation and conduction to the heat sink are to be so adjusted as to lead to a mininum rise in temperature. The steady state temperature rise in CW operation comes out to beR_{TH} \\cdot P_{I} \\cdot W_{ASF}/v_{z} \\cdot f, while in the pulsed case this expression is related to the maximum temperature. The maximum temperature allowable in the depletion region should be lower than that required for any failure to occur. Using these criteria the thermal limitations for CW and pulsed operations of the TRAPATT diode have been analyzed."
"A silicon vidicon that uses an n on p silicon diode array for a target was designed. The electron beam landing energy is 600 eV, and all the diodes are charged to a reversed bias by secondary electron emission. With the high electron beam energy, it is possible to sharply focus the beam into a sheet beam, which can be used to simultaneously bombard several separate linear diode arrays in a detector scheme for a bent-crystal X-ray spectrometer. By such a method, the bandwidth requirement of the data-transmission system is reduced by a factor equal to the number of separate linear arrays that are simultaneously bombarded. Data are presented on the diode-charging mechanism, with emphasis on the method used to determine the potential of the diode n-surface. Examples are shown of the tube being used to detect 25-keV X-rays."
"We estimate the ultimate noise of Gunn oscillators in the absence of 1/fnoise. The basic noise source considered is thermal or Johnson noise augmented by intervalley noise of carriers hopping between the high and low mobility bands. For example, for Qext= 102and Pout=10-1W we estimate δfrms≈ 1-2 Hz, and AM noise relative to the carrier of -156 dD, both measured in 1-kHz bandwidths."
"An analytical investigation supported by numerical calculations has been performed of the stable field profile in a supercritical diffusion-stabilized n-GaAs transferred electron amplifier (TEA) with ohmic contacts. In the numerical analysis, the field profile is determined by solving the steady-state continuity and Poisson equations. The diffusion-induced short-circuit stability is checked by performing time-domain computer simulations under constant voltage conditions. The analytical analysis based on simplifying assumptions gives the following results in good agreement with the numerical results. 1) A minimum doping level required for stability exists, which is inversely proportional to the field-independent diffusion coefficient assumed in the simple analysis. 2) The dc current is bias independent and below the threshold value, and the current drop ratio increases slowly and almost linearly with the doping level. 3) The domain width normalized to the diode lengthLvaries almost linearly with(V_{B}/V_{T}-1)^{\\frac{1}{2}}/(n_{0}L)^{\\frac{1}{2}}where VBis the bias voltage VTis the threshold voltage, and no is the doping level. 4) The peak domain field varies almost linearly with (V_{B}/V_{T}-1)^{\\frac{1}{2}} (n_{0}L)^{\\frac{1}{2}}. Those results contribute to the understanding of the highn_{0}L-product switch and the stability of the supercritical TEA."
"Doping profiles can be measured to best advantage by using MIS capacitors when one is interested in the profile either very close to the semiconductor surface or in very heavily doped semiconductors. This paper shows both experimentally and theoretically that the major error caused by interface states can be minimized by using either the pulsed capacitance voltage technique or by the second-harmonic profiling technique. This makes possible profile measurements in MIS capacitors even with very large interface state densities, and makes it advantageous to use MIS capacitors for the express purpose of profile measurements. The minimization of interface state errors is contingent upon using a high enough measurement frequency. Moreover, the closer to the interface that the profile is desired, the higher the frequency must be. At high enough frequencies, the intrinsic resolution of the method allows accurate measurement of the doping profile only to within a few extrinsic Debye lengths of the Si-SiO2interface. Curves are presented indicating the closeness to the interface attainable within a 2 percent profile error as a function of measurement frequency, doping level, and temperature. Comparison of experimental measurements with theory on uniformly doped samples at 5 and 30 MHz substantiates our analysis of interface state effects. Finally, a nonuniform profile is measured to illustrate the method."
"In modeling bipolar transistors the charge-control concept provides a means to predict dynamic behavior from a detailed knowledge of the steady state. As such, it is a first-order approximation lacking accuracy. It is shown that a considerable improvement can be obtained when the concept is extended by allowing time delays in the relations between controlling charges and terminal voltages and currents. It suffices to introduce two delays whose magnitudes can be determined or estimated from the steady-state solution. The increased range of validity of the extended charge-control model is demonstrated in detail, by confronting it with a rigorous model and comparing small-signal parameters."
"A large-signal analysis of a Read-type IMPATT diode is carried out with a sinusoidal current as the excitation. The results are compared with analyses that assume a sinusoidal voltage excitation. The large-signal impedance of the diode with current excitation is expressed in closed form. The circuit implications of choosing voltage or current as the excitation are discussed."
"The fabrication technology for a high-power monolithic IC improved the breakdown characteristics and the output current capability. The maximum output power increased to 50 W and the supplied voltage of 110 V was realized. Highly doped polycrystalline Si was used as the collector walls and the isolation walls of transistors. Electrical and physical properties of the polycrystalline structure used in the power IC and the fabrication technology are also described."
"The operation of avalanche transit-time devices at or near their output saturation point is often accompanied by instabilities and a deterioration of the spectral purity of the output signal. This can be attributed to a number of nonlinear effects that give rise to additional static or dynamic negative resistance. Depending on the external RF and bias circuit conditions, spurious oscillations, discontinuities, and quasi-random modulation of the carrier due to non-linear signal interaction can result. Prior to the onset of instabilities, low-frequency avalanche-noise components are selectively amplified, up-converted, and appear as noise sidebands of the output signal. These effects and their dependence on external circuit conditions are examined with the aid of a computer, simulation program. The features of this particular program are high computational speeds flexibility in the assumption of input data, and the inclusion of random noise in the simulation. The results of the computations are compared with analytical expressions and experiment. It is shown that the basic excess noise contribution at high signal levels stems from the \"buildup\" noise of the avalanche and increases approximately inversely proportional to the conduction current minimum. Instabilities are due to negative resistance components induced either by parametric signal interaction or rectification effects of the diode. Under high-power operation the spectrum of negative induced resistance extends from dc to the transit-time signal frequency. Strong parametric oscillations occur at subharmonic frequencies of the output signal while the period of dc block oscillations is primarily determined by the growth rate of the RF signal and the time constants of the external circuit elements. Under unfavorable bias and RF circuit conditions the initiation of lower frequency instabilities can lead to very high peaks of the current-density that are believed to be the cause of the frequently observed \"anomalous\" burnout of high-power diodes. The deterioration of the noise performance and stability at low temperatures results from the combined effect of the temperature dependence of effective reverse saturation currents and breakdown field. An example of a simple TRAPATT oscillator simulation is given and it is shown that the AM and FM noise spectra depend strongly on the magnitude of the minority saturation currents."
"The approximate theory of the diffused-junction p-L-n rectifier, as developed in Part II of this series [2], is extended to include the realistic situation where the number of recombination centers in the diffused region can be much greater than that in the base region. The proposed extension employs the same analytical model for the diffused junction as in Part II, but uses a different approach in its treatment of the effective base region. By comparison with exact numerical solutions, the validity of the theory is established for a representative high-power silicon single-diffused n+-p-p+structure operating under high-level conditions. Some possible applications of the theory are considered."
"An optimization procedure is developed that completely specifies the one-dimensional design of a double-diffused transistor with only two pieces of input data required--the collector-emitter sustaining voltage and the current gain required when the device is operating in the region of quasi-saturation. A simple but experimentally validated model for predicting hFEversus ICis also developed and used in the optimization procedure. The analysis is intended to apply mainly to the case of high-voltage high-current switching transistors that have a lightly doped collector. Several design examples are given that illustrate the optimization procedure. In the first example it is shown that the emitter area can be minimized, while simultaneously meeting both the HFEand BVCEOspecifications. This result is of economic significance, since it results in the minimization of die size, and hence die cost. Other examples are given that illustrate various extensions of the procedure."
"Experimental results obtained with developmental electron beam-semiconductor devices used as video-pulse and RF pulsed amplifiers are discussed. These devices employ a grid-modulated electron beam to control the current in a semiconductor target. Power gains of 26 dB and peak pulse powers of 40 W were obtained at up to 600 MHz with an untuned output impedance of 20 Ω. Peak powers in excess of 30 W were obtained at 600 MHz with a 50-Ω load. Power gains of 20 dB were obtained at up to 860 MHz for both output impedances. Also described is the performance of a video-pulse amplifier with a peak power of 2 kW and a rise time of 2 ns. The experimental results are compared to the theoretically predicted values. A problem of diode deterioration encountered with these developmental devices is discussed and solutions to the problem are presented. The reverse breakdown characteristic of both nonpassivated mesa diodes and silicon dioxide passivated planar diodes using \"p on n\" material decreased by over 50 percent during the first few hours of operation. \"p on n\" diodes with phosphorous glass over the silicon dioxide have been operated up to 59 h with little deterioration, and a planar diode with \"n on p\" construction has been operated satisfactorily for 1000 h."
"This paper describes the design and testing of developmental electron-bombarded semiconductor (EBS) devices as pulsed dc and pulsed RF amplifiers. These devices employ a well-focused electron beam deflected in proportion to the input signal to control the current in a semiconductor target. Both Class A and Class B amplifier configurations are described, with a prediction of their relative efficiency and distortion properties. The deflection sensitivity of simple deflection plates and traveling-wave deflection systems is considered. Experimental results are given for amplifiers with planar passivated semiconductor targets and traveling-wave deflection systems operated as video-pulsed amplifiers and Class B RF amplifiers. Performance of nanosecond-risetime videopulse amplifiers with peak output power greater than 700 W and efficiency in excess of 80 percent is described. Test data are presented from RF amplifiers with efficiency performance of 60 percent. A comparison of theoretical and experimental results is given based upon a computer simulation of semiconductor target performance. Preliminary life test data showing stabilized diode performance with negligible reverse breakdown voltage deterioration are presented."
"This paper begins with a brief description of the basic electrical characteristics and principles of operation of the lumped-element electron-beam-excited-semiconductor amplifier. It is shown that stable current gains of several thousand may be obtained through the interaction of a 10-keV electron beam with a shallow reverse-biased p-n junction device (semiconductor target). Simplest case analyses of the transient-response rise time and RF gain and bandwidth are presented for an idealized nondistributed target structure, using the assumptions of shallow beam penetration across the drift region, carrier transport with a constant velocity, and a resistive load impedance. The dynamic response is shown to be determined jointly by the carrier transit time and the target capacitance in such a way that it is possible to optimize the target rise time or bandwidth by appropriate choices of drift-region width. The optimum drift-region width and the ultimate rise times and bandwidths are evaluated in terms of the target area, load impedance, carrier drift velocity, and semiconductor dielectric constant. It is shown that lumped-element semiconductor targets can readily be designed for subnanosecond rise times and broad bandwidths without compromise of the high current gain possible in these devices."
"We calculate the spectral density of the noise added to an analog signal passed through a charge transfer device (CTD) in terms of the charge fluctuation associated with each transfer. A correlation between noise in neighboring elements substantially suppresses the energy content of the noise associated with charge transfer for frequencies much less than the clock frequency."
"Observed effects of lateral surface generation on the MOS-C C-t transient and linear-sweep C-VGcharacteristics are noted and explained in terms of a qualitative model that emphasizes the heretofore ignored role of outer oxide surface ions. It is suggested that the lateral generation component is functionally more complex than previously conceived, and that this fact can lead to erroneous conclusions in the interpretation of deep depletion data."
"The distribution of the emitter current density along the emitter stripe in the comb structure has been analytically obtained by taking into account the junction temperature and the sheet resistance of the diffused base layer, From this result the optimum length of the emitter stripe has been obtained."

"This paper describes an extension of the well-known self-registered gate PMOS technology for fabricating complementary MOS (CMOS) transistors. Exclusive usage of doped silane oxides as diffusion sources provides accurate and repeatable control of the n-channel-threshold voltage. The use of doped-oxide diffusion sources also makes possible a novel diffusion technique where the n- and p-channel source and drain diffusions can be performed simultaneously with independent control of sheet resistivity. This technique eliminates one high-temperature operation; at the same time, the doped-oxide diffusion sources can be deposited in such a manner as to allow their differing etch rates to provide favorable slopes on the edges of contact windows, a feature that increases yield and reliability. A description of the process is provided along with an electrical characterization of the devices fabricated using this process."
"The threshold voltage of the field regions of p-channel Si gate devices can be controllably increased by phosphorus ion implantation prior to field oxidation without any additional masking step. For a 1.25-µ field oxide thickness, an increase of more than 20 V in intermediate field threshold can be achieved without lowering junction breakdown voltage."
"Five different modes of high-field domains due to the field-dependent diffusion coefficient in a material with negative differential mobility (NDM) are discussed. Two of them are periodically traveling domain modes whose traveling directions are opposite each other. The remainder are trapped domain modes and are classified by the positions where the domains are trapped. For a bulk-effect device operated in the trapped domain mode, the static negative resistance (SNR) appears in its current-voltage characteristic."
"A p+-n(+)-n-n+just punchthrough IMPATT structure is proposed and analyzed. This high-low junction structure differs from the Read structure in that the carrier concentration in the n-layer is high enough that the breakdown and punchthrough occur at the same time; yet it differs with the regular p+-n junction structure in that an additional n(+)-layer with prescribed carrier concentration and layer thickness is present. Tradeoffs between the efficiency and noise of this high-low junction IMPATT are presented and compared to the case of a conventional p-n junction IMPATT. It is shown that either the efficiency or noise performance can be improved, although one at the expense of the other. As an example, the maximum efficiency of a high-low junction IMPATT is improved from about 23 to 30 percent at the expense of a degradation in noise performance of 7 dB. On the other hand, the noise of an X-band diode can be improved by 6 dB with a degradation in efficiency from 23 to 12 percent. This structure should be useful for high-efficiency high-power applications where the noise specifications can be relaxed, or as local oscillators where the noise performance is important."
"A phase-sensitive detection scheme is described that allows the equivalent circuit of semiconductor diodes to be determined over a wide range of operating conditions. Under reverse bias, a direct plot may be obtained of the bias dependence of the exhaustion region width through impedance measurements. In the forward sense, the diode admittance may be measured even when large currents are flowing through the diode. The capability of the method, both to yield valuable information regarding physical conditions at the junction of the device and to give insight into the charge-transport mechanisms at the interface, is illustrated through a series of measurements on selenium rectifiers."
"Computer simulation results show that optimum dc to RF conversion efficiency is in descending order for Schottky-barrier GaAs, p+-n Si, and n+-p Si IMPATT diodes."
"This paper presents an insight into the transient performance and propagation delay of complex integrated multiple-input structures in relation to a large digital system, taking into account the intrinsic parameters associated with device geometry. Modeling is therefore performed at the gate level. A piecewise linear model is used for the various transient intervals and the analysis employs fixed time steps. Experimental observations give ample evidence of good agreement between the theoretical and computed results, for which various values of input rise and fall times and different values of fan-out, β0, and fTare used. An accurate appraisal of the storage time associated with the gate is thus possible. Detailed solutions determine the main factors that offer scope for improvement for the structure studied, and suggest means of optimizing the transient response using the derived analytical expressions."
"Statements in the above paper1regarding quantitative agreement between theory and experiment are elaborated on, and a simplified graphical method for calculating the lifetime is presented."
 "The most commonly used diffusion process in planar technology is known as two-step diffusion, and the impurity atom profile is given by an integral. An approximation is suggested for such a profile which is simpler and accurate enough to be used in device characterization. It is seen that the built-in field resulting from two-step diffusion can be approximated as linearly varying with distance."
"The phase-locking characteristics of an LSA-mode transferred-electron-effect diode oscillator in a microwave circuit are studied by time domain computer simulations. The fundamental generated power and the fundamental efficiency are plotted as functions of the locking signal power at fundamental frequency, and also as functions of the locking signal power at twice the fundamental frequency."
"It is proposed that the numberN*, given byN*=4ab[\\int\\min{0}\\max{\\infin}T(f) df]^{2}, is equal to the number of picture elements in an image within which the noise-free modulation transfer functionT(f)of the image device (display) is uniform and isotropic;aandbare the edge lengths (mm) of a rectangular format, andfis the spatial frequency (cycles/mm). An equation forN*, that applies to nonuniform and anisotropic modulation transfer functions is also given. A picture element transfer efficiencyE*is defined as (N*/N*'), whereN*'is the number of picture elements transferred to the image (display) by an \"ideal\" device."
"Recently, the depletion-type IGFET became widely used as a load device in logic circuits. The purpose of this correspondence is to present a development of the current-voltage characteristic of a depletion-type IGFET based on the assumption that the non-linear semiconductor capacitance can be replaced by a constant average capacitance. This approximation is justified in light of the theoretical and experimental results obtained by many authors [1]-[4], indicating that the exact form of the semiconductor capacitance has little effect on the dc characteristics of a field-effect device."

"Noise characterization of a set of epitaxially grown p-n-junction GaAs IMPATTS that operate efficiently from 26-35 GHz is reported. In oscillator operation, the diodes exhibit an excess noise near the carrier, which follows a 1/fdependence. Far from the carrier an AM DSB SNR of 134 dB in a 100-Hz window and an FM noise measure of 36 dB are observed. As a reflection amplifier, a gain of 22 dB with a 250-MHz bandwidth and a noise figure of 25.5 dB is achieved. Under higher gain conditions (28-dB gain) a 24-dB figure is obtained."
"The new grating-type Au-n-type Si Schottky-barrier photodiode has been fabricated and analyzed. The device is constructed with a new structure of contact mask. The mask forms a grating of gold film over the contacting silicon substrate. The grating spacing is so chosen that even at zero bias the interfacial layer between the silicon substrate and the gold gratings is completely depleted. The device is fabricated on an n-type silicon wafer of ∼1300-Ω.cm resistivity, and the grating spacing is 12.5 µm. An analysis is performed to determine the I-V characteristics, the spectral dependence of the quantum yield, the responsivity, and the noise characteristics of the photodiode. It is found that without optimization the device has a bandwidth of ∼1 GHz and responsivity of 0.63 A/W at λ =0.9 µm."
"A model has been developed for the computation of forward second breakdown due to lateral thermal instability in power transistors. The method of analysis is to derive the steady-state current density and temperature distribution of a given transistor design under specified operating conditions, and then to calculate the response of the device to a temperature impulse suddenly applied internally. The current flow calculations have been carried out by using a distributed transistor model, and for the time-dependent heat flow problem the finite difference approach was used. The effect of device design parameters such as chip thickness, base width, emitter width, base impurity concentration, etc., on the thermal stability has been calculated. Also, the effect on transistor stability of the current and voltage operating point, as well as the heat sink temperature, has been analyzed. Information on the stability of a power transistor under pulsed condition is derived by calculating the time constant for thermal runaway. The results of this analysis indicate that the delay time is of the order of 1 ms."
"Solid-state imaging devices to be used in commercial broadcast TV or the Picturephone® system have to supply the video information in a 2:1 interlaced timing format. An efficient way to achieve such a readout from charge-coupled area imaging devices of the frame transfer type is described. The resolution cells of the device are elongated in the vertical dimension to extend across the distance corresponding to two scanning lines in the display. For the two fields forming a full frame the charge generated by the incident light is integrated alternately underneath different sets of electrodes. Experimental results obtained on a 64 × 106 element frame transfer array are presented and compared to theory. They show that in a three-phase structure, by alternately integrating the charge underneath electrodes number 1 and numbers 2+3 jointly, the vertical resolution can be improved by about a factor of 2. This results in a limiting resolution in the vertical direction of about 75 percent of that given by the spatial pitch of the transfer cells. The value 75 percent is characteristic of all raster scanned imaging devices and is a result of the line scanned display. The usefulness of this scheme for line imaging devices is also discussed but is dismissed as being inferior to a bilinear approach with separate interdigitated integration sites."
"The efficiency and noise of p+n1n2n+GaAs IMPATT diodes have been studied as functions of the doping ratio n1/n2(when n1=n2we have a conventional abrupt p-n junction). For n1/n2>1 there are tradeoffs between efficiency and noise. At 12 GHz, for example, with a ratio of 4 the efficiency is 25 percent and the noise measure is 3 dB higher then that of a conventional IMPATT diode."
"A large-signal analysis is used to discuss the effect of lattice temperature and temperature gradients on the RF behavior of stabilized transferred-electron devices. The influence of the value of donor density and density gradients upon RF conversion efficiency is also discussed. It is shown that efficiency can be improved if either the heat sink is located at the anode or the donor density is increased near the anode end."
"The design of high-voltage p-n-junction devices used today is usually based on beveling of the p-n junctions in order to reduce the tangential surface field far enough below the bulk field and to secure thus that breakdown occurs in the bulk of the device rather than at the surface. Using relaxation methods, solutions of Poisson's equation in two dimensions have been found which reveal that for commonly used bevelings of the forward-blocking junction in a thyristor structure, the electric field in the region below the surface is larger than in the bulk and at the surface. This field is strongly dependent on surface charges. It is shown that bevelings avoid the surface breakdown but the body breakdown obtained is not the true bulk breakdown as expected but rather occurs in the immediate neighborhood to the surface. The calculations make it possible to obtain the breakdown voltage for beveled structures. Measurements of the tangential surface field obtained by probing the junctions, light-spot measurements of the space-charge-region width on the surface and capacitance measurements of the surface charge as well as breakdown measurements are in good agreement with the calculations. This approach has led to the design of high-voltage thyristor structures that exhibit true bulk breakdown and, at the same time, loss of semiconducting material due to beveling is reduced."
"In a simple memory application the threshold voltage VTof an MNOS transistor is switched by means of write and erase pulses of opposite polarities between two levels, representing logical ONEs and ZEROs. It is shown that by isolating the source and drain during the write pulse, the magnitude of the VTshift can be made dependent on the intensity of light on the MNOS device. By choosing the light intensity and the width of the write pulse properly, the device can be made to operate in either a digital or analog mode. The theory of this effect, applicable to both transistors and capacitors, is developed by generalizing the well-understood behavior of the MNOS memory device to include conduction in the silicon space-charge region. The operation of the device depends on the current-field relationships for the nitride, oxide, and silicon space-charge layers. It is shown how these three functions may be obtained from steady-state I-V measurements on the MNOS device. Good agreement is found between experimental and calculated charging curves for both transistors and capacitors."
"Physical mechanisms are proposed for avalanche oscillations in n+-n-n+semiconductor structures. A linearized analysis is proposed for these mechanisms, the results of which agree well with the results of a large-signal computer simulation. The oscillation mechanism is dependent upon a large excess electron concentration that is present at high current levels in the n region of an n+-n-n+structure. This electron concentration causes a net negative space charge in the n region, which in turn causes the electric field to be nonuniform, peaking at the anode n+contact. At sufficiently high current densities, an avalanche zone will form at the anode contact. The resultant carrier generation in this zone creates a hole domain of density sufficient to quench the avalanche. This hole domain then travels across the n region under the influence of the field. The positive space charge of the hole domain depresses the field sufficiently to prevent avalanche from recurring at the anode until the domain has extracted at the cathode. The field variation during this cycle causes transit-time terminal voltage oscillations. It is shown how, under proper conditions, a steady-state plasma region may be established over a substantial portion of the device length. This plasma region will cause the device to exhibit a negative differential resistance, and will also support relaxation oscillations at a frequency comparable to the reciprocal of its extraction time."
"The development of a modeling technique for bipolar devices is described. The application of the technique results in complete and realistic large-signal models which are amenable to computer-aided analysis. SCEPTRE has been used to effectively analyze derived models, and results of SCEPTRE analyses of a developed transistor model are presented to illustrate the general capabilities of the modeling technique and to indicate the efficiency with which the resulting models are handled by SCEPTRE. The models are structured such that systematic modifications in model complexity can be effected to reflect refinements in the states of the art of device processing and analysis, as well as to efficiently satisfy the user's model capability requirements."
"As originally postulated by Ridley, bulk media exhibiting isothermal current-controlled negative differential conductivity (NDC) are shown to be unstable with respect to small fluctuations in the current density, leading to current density filamentation. In contrast to Ridley's arguments, however, we describe and elucidate the instability in terms of internal-induced magnetic flux. We show that Lenz's law does not apply to NDC points."
"A simple injection-locking experiment for oscillator characterization is demonstrated. The measurements confirm theoretical treatments of injection locking."
 "A novel waveguide Gunn oscillator circuit is described that permits wide-band mechanical and electronic (varactor) tuning. A feature of the circuit is that a circuit model can be devised that accurately predicts the oscillator characteristics and that, therefore, can be used to formulate a realistic oscillator design procedure."
"An approximate analytic solution of the Bethe equation for the mean rate of energy loss is derived. This solution is found to deviate by less than one percent from the numerical integration of the Bethe equation for all values of electron path. It is also shown that when the energy-path length relation is expressed in normalized variables, it exhibits only a very weak dependence on material and initial energy."
"Recent n-GaAs experiments and computer simulations have demonstrated that amplification from \"supercritical\" negative differential mobility (NDM) semiconductors is dependent on the shape of the dc stable electric field versus distance profile. For a specific nonuniform field profile, where a partially depleted charge layer is adjacent to the cathode, we show that small-signal amplification from 10-µ-long 1015/cm3NDM elements is 1) dependent upon conditions at the cathode boundary, 2) dc bias dependent, 3) arises from a subcritical region of the element, and 4) has a frequency band for small-signal negative resistance that is determined by the transit time of the carriers across the depleted region."
"The impurity redistribution in silicon substrates of MOSFET's is estimated from the measurement of dc voltage-current characteristics using the exact theory of the effect of substrate bias. The usefulness of the present method depends upon the acceptability of substituting the Fermi potential before thermal treatments for that after thermal treatments, which then allows for the direct calculation of the impurity concentration. The accuracy of the present method is given theoretically by the discussion of relative errors."

"Some organic semiconducting polymers have a resistivity that varies to a great extent with temperature. Thin membranes made from these suitably doped materials are covered with a coating that absorbs infrared radiation, thus constituting targets for image pickup tubes of the Vidicon type operating at room temperature. After a theoretical approach to the electrothermal properties of such targets, the preparation and experimental results are reported."
"Analytic expressions for axial and radial electric fields in axisymmetric interaction gaps of klystrons and coupled-cavity traveling-wave tubes are derived. Introduction of a field-shape parametermallows a continuous transition in gap-edge field distribution between the limit of a uniform constant field for relatively blunt tunnel tips to the limit of a field rising to infinity with infinitely sharp tunnel tips. With values ofm = 0andm = \\infincorresponding to these limits, intermediate values of m yield field distributions that very closely approximate the actual field distributions occurring in interaction gaps. A comparison is made between the analytically computed field distribution and the field distribution obtained by experimental measurement and by relaxation computation in a klystron cavity."
"It is shown that an interdigital electrode structure situated near a semiconductor surface may exhibit negative conductance if the drift velocity of the charge carriers in the semiconductor is sufficiently large. The conditions for obtaining this negative conductance are derived, and these theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results obtained for an interdigital electrode structure situated on an oxidized silicon surface. Negative conductance is observed in the frequency range from 25 to 75 MHz at a temperature of about 25 K, and the experimental data show good agreement with the theory. Finally the specific properties of different device geometries are considered with a view to the possibilities of operation at room temperature and at higher frequencies."
"In the calculation of the turn-on probabilities per unit time of avalanche diode microplasmas, or of the single-photon detection probabilities of avalanche photodiodes used in the photon-counting mode, it is desirable to know how the avalanche initiation probability varies with voltage above the breakdown voltage. It is shown that the two coupled differential equations derived by Oldham et al. for the probabilities that a self-sustaining avalanche will be initiated in an avalanche diode biased above the breakdown voltage by an injected electron or by an injected hole (avalanche initiation probabilities) can be combined to provide a single integral equation for each of the electron, hole, and electron-hole pair initiation probabilities. These equations can be integrated for the special case in which the electron and hole ionization rates αeand αhare related by\\alpha_{h} \\approx k\\alpha_{e}wherekis a constant. A method of computing an effective value ofkfor other cases in which this approximation is not a good one is presented. The resulting expressions are shown to be consistent with previously published calculations by McIntyre of the breakdown probabilities both for the casek = 1and for the more general casek \\neq 1."
"The influence of As surface concentration CSEon the emitter efficiency βγand the temperature dependence of βγare reported. The theoretical model that is used to explain the variation of βγwith CSEis based upon the difference in the effective energy bandgaps in the emitter and base regions\\DeltaE_{g}. Experimental measurements of\\DeltaE_{g}versus CSEare presented. Measurements of βγversus CSEshow that the effective emitter doping densityQ_{E}/x_{eb}reaches a maximum value atC_{SE} \\cong 1.5 \\times 10^{20}atoms/cm3, corresponding to the threshold above which\\DeltaE_{g} > 0. For the case of a constant active base doping/cm2QB, this also corresponds to an optimum in the emitter efficiency βγ. However, it is shown that in typical sequential diffusion processing of transistors, βγincreases monotonically with CSEbecauseQ_{B} = Q_{B}(C_{SE})decreases. In addition, for devices fabricated in this study,\\Delta\\beta_{\\gamma}/\\DeltaC_{SE}atC_{SE}=2 \\times 10^{20}atoms/ cm3for As-diffused emitters (doped oxide) was ≈ 5 times greater than for ion-implanted-diffused As emitters, showing the superiority of implantation in controlling gain. Finally, transistors that were made withC_{SE} \\siml 1.4 \\times 10^{20}atoms/cm3(\\DeltaE_{g} = 0) showed βgamma(85°C)/ βγ(-15°C) ≤ 1.05."
"This paper describes the operation of a p-π-p structure with injecting contact in a mode similar to that of an equivalent p-n-p bipolar transistor. Minority carrier injection takes place from an adjacent n-type layer. Such structures occur in Tri-mask (TRIM) integrated circuits, for example. Because of the low doping in the π region, high injection level effects occur virtually at the onset of conduction (current densities > 10 mA/cm2). The π region is then divided into two regions, a low-field region and a high-field region. Overall behavior is similar to that of a normal bipolar transistor, the plasma behaving as an injected base layer, the high-field region behaving as the usual base-collector depletion region (output space). An appropriate closed-form solution is derived that gives physical insight into the operation of the structure. It gives gain (and base transit time) results identical in form to those for transistors at high-level injection. A more complete computer analysis of specific structures gave results consistent with the approximate model. The physical picture of TRIM transistors that results from this model indicates that for both gain and frequency response of these transistors, the collector voltage is an important parameter for a given collector current and width of π region. This study, motivated by TRIM structures, is more generally applicable as a one-dimensional analysis of any high-injection bipolar transistor operating in the active mode."
"Frequency cutoff for GaAs varactor diodes of diffused-P+-n-epitaxial n+-substrate construction can be plotted so as to conveniently show dependence of diode cutoff as measured at 10 GHz on diode n-region thickness and substrate resistivity. The measured data fit a model for the diode where the zero bias junction capacitanceC_{j0}is in series with a junction resistance Rjthat is proportional to1/C_{j0}, and a resistance RXthat is constant. Rjis the resistance of the diode n-region and the p+-diffused region, and is primarily dependent on the n-region thickness. RXis dependent on diode spreading resistance, and varies with substrate resistivity. RXis about 1 Ω for usual substrate material."
"The experimental determination of defect density distributions is described. These distributions are needed for calculating LSI yields. The defect densities appear to be distributed according to gamma distributions. An expression for the average yield for a semiconductor process is derived based on the results."

"Closed-form expressions are derived for total thickness of the depletion region and thickness of the depletion region on the n side of the junction. The expressions are applicable to n-p junction devices with either complementary error function or Gaussian impurity distributions. Depletion region thicknesses obtained by evaluation of the closed-form expressions are in excellent agreement with exact numerical calculations."
"An oblique electron lens is described that is especially applicable to image converters and camera tubes employing flat opaque photocathodes. The use of optical lenses, corrector plates, and/or mirrors (often employed in other electron lenses designed for use with opaque photocathodes) are eliminated. The oblique electron lens is well suited to ultraviolet and vacuum ultraviolet image converters, and to image converters employiug opaque negative electron affinity photocathodes. It is also possible to use this oblique electron lens for electronography. Measurements on an experimental tube show that a limiting resolution of 50 line pairs/mm is possible, but the intrinsic lens quality is believed to approach that of a conventional electromagnetic lens having uniform and colinear electric and magnetic fields."

"A method for solving numerically the two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor steady-state transport equations is described. The principles of this method have been published earlier [1]. This paper discusses in detail the method and a number of considerable improvements. Poisson's equation and the two continuity equations are discretized on two networks of different rectangular meshes. The 2D continuity equations are approximated by a set of difference equations assuming that the hole and electron current density components along the meshlines are constant between two neighboring meshpoints in a way similar to that used by Gummel and Scharfetter [2] for the one-dimensional (1D) continuity equations. The resulting difference approximations have generally a much larger validity range than the conventional difference formulations where it is assumed that the change in electrostatic potential between two neighboring points is small compared withk T/q. Therefore, a much smaller number of meshpoints is necessary than for the conventional difference approximations. This reduces considerably the computation time and the required memory space. It will be shown that the matrix of the coefficients of this set of difference equations is always positive definite. This is an important property and guarantees convergence and stability of the numerical solution of the continuity equations. The way in which the difference approximations for the continuity equations are derived gives directly consistent expressions for the current densities that can be used for calculating the currents. In order to demonstrate the kind of solutions obtainable, steady-state results for a bipolar n-p-n silicon transistor are presented and discussed."
"A Josephson element is a nonlinear lossless element that is characterized by an internal frequency, ω0;, the autonomous frequency, proportional to the dc voltage across the element. Detection, mixing, generation, harmonic generation and mixing, and parametric amplification are possible using such an element. We present here general relations for the power flow at the frequencies of interest in such an element. These general power flow relations depend upon whether the autonomous frequency is phase-locked, either harmonically or subharmonically, to a frequency in the system or is unlocked. The results here generalize those given previously by Russer for the harmonically locked case."
"Analytical equations describing the high-frequency (1 MHz) capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics have been derived for diffused p-n junction diodes, including the effect of deep-level states within the bandgap. It was found that the C-3versusVcurve becomes nonlinear when the density of the deep-level states is large. From the derivedC-Vequation the density of the deep-level states may be calculated from the slope of theC^{3}VversusC(V- V_{2})/V^{2}curve, where V2is related to the energy level of the deep states. The value of V2may be determined from the recombination current versus temperature measurements at small bias. The theory has been applied to characterize the dominant deep-level recombination centers in Zn-diffused GaAs light-emitting diodes. The measured deep levels are within 0.2 eV of the midgap energy and the density of these centers is of the order of 1016cm-3."
"The influence of carrier generation within the space-charge regions of silicon p-n junctions upon their breakdown characteristics is analyzed. Universal plots for the calculation of the total multiplication in one-sided silicon junctions versus voltage and substrate concentration are given, which take into account both injection and generation of initiating carriers. It is shown that the multiplication factorMof practical (i.e., generation-dominated) silicon junctions differs from the pure hole-pure electron multiplication factors Mpand Mnand ranges between them, i.e.,M_{p} < M < M_{n}. Its calculated voltage dependence is well approximated by Miller's relationship with an exponentnbetween 4 and 7 for impurity concentrations in the substrate between 1014and 1017cm-3."
"In order to investigate the resistivity fluctuations associated with striations in silicon crystals, the silicon surface was supplied with an arrangement of closely spaced (10 µm) nonblocking aluminum-silicon contacts. The resistivity was measured using a Wheatstone bridge technique. In addition, we used the aluminum-silicon contacts for spreading resistance measurements. Measurements with aluminum-silicon contacts can be repeated, e.g., to demonstrate reproducibility. This is in contrast to the methods using a sequence of direct contacts between the metal probe and the silicon surface."
"First-order transistor theory leads to conclusions that do not compare well with experimental results obtained for today's transistors fabricated with sophisticated technology. In an effort to overcome this situation, Gummel [1] for the first time used a digital computer to give a unified exact treatment of one-dimensional device performance. This paper treats the two-dimensional case that must be considered in order to account for lateral current effects. A set of 3 nonlinear partial differential equations describing the flow of carriers within the transistor under steady-state conditions is formulated and solved iteratively. The potential distribution and the hole and electron distribution within the transistor are calculated, and two-dimensional plots of these quantities are given."
"The turn-on action by the p-base and n-emitter gates in a thyristor was studied by a new microwave technique. The initial conducting area, the lateral distribution of gate current flowing through the junction, and the time variation of excess carrier density injected into the n-base by the gate current were determined by measuring the reflection of microwave energy, vertically incident upon a small area (0.2 × 0.2 mm2) of the n-emitter layer. The new microwave technique has proved to be useful in designing new gate structures and in studying the operation of new devices."
"A detailed study of the small-signal ac response of ntentionally sodium-contaminated Si-SiO2-Cr structures has been made with mobile ion concentrations of 1010-1012ions/cm2, in the frequency range of 0.05-100 Hz, between temperatures of 300 and 450°C. The time dependence of the observed relaxation phenomena, attributed to the existence of deep traps near the SiO2-Cr interface, is slow enough to consider the measured relaxation spectra as quasi static. The dc bias dependence of the relaxation mechanism, manifested by a loss maximum around 0.6 V and by a monotonic decrease of the absorption frequency with increasing bias, is ascribed to shallow traps located at the SiO2-Cr interface. The trapping as well as the long range migration of Na+ions in SiO2has been carefully studied by I-V and C-V measurements carried out on both contaminated and on ultraclean samples. The long-range motion of the ions leads to the thickness dependence of the relaxation time. However, since the ac response is determined in the two halves of the measuring cycle alternately by the migration of ions in the bulk of the SiO2and by their emission from the shallow traps, the relaxation time is also dependent on the effect of the traps. Consequently, the observed bias-dependent activation energies, ranging from 0.91 to 1.21 eV, may also be interpreted as intermediate values, arising from the conduction of Na+ions in SiO2films with an activation energy of less than 0.91 eV, and from the release of ions from the traps having activation energies equal to or greater than 1.21 eV."
"Second breakdown has been studied in silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) thin-film diodes using the stroboscopic technique of Sunshine. Nucleation of current filaments, filament growth, and damage through the formation of melt channels are observed and related to the voltage waveforms, geometry, and base layer resistivity. The delay time and the minimum energy for the onset of second breakdown are related to heating of the high-resistivity side of the junction. Theoretical models are presented to describe nucleation of current channels in the junction and the melt transition. A junction channel forms when the sum of minority carrier and thermally generated current densities becomes equal to the local applied current density. The voltage across the junction then goes close to zero locally, but the internal field is not \"washed out.\" The channel is ballasted by the spreading resistance of the high-resistance region. The melt transition is described in terms of a single heat-transfer coefficient characteristic of the device type. As the melt filament grows, the voltage across the filament (and the device) falls. The threshold current for filamentation varies as (ρ-3/4), where ρ is the resistivity of the high-resistance region. Data on transistors are presented in support of the theoretical models."
"Megohm silicon monolithic resistors have been fabricated with sheet resistances up to 120 kΩ/□ using an implanted p-layer resistor which is buried under an implanted n-guard layer. The n-guard layer protects against slice-to-slice variations of the fixed surface charge, and was made using phosphorus doses and energy of 1.5-5 × 1012/cm2and 30 keV. Resistors have been fabricated up to 20 MΩ; sheet resistances were in the range of 7-120 kΩ/□ using boron doses and energies of 1-3 × 10:12/cm2and 30-300 keV. The sheet resistance, voltage dependence of resistance, temperature coefficients, junction leakage, and parasitic capacitance have been measured for different implantation parameters. This process has been used to fabricate two matched 8-MΩ resistors for use in a high input impedance differential preamplifier integrated circuit. A match of 2 percent and a magnitude tolerance of ±10 percent has been achieved. The temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) is about 4000 ppm/°C and tracks within 400 ppm/ °C. These resistors are linear up to ∼1 V, about 50 times higher bias voltage than required in the application. The structure and fabrication are compatible with present monolithic silicon integrated circuit processing."
"An electron tube with a Fabry-Perot resonator for the generation of millimeter and submillimeter waves, the Ledatron, has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally. Two different mode interactions, Fabry-Perot mode and surface wave mode, were predicted and found to exist. These two modes can be separated by proper selection of the mirror spacing of the Fabry-Perot resonator in the tube. These two mode oscillations have different characteristics. In the case of the Fabry-Perot mode, the oscillating frequency is tuned mainly by variation of the mirror spacing, that is, mechanical tuning is predominant. On the other hand, in the case of the surface wave mode, electronic tuning predominates. For gratings of the same physical size, the surface wave mode oscillator needs a larger electron accelerating voltage than the Fabry-Perot mode oscillator in order to obtain the same wavelength. The experimental results are in good agreement with our theory of operation."
"Analytical relationships are derived for the ratio of the intrinsic AM to FM noise, and for the intrinsic AM noise of IMPATT diode oscillators. The theory is confirmed experimentally for a silicon n+-p diode and an n-gallium-arsenide Schottky barrier diode operating at low and intermediate signal levels."
"The noise and efficiency of p+-n1-n2-n+and n+-p1- p2-p+high-low silicon IMPATT diodes have been studied as a function of doping ratio n1/n2or p1/p2. In contrast to GaAs IMPATT diodes whose efficiency can be improved with some degradation of noise performance, both the efficiency and noise of Si IMPATT diodes can be improved. As an example, for a 6-GHz silicon n+-p1-p2-p+IMPATT structure with a doping ratio of 10, the efficiency is 21 percent and the incremental noise as compared to a uniformly doped structure is about -6 dB. These results indicate that silicon high-low structures can compete favorably with GaAs structures in both efficiency and noise performances."

"This paper reports the highestxpower (frequency)2IMPATTS produced to date. A CW output power of 380 mW has been achieved at 92 GHz with an efficiency of 12.5 percent. An all-implanted double-drift n+-n-p-p+silicon structure was fabricated, using a lightly doped epitaxial layer as the starting material. The newly made structure uses a more shallow n+contact than previous diodes, and therefore has more equal drift spaces. Small-signal admittance calculations show lower susceptance per unit area in the newly made structure. The shallow contact has allowed the study of unequal dopings in the n- and p-drift spaces. Unequal dopings up to 50 percent can be tolerated with less than 20 percent variation in measured efficiency and output power. Both admittance and breakdown voltage calculations based upon experimentally determined doping profiles and independently measured ionization coefficients were found to be in good agreement with experiment. The doping profiles on both sides of the depletion region were determined byC(V)analysis. The testing of both the old and new structures has been carried out in a microwave circuit having improved mechanical tuning accuracy due to the introduction of a newly designed tuning plunger."
"The emitter efficiency of a bipolar transistor is calculated taking heavy doping effects such as impurity band formation and band tailing into account. It is shown that in most cases these effects, rather than the minority carrier lifetime in the emitter are limiting the transistor current gain. This allows us to define an effective emitter impurity profile for use in current transport calculations. The influence of the emitter and base impurity profiles upon the gain is studied, and experimental results are presented showing that the knowledge of the impurity profiles is sufficient to predict the one-dimensional current gain."
"This paper represents analytical results concerning the high-frequency limitations of FET's of junction-gate or Schottky-gate constructions. The intrinsicyparameters are calculated in closed form using the analog RC transmission line method. The bias dependence of various characteristic factors in the y parameters expressions are presented graphically. Equivalent networks including both the intrinsic and extrinsic resistance-capacitance elements are presented and used to calculate the power-gain and frequency limitations of FET's."
"A new device for photodetection is introduced in this study that is capable of responsivities comparable to devices operating in the charge-storage mode. Since the physical process involved corresponds to a photodiode in series with a high value of resistance, the device operates in real time and hence avoids the problems of switching encountered in the charge-storage mode at low light levels. The device utilizes this physical process in a new technique that significantly reduces the required surface area. Although the junction field-effect transistor (FET) serves as the prototype for the device, considerations for improving the magnitude of the output response and its linearity along with the responsivity-bandwidth product lead to a device having a very low transconductance_{m}and a large cutoff voltage VGC. Field-effect photodetectors fabricated in accordance with the principles developed for optimum photodetection are evaluated. Epitaxial silicon of conventional doping was used in the fabrication. The devices are found to exhibit the photodetecting characteristics expected from theoretical considerations. A simple two-lump approximation of the distributed gate-channel interface is found to adequately describe the frequency response of the devices. In contrast to the area-independent responsivity of the charge-storage mode, it is shown that the responsivity of the field-effect photodetector is proportional to the square of the device surface area. Depending upon the illumination level and the deviation from linearity that is tolerable, this area dependence presents one of the fundamental drawbacks of the field-effect photodetector for applition in dense arrays."
"Influences of the law of electrical conductivity σ on thermal switching and breakdown events were investigated. The conductivities selected were\\sigma_{1}\\propto \\exp(aT), or\\sigma_{1}\\propto \\exp(-B/T), and also voltageVdependent\\propto \\exp (bV), whenTis temperature and a, B, and b are constants. Simple models, thin film, and cylindrical specimens were considered. The influence of σ was examined by comparing steady-state V-I characteristics, the values of maximum voltages Vm, times for temperature runaway when voltages larger than Vmwere applied, and instabilities in the negative differential resistance ranges. Some significant differences were found as σ1rises much faster with temperature than σ2. Thus current filaments were very narrow when\\sigma_{1}\\propto \\exp(aT), but orders of magnitude wider when\\sigma_{1}\\propto \\exp(-B/T). For a given current, much larger temperature rises occur in the σ2than in the σ1case of conductivity. Transition to a branch line V-I characteristic and filament formation can occur in the σ2case at considerably higher temperatures than in the σ1case."
"The results of computer simulations are presented to describe the stabilization and amplification performance of supercritically doped transferred-electron devices that contain a cathode-conductivity notch. Broad agreement is found between the theoretical and experimental behavior. Nonlinear conversion of amplitude modulation (AM) to phase modulation (PM) is less than 5°/dB."
"A simplified model of the space charge in a magnetron is proposed, and the performance of the magnetron is calculated; the method differs from that of Welch in the space charge density assigned to the \"spokes,\" and from that of Hull in using energy conservation instead of the principle of induction to identify the operating point. The method is tested by applying it to four known magnetrons, covering a wide range of frequencies, operating voltages and power levels. In all four cases the method predicts the output power correctly within ± 0.5 dB, and the voltage within ± 2 percent, at the nominal operating current and field. It also predicts the frequency pushing, and provides information on the relative phase of the spokes, and other parameters. The spoke phase is found to be always within the range -20° to -60°."
"This paper presents a simplest case analysis of the peak quasi-static output capability of a linear lumped-target beam-semiconductor amplifier. The basic assumptions in the response analysis of Part I [1] are used, together with the premise that the semiconductor velocity-field characteristic exhibits strong saturation at fields well below avalanche breakdown. The analysis applies to the ultimate pulsed output at low duty cycle since thermal effects are not considered. The fundamental current and voltage limitations on target output are discussed separately in limiting cases, and it is shown that the linear output capability is determined jointly by the drift-region width, bias field profile, and avalanche multiplication constraint. The dynamic electric field behavior is calculated for the general case where voltage and current effects appear simultaneously, and it is shown how the output capability can be maximized for a given target area and load impedance by proper choice of drift-region width and doping level. The ultimate pulsed dc output current, voltage, and power levels are evaluated for semiconductor targets in terms of the target area, load impedance, carrier drift velocity, semiconductor band gap, and avalanche multiplication constraint. Detailed numerical predictions are given for silicon targets. The usefulness of the quasi, static analysis is discussed, and it is shown that the results obtained apply with minor modification to the case of step-function excitation. In conjunction with the results of Part I, the combined gain, rise time, and pulsed output power performance boundaries are established for the basic lumped-target beam-semiconductor amplifier. The feasibility of a subnanosecond-rise-time linear amplifier with 50-dB gain and a multikilowatt pulsed output level is shown. Various semiconductor materials are evaluated for application in a beam-semiconductor amplifier by examination of an overall figure of merit comprising gain, rise time, and peak output capability, and it is demonstrated that Si, Ge, and GaAs are nearly equal in overall merit. In conclusion, several novel devices are described that illustrate the adaptability of the electron beam-semiconductor concept to multiple-signal amplifiers, fast waveform sampling, and traveling-wave amplification."
 "The enhanced etch rate of ion damaged SiO2has been used to controllably taper steps in thermally grown SiO2. A 50-keV Ar+implantation with a dose of 3 × 1013/cm2produces a uniform taper of 35-45° with no vertical step at the top edge of the window. These results are observed by viewing the sample on edge with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The taper angle of the oxide varies from near vertical (90°) at a dose of 4 × 1012/cm2to very small angles at large dosages."

"The effect of emitter surface doping and emitter diffusion depth on the bandgap narrowing, temperature coefficient of collector current, temperature coefficient of current gain, and burst noise characteristics have been studied. The experimental investigation was done by fabricating two groups of n-p-n transistors. The first group of transistors was fabricated with three different emitter surface concentrations (C_{0} = 5 \\times 10^{21}, 2 × 1020, and 6 × 1019atoms/cm3) and fixed emitter depth (X_{JE}= 1.5µm), and the second group of transistors was fabricated with three different emitter depths (XJE= 0.8, 1.5, and 2.2 µm) and fixed emitter surface concentrations (C_{0} = 2 \\times 10^{20}atoms/cm3). The heavy doping (5 × 1021atoms/cm3) was found to have introduced a narrowing of the bandgap energy and a corresponding degradation in gain. An annealing experiment was conducted by heating the devices to 800°C for 16 h in nitrogen, and this experiment had the effect of recovering the bandgap narrowing and improving the gain. The temperature coefficient of collector current\\alpha_{T}=(1/I_{c}) \\cdot (\\DeltaI_{c}/\\DeltaT)was determined for fixed VBEand the temperature coefficient of current gain\\beta_{T}=(1/\\beta)(\\Delta\\beta/\\DeltaT)was calculated for fixed Ic. For the first group of transistors, αTwas found to have changed from 0.04 to 0.065 (1/°C) when C0was changed from 6 × 1019to 5 × 1021atoms/cm3. The corresponding change in βTwas from 4 × 10-4to 1 × 10-3(1/°C), indicating that the current gain for this group of transistors was much more sensitive to doping than to the collector current. For the second group of transistors, however, αTand βTwere found to have changed by the same orders of magnitude as XJEwas changed from 0.85 to 2.2 µm: αTchanged from 0.032 to 0.062 (1/°C) and βTchanged from 3 × 10-3to 6 × 10-3(1/°C). Emitter doping also showed a relationship to burst noise characteristics. Ninety-five percent of devices with low C0(6 × 1019atoms/cm3) were found to be free of burst noise."
"The performance of Indium Phosphide microwave oscillators is examined over the temperature range 110-470 K. The threshold field of the devices is shown to vary from 7 kV.cm-1at 110 K up to 10 kV. cm-1at 470 K, with a value of 8 kV.cm-1at room temperature. The results indicate little falloff in the operating efficiency of the oscillators between room temperature and 470 K. The operating frequency bands are shown to fall with increasing temperature with the frequency for maximum power changing by about 18 percent over the range 290-470 K."
"Experiments have been conducted with slabs (1.5 × 2.5 × 0.3 mm3) of n-InSb to determine the propagation of surface waves in the presence of drifting carriers. Interdigital transducers of 10 fingers each with finger width of 7.5 µ (periodicity 30 µ) are used to excite slow surface waves with phase velocity on the order of the electron drift velocity of 2 × 107cm/s. Integrated coplanar strip lines are used to carry to and from the transducers to X-band waveguides at each end. A nonsaturable unidirectional electronic gain of 11 dB/mm has been observed in the presence of counterstreaming electron-hole plasma created under pulsed high fields and a transverse magnetic field of 10 kG. The experimental results are explained on the basis of a surface plasma wave propagation model including the surface properties of the material through the surface recombination velocity. Rougher surfaces are shown to result in enhanced interaction but suffer from the susceptibility to oscillations. Reasonably well prepared but not exceptionally smooth surfaces are found to be better from the point of view of stable amplification."
"A report is made of a thin-film varactor-tuned Gunn effect oscillator in X band employing unencapsulated diodes. The Gunn device, which is an inverted mesa type, is mounted off the substrate on a copper header and this arrangement can dissipate 7 W without the Gunn device suffering thermal damage. The varactor is a beam-lead silicon p+nn+IMPATT diode connected in series with the Gunn device. A circulator is integrated with the oscillator to provide load isolation, and tuning ranges in excess of 2 GHz are reported. Good agreement exists between calculated and measured values of oscillator tuning range."
"A new method of providing artificially well-defined threshold characteristics in the domain switching of ferroelectric-ferroelastic Gd2(MoO4)3single crystals is presented and experimentally confirmed. The essence of the idea lies in the utilization of a coupling effect between the strain and the polarization which is a characteristic of ferroelectric-ferroelastic crystals. The potential barrier required for electrical switching with a definite threshold is produced by the strain due to locally deposited surface films, which results in strain-induced multidomain regions beneath the films and stabilizes the domain wall at the end of strain-free switching regions. The measured characteristics of the threshold switching elements were as follows; threshold voltageV_{t}=190V and switching timet_{s} = 0.6ms at applied full voltageV_{f} = 250V. These threshold switching elements have potential applications to a ferroelectric light valve array and a ferroelectric memory device."
"Transformation formulas for the four noise parameters are given as a function of the four scattering parameters. For example, the influence of the lead inductances of a microwave bipolar transistor is examined, showing new significant results. The described procedure is applicable to other semiconductor devices. Most of the general formulas in Section II are believed to be new."
"This paper is concerned with the representation of the collector-base junction of planar bipolar transistors by a model capable of accurate characterization of junction capacitance and avalanche breakdown behavior. The model chosen consists of an exponential impurity density profile with cylindrical peripheral region approximation, and is regarded as the simplest representation suitable for the purpose. Objectives are the practical determination of the defining parameters (collector background, impurity density, exponential characteristic length, and collector junction depth) for such a model, and the demonstration of its accuracy for the physical characterization of the device structure. Model parameter determination is carried out in terms of junction capacitance and BVCBOmeasurements, by processes of computer fitting between model and measured data; the procedures used are nondestructive. It is shown, in particular, that the values obtained for the collector resistivity and junction depth are in very good agreement with those derived by 4-point probe measurement and by bevel and stain sectioning, respectively."
"An accurate three-dimensional analysis of the performance of output gaps in klystron amplifiers was carried out. The parameters investigated were: beam radius, perveance, output gap angle, output gap peak voltage, RF phase, magnetic field, and beam interception. A new, accurate method for computing space-charge forces between axially and radially deformable rings was developed. Rigorous expressions for electric and magnetic fields in the tunnel and the gap were used. The highest computed efficiency for an optimally bunched beam was 80.3 percent with 6 percent \"ideal\" interception. An important conclusion is that efficiency decreases with increasing normalized tunned radius\\beta_{e}aforb/aconstant in the examined range0.4 <\\beta_{e}a<1.0and probably beyond. Excellent correlation in efficiency and interception between a model klystron developed by E. Lien of Varian and the authors' program was established."
"A computer simulation survey has been carried out on X-band CW and pulsed Gunn oscillators with a variety of contact conditions. It is shown that devices with a large cathode doping notch will have a nearly constant bias voltage-frequency product for optimum RF power generation. Such a relationship is not clear for devices with a smaller notch that is large enough to cause optimum injection of dipolar space charge. For both types of device there is an optimum ratio of transit frequency and cavity controlled frequency for optimum RF power generation. Several other detailed features of operation that cannot be explained by instantaneous-domain-formation models are dealt with, including the frequency dependence of the device conductance and capacity under conditions of optimum efficiency, and the bias current-voltage characteristics."
"From discussions on the behavior of the high-field domain, five different modes are shown to appear successively when changing the carrier concentration in material with a positive field derivative of the carrier-diffusion coefficient. Two of them are cyclically traveling modes whose traveling directions are opposite to each other. The others are trapped-domain modes, and they are classified by the positions in which they are trapped."
"A very compact device has been made for excitation of lasing in CdS at room temperature. A low-pressure glow discharge is produced by high-voltage pulses to pump the CdS crystal. The simple design required to confine the discharge and produce the necessary high density of electrons is described."
"By providing ohmic contacts and a rectifying contact to a Cr-doped semi-insulating GaAs material, triode-like device characteristics were experimentally verified. The current drawn through the device is interpreted as space-charge-limited current (SCLC). Operation of the device is shown to be qualitatively in agreement with the vacuum triode analog."
"An alternative scheme to transistor thermal stabilization by emitter resistor ballasting is proposed. The technique involves a resistor with a negative temperature coefficient of resistance connected across the emitter-base junction which bypasses excess base current that tends to be drawn due to local transistor heating."

  "Current work on display devices in Japan is surveyed. Work on plasma display panels includes several methods for producing gray scale on ac-driven bistable panels, a technique for moving the display on an ac-driven panel, and new types of plasma display panels. Development on several types of alphanumeric displays, including both new and older types, is summarized. Work on light-emitting diodes includes new fabrication techniques and new types of devices. The liquid-crystal work described includes addressing techniques, color modulators, and light-addressed light valves. A new cathodochromic display tube, a high-frequency oscilloscope tube, and an electroluminescent display panel are mentioned."
"A review of the basic research and industrial development of display devices in Western Europe during the years 1968 to early 1973 will be given. The display types considered are: 1) active displays such as cathode ray tubes, light-emitting diodes, electroluminescence cells, and gas discharge devices, and 2) passive displays such as laser displays, light valves, and ferroelectric and liquid-crystal devices."
"Recent technical approaches to optically addressable, cyclic or erasable, light valves for high resolution projection or direct-view display are reviewed. The general concept of light-valving cathode-ray tubes is first presented for historic and technological perspective. Secondly, photoconductor-controlled devices that incorporate a variety of electrically stimulated optically responsive active elements for light modulation, including ferroelectric ceramics, liquid crystals, electrooptic crystals, and deformable media, are compared for their reported functional characteristics. From the standpoint of performance only, there exist several potentially significant technologies that offer the capabilities of high optical sensitivity and rapid response, high amplification ratios, optical storage, and resolution which are not presently available in light valves addressed by means other than optical."
"The advantages of dynamic scattering liquid-crystal displays--extremely low power consumption, flexibility of size and format, color choice, and washout immunity--are not obtained without cost. Long life requires ac drive and hermetic packaging. The optical characteristics of dynamic scattering make it difficult to design a display that utilizes the liquid-crystal panel effectively under a variety of lighting conditions. Multiplexed drive is cumbersome at best, so cost of drive electronics for more than about four digits is higher than with competing display technologies. The development of twisted nematic displays will reduce drive costs and improve appearance although the changes will not be revolutionary. The large multiplexing capability or color variability of the alterable birefringence effect is offset by prohibitive manufacturing tolerances and narrow field of view. Led by low-power digital wristwatches, liquid crystals should achieve a substantial market in applications whose requirements match unique display properties. Effective penetration of the consumer mass market will await improved field-effect devices and reductions in semiconductor packaging costs."
"The objectives of this study were to determine the feasibility of utilizing nematic liquid crystals (LC) as media for aircraft displays from the point of view of their temperature range, response time, gray scale, and color control. According to this objective, the dynamic scattering and tunable birefringence mode of operation were investigated in some detail. Experiments, in agreement with derived mathematical models, led to the following conclusions : 1) The nematic temperature range can be made to fit any reasonable specification by forming multiple eutectic mixtures, provided the ingredients are compatible. 2) \"Write\" or \"contact\" times less than 2 µs have been (and less than 0.1 probably can be) realized with the help of \"blocking\" diodes. However, true rise times become generally longer than 1 s at temperatures below -20° C and electric fields at or below 3 V/µm. 3) The optical properties of electricallyinduced (dynamic) scattering can, in a first order approximation, be described by specifying the liquid crystal birefringence ration_{0}/n_{e}their average refractive index\\bar{n}, and the applied voltage. 4) Of several possible color display approaches, electrically tunable birefringence was selected as the most promising one. The widest viewing angle, |α| ≤30°, is achieved with reflective displays and best color definition (resolution Δλ/λ≃0.2) with retardations of Γ≃3/2 in \"single stage\" displays, as long as the overall cell thickness fluctuation\\Delta d < 0.1 \\lambda/(n_{e}-n_{0}). In addition, nematic liquid scattering and color display features are compared to those of PLZT, an electrooptic ceramic."
"Experiments with fluid logic circuits operated in an air-dyed water mode have demonstrated the basic validity of a large area, flat panel, matrix-addressed liquidic display. Such a display is conceptually attractive, since the switching, storage, and display functions are performed by the same medium. The measurements made have demonstrated that a reflective or emissive liquidic display, matrix addressed \"a line at a time,\" has the following advantages: a flat panel geometry, a wide viewing angle, TV or better resolution, high contrast and brightness, a gray scale and color capability, speed (for TV resolution) from dc up to 3 frames/s, a range of sizes from small up to blackboard or larger, permanent memory, and high thermal, radiation, and shock resistance. The power requirements are less than (0.015/τ) W/cm2of display area, where τ is the frame time in seconds. Most importantly, the liquidic display can be constructed in a cheap integrated form. An elemental integrated liquidic display has been built with laminated layers of photoformed ceramic and has been successfully operated. Measurements made on the deflection of a fine stream of water (a polar liquid) by a nonuniform electric field have shown that this dielectrophoretic effect forms an elegant low-voltage transducer for the liquidic display. Such a transducer can be used on the periphery of a fluidically addressed matrix. Alternatively, because of its simplicity, it is feasible to have a threshold transducer at each element and electrically matrix address the transducers."
"In order to develop simple low-cost liquid-crystal matrix displays, 5 × 7 dots alphanumeric matrix display panels with 7 × 80 elements have been made and tested. A newly synthesized nematic liquid crystal, p-methoxy-p'-ethylazoxybenzene, was used in the panels as the major component of the liquid crystals. The crosstalk was found effectively suppressed by rubbing the surfaces of electrode glasses besides applying a blanking technique. Furthermore, storage-type liquid-crystal matrix display devices with 120 × 120 elements were also reported. Various mixtures of nematic and cholesteric liquid crystals were used depending upon the storage and erasing conditions required for the imaging."
"An integrated 14 000 picture element 36-in2flat screen display panel has been constructed by a combination of thin-film transistor and nematic liquid-crystal technology. The design, fabrication, and present performance of the panel is discussed. The design of the peripheral circuits, which permit the presentation of low resolution off-the-air TV pictures on the panel is described in another paper."
"Incandescent alphanumeric displays using a 16-bar format are obtainable today. They employ 1-ml incandescent tungsten helices strung between support posts. This paper describes a new incandescent display device, fabricated by microelectronic thin-film techniques. Such techniques allow high-resolution dot-matrix displays to be produced with all the cost advantages obtained from the employment of modern LSI thin-film processing. The device uses a ceramic substrate covered with a thick layer of glass. Holes are produced in the laminate and filled with metal to eventually form the element support posts. A thin layer of refractory metal is deposited on the glass. The metal and glass are then etched to produce a field of free-standing microfilaments. The resulting display panel can be driven by simple integrated circuits, and the efficiency of the device, operating at 1200°C, is better than quoted for most light-emitting diodes (LED's)."
"A new matrix-type display device, the thin-film incandescent display device, is the object of this paper. In particular, this paper summarizes the results of work in the areas of device performance analysis, electrical interface requirements, and overall system evaluation."
"An electrically addressed liquid-crystal Fourier-plane filter capable of real-time optical image processing is described. The filter consists of two parts, a wedge filter having 40 9° segments and a ring filter having 20 concentric rings in a 1-in diameter active area. Transmission of the filter in the off (transparent) state exceeds 50 percent. By using polarizing optics, contrast as high as 104:1 can be achieved at voltages compatible with FET switching technology. A phenomenological model for the dynamic scattering will be presented for this special case. The filter is designed to be operated from a computer and is addressed by a 7-b binary word that includes an ON or OFF command and selects any one of the 20 rings or 20 wedge pairs. The overall system uses addressable latches so that once an element is in a specified state, it will remain there until a change of state command is received. The drive for the liquid crystal filter is ±30 V peak at 60 Hz. These parameters give a rise time for the scattering of 20 ms and a decay time of 80-100 ms. A complete description of the operational parameters of the device will be given and the results of several filtering experiments discussed."
"A concept for a holographic display system that can accept data in coordinate form and synthesize a three-dimensional scene in real time has been reported. Recent progress on this system centers around the recording medium and compensation of the frequency shift introduced by the deflection system. The need for a holographic recording medium that can be exposed, developed, and viewed in about 1 s is being met by a thermoplastic-photoconductor (TP-PC) film. The reusable TP-PC film has photographic characteristics comparable to standard holographic films. Improved TP-PC films having greater spatial frequency bandwidths, higher sensitivities, less background noise, and increased sequential recording capacity have been developed. The use of acousto-optic beam deflectors in the object and reference beams causes these beams to have different frequencies. In order to record holographic fringes of sufficient visibility, some frequency compensation scheme is therefore required. Several methods for achieving this compensation are discussed."
"A fluorescent europium chelate is used as the active medium of an experimental display panel. When the chelate is dissolved in an electrolytic solvent and placed between transparent conductive electrodes, 2.8 V dc will cause the ultraviolet stimulated fluorescence to be extinguished at the cathode electrode. Recovery from the quenched state occurs spontaneously when the voltage is removed or when the polarity of the potential is reversed. A cross-conductor matrix display is discussed where discrete points are quenched by applying half-voltage to the rows and columns of the matrix."
"This paper describes the fabrication and demonstration of a real-time incoherent-to-coherent optical converter having applications in image processing systems. Briefly, it utilizes the photoconductivity effect in the single-crystalline electrooptic material, Bi12SiO20to spatially modulate its electrical polarization. An optically absorbed write-in image is stored as an image wise polarization pattern in the device. Readout is accomplished electrooptically by means of the subsequent phase retardation that a polarized beam of coherent light undergoes in passing through the Bi12SiO20. An operating mode for achieving continuous image conversion with high-speed recyclability is described. The following performance characteristics have been demonstrated : write-in intensity of 300 µW/cm2at 400 nm yielded a contrast ratio of 50:1 after 40-ms exposure. When the converter was operated at a frame rate of 10/s, a sampled read-out contrast ratio of greater than 1000:1 was achieved. Resolution in excess of 80 1p/mm has been recorded and read out. The crystal growing and device fabrication methods by which 1-square-in converters have been built and operated are described. Results achieved in using this device to Fourier transform images are also presented."
"An electrooptic light valve is described, using the Pockels effect in a KD2PO4crystal cooled close to its Curie temperature and addressed by photoconduction in an amorphous selenium layer. The preliminary performance levels obtained are: resolution 40 lp/mm, maximum contrast ratio 70/1, writing time 10 µs, sensitivity <100 erg/cm2for 10/1 contrast, and a maximum modulation emciency of ≃75 percent. The linearity of the Pockels effect allows image addition and subtraction, the latter being obtained by reversing the applied voltage between two exposures. Experiments of first-and second-order image derivation using incoherent light are described, the latter obtained by subtraction of a blurred image from the initial one. The grainless structure of the KD2PO4plate prevents all loss of coherence in coherent optical data processing. Furthermore, suppression of the zero order in the Fourier transform of an image has been obtained by subtracting from that image a uniform one whose amplitude is equal to the average amplitude of the initial image; this results in the suppression of the optical noise introduced by the scattering of the zero-order term in coherent filtering experiments. Character-recognition experiments are described employing a filter hologram previously made using the same device. The high-speed capability of the device would permit the construction of automatic reading systems at least ten times faster than those generally available."
"A mathematical analysis is carried out for electron motion in a cylindrical electrostatic deflection yoke which is twisted around its axis and immersed in a uniform axial magnetic field to form a twisted focus projection and scanning (FPS) deflection system. The yoke has an arbitrary twist angle, and is a generalization of yokes with π/2 rad of twist recently used in FPS vidicons. New modes of operation are found which eliminate shading caused by off-normal beam landing at the target, while providing improved deflection sensitivity, increased resolution, and reduced power consumption in the focusing solenoid as compared with the untrusted shading-free mode previously reported by Schlesinger, Wagner, and Saldi [1]-[3]. The theoretical predictions are supported by data from experimental devices."
"Improved gun design has considerably increased the brightness of the 110°-25 in beam-indexing color display (triplet pitch ≈ 1.2 mm). Without dynamic correction for deflection errors the color reproduction in normal picture material is now satisfactory up to peak currents of about 2.5 mA (against 1.5 mA for the old gun)."
"Principles of operation and special operational features of a digitally addressed flat-panel electron beam display are discussed. Special emphasis is given to explaining methods of simplifying and optimizing the display structure for a given application, and techniques for implementing color and inherent storage to the structure. In addition, a fairly detailed analysis of the display power requirements is given, along with calculations for a specific display. Also covered are the operating characteristics of several prototype displays, and comments pertaining to life, manufacturability, and environmental characteristics."
"A direct electron-beam recorder (EBR) for nucleation film has been built and tested. This recorder overcomes many of the disadvantages of CRT-on-film recorders by providing a high-resolution black-on-white image that is available for viewing 1 s after recording. Immediate viewing of the film record eliminates the need for a CRT display with storage for viewing images from line-scan reconnaissance sensors. Nucleation film is developed by the selective condensation of zinc vapor on nucleation sites produced by electron exposure. It is developed in vacuum, adjacent to the recording electron beam. The image has a contrast of 8:1 for an exposure of 2 × 1011electrons/cm2. This EBR display uses 70-mm film at speeds of 0.08 to 8.3 cm/s to record a video image from a line-scan reconnaissance sensor. This contrasts with a previously described nucleation film/EBR that recorded high-resolution television images at 60 fields/s on 35-mm-wide film transported at 43 cm/s. The present recorder/display has an image viewing area 6 cm wide by 22 cm high where the 70-mm-wide film moves from top to bottom. The video bandwidth is 5 MHz and the horizontal resolution is 2400 lines. A major accomplishment of the work reported here was the design of a zinc vapor source with uniform flux for development of the 70-mm-wide nucleation film in a 0.5-cm space adjacent to the recording electron beam."
"A monolithic 5 × 7 array of planar diffused p-n junctions in GaAs1-xPx(x≃0.38) has been built for a light-emitting diode (LED) alphanumeric readout. A character formed by this readout is 0.246 cm high and 0.170 cm wide. The monolithic chip has all p-n junctions, n-contacts, p-contacts, interconnections and terminal metallurgy on the epitaxial layer which represents a departure from the conventional methods of making LED arrays, namely wire bonding discrete chips with contacts on two sides in a hybrid configuration. Each LED in the array is connected to one of the terminals arranged around the periphery of the chip and individually addressed by direct current from a driver on a silicon control chip. For each character position in a display there is one monolithic LED chip and one monolithic silicon control chip solder joined to terminals on a glass plate and interconnected by Cr-Cu-Cr lines evaporated onto the glass substrate. The display is addressed by serial information provided from an ROM which is read into a 35-stage shift register on the control chip which controls the drivers. Thus with two standard parts, any N-character display can be fabricated with considerable reduction in handling since no discrete elements or wire bonds are used."
"The fabrication and performance of matrix-addressable green-emitting monolithic light-emitting diode (LED) alphanumeric displays are described. Matrix addressability is achieved by p-n junction electrical isolation of n-type stripes of GaP in vapor-phase epitaxial n-epi/p-epi/n-substrate structures by a masked Zn diffusion. Each n-type stripe serves as the common cathode for the LED's in a given column, and with the assistance of a distributed ohmic contact, forms the column address. Light-emitting p-n junctions are formed in the isolated n-type stripes by a second masked Zn diffusion. Rows of LED anodes are electrically connected by thin-film metallization through vias in a glass insulating layer. This truly planar fabrication process potentially offers a marked reduction in the cost of matrix-addressable LED arrays. The transparency of nitrogen-free GaP to light generated at p-n junctions localized in a nitrogen-doped epitaxial layer permits displays of this type to be flip-chip bonded and viewed through the substrate."
"This paper describes recent developments in the fabrication of three-color-phosphor plasma display panels that improve both electrical and optical performance. The electro-optical characteristics of panels incorporating a phosphor bar pattern are presented, including the properties of panels fabricated with a black, UV-absorbing material surrounding the phosphors. In addition, processes developed to produce 20 × 20 in plasma panels with 512 × 512 three-color resolution elements at a total line density of 60 per inch are described."
"A technique for extracting stored information from an array of plasma display/memory elements uses a direct electrical detection system that senses the charge flow in selectively excited elements. Electronic drive schemes based on this technique and suitable for realizing readout capability in a large-scale plasma display system are described. The design of specially configured sense amplifiers used in these systems, the nature of the noise signals encountered in these systems, and the results of reliability tests on a 128 × 128 line plasma display system with readout are discussed."
"We have achieved a field-interlaced real-time gray-scale display on a 77 × 222-element Self-Scan Plasma Panel®. The 2:1 field-interlacing at 60 fields/s was obtained by stepping the priming glow at the horizontal line rate (one line per 125 µs) first along the odd-numbered cathodes (1 to 221) during one field and then along the even-numbered ones during the other. The display is operated in a line-at-a-time mode synchronized with the cathode stepping. MOS memory and buffer-memory circuits are provided for every vertical display anode to sample and apply a measure of the incoming video signal to the control of the anode current. The display anodes are connected to ground through IGFETS with the sampled information at their gates. The effective γ of the system is unity. The panel demonstrated a highlight luminance of 25 fL with an orange light output and a gray scale of more than eight levels."
"Good quality real-time TV pictures were displayed on a matrix gas-discharge panel of 80 columns and 212 rows. The 2.4- in wide × 6.3-in high Burroughs Self-Scan panel displays part of a TV picture, has a peak luminance of 8 fL, and a maximum usable contrast ratio of 40:1. The matrix is addressed one line at a time, using standard TV interlace and a continuous gray scale. Picture quality is comparable to that of a monochrome 25-in CRT and the picture can be readily viewed in a normally lit room. Dominant emission is from the neon gas; panel color is orange-red. Panel luminance and luminous efficiency are low compared to a CRT. The circuitry is more complicated--it must store the video signal and provide a total of 300 V for each display element."
"A gas discharge panel is described which uses thin-film nichrome spirals on the inside of the viewing window to give a resistance in series with each cell. The panel has internal memory and the cells can be operated with direct currents resulting in high cell luminance (∼3000 cd/m-2, ∼900 fL). Characteristics are described that are important for matrix operation and a form of panel address is proposed that avoids the necessity of providing priming electrons in each cell."
"An off-axis state of the art electron gun with a KD2P target crystal forms an on-line two-dimensional coherent spatial light modulator."
"New low-energy ion-implantation techniques are utilized effectively to fabricate a thin-film electroluminescent (EL) cell. By combining the techniques of implantation of the activator element and the deposited process for substrate material, both the dose distribution of activator elements and the selection of elements can be controlled externally by adjusting ion beam current and accelerating voltage, and by changing ion source units. In this correspondence, the methods to fabricate an Mn-implanted ZnS EL cell and fundamental properties of the cell are reported. Usual Mn-implanted ZnS thin-film EL cells fabricated by thermal processing show little or no emission under dc excitation. But the cells reported here show strong emission under dc excitation. No change of brightness of the cell under dc excitation at constant voltages (25.5 unidirectional pulse of 1/5 duty factor) could be observed during 500 h."
"The feasibility of calibrating the power spectra of light-emitting diodes (LED's) by direct substitution against a tungsten standard lamp is demonstrated. Because LED's often emit in more than one band over a wide spectral range, spectral interval standards are proposed to characterize the quantum efficiency of the intended dominant recombination processes in GaP and GaAsP."

"The behavior of a group of triodes of an electron gun having all the same cutoff voltage is discussed with respect to its physical dimensions. Especially the relation between gun characteristics and a design number (A, B) is investigated whereAis the distance between cathode surface and modulator and B between modulator and anode. For a fixed-grid drive pulse the total emitted cathode current and the portion of it passing through a beam-limiting aperture increases with increasingB(decreasingA) whereas the resolution decreases. If the electrical parameters like anode voltage and cut off voltage are already determined it can be concluded that there is a certain design number (A, B) for optimized beam density on a phosphor screen."
"Many IGFET integrated circuits incorporate a region of enhanced doping under the field oxide to eliminate the possibility of spurious inversion layers causing leakage between devices. Using chemical predeposition technology, this typically requires a photolithographic step to define the region of enhanced doping. This paper describes a structure in which a nonselective implantation that forms an enhanced doping over the entire wafer is selectively compensated through windows patterned in the field oxide to form gate oxide regions. Threshold voltage control is excellent and identical to control devices fabricated without chan stops. The channel hole mobility is normal and no undesirable effects have been observed if care is exercised in controlling the implanted doses. MOS characteristics are normal and are not affected by residual ion damage. Typical parameters for p-channel devices are shown for various levels of compensation, resulting in gate threshold voltages ranging from -0.5 →-2.2 V for p-channel devices. The field threshold is -18.V for a 7000 Å thick field oxide and hole mobilities range from 190 to 290 cm2/V.s."
"A method for analysis of wave propagation on structures consisting of periodic metal strips is presented. The method is an extension of earlier theories based on Legendre polynomial expansions of the electric field. The extension allows analysis of strips on any material or layers of materials, provided the electromagnetic properties can be expressed in terms of a wavenumber-dependent permittivity. Layers of dielectrics, piezoelectrics, semiconductors, and metals are typical of the materials of practical interest in connection with surface wave acoustics. Strip configurations such as interdigital transducers, multistrip directional couplers and reflectors, and strip coupled amplifiers can be analyzed by the present approach. Prescriptions for calculating the amplitudes of the space harmonics of the electric field strength are given. Closed-form expressions for strip current and voltage are developed."
"Dispersion relations for acoustic surface waves in piezoelectrics with periodic metal strips applied to the surface are developed. Particular emphasis is given to the modification in effective piezoelectric coupling due to strip geometry, and the details of the dispersion relations around the stop bands. The general results are applied to discuss devices such as multistrip directional couplers and strip-coupled amplifiers."
"A new material has been developed as a resistive sea for the silicon diode-array camera tube target. The material is prepared by reactive sputtering of a hafnium tantalum cathode in a nitrogen atmosphere. By adjusting the relative amounts of hafnium and tantalum in the cathode or by changing the sputtering parameters, the resistivity of the hafnium tantalum nitride sea may be optimized. The nitride may be heated to 350°C during camera tube bakeout with no degradation in performance. By controlling the film deposition conditions, electrostatic focus camera tubes have been made with excellent aging, dark current, lag, and resolution characteristics."
"The most important characteristics of the MOS transistor operating in weak inversion are discussed. When the drain voltage is greater than a fewkT/qit is demonstrated that the drain current can be written as the product of the geometrical factorW/L, the minority carrier diffusion constant, and the inversion charge at the source. In the classical theory, the slope of the In IDversus VGcurve is only influenced by the capture of minority carriers by surface states. It is demonstrated that the Nssvalues obtained from these current measurements are in disagreement with the values found by independent surface states measuring techniques."
"The classical theory of the MOS transistor operating in weak inversion, attributes the slope of the In IDversus VGcurve to the capture of minority carriers by surface states. The discrepancy between the Nssvalues given by this theory and by independentt surface states measuring techniques is explained by the influence of surface potential fluctuations. These fluctuations are caused by the statistical distribution of the oxide charge."
"An Al-Si Schottky diode has been incorporated in a p-n-p-n switch using a lateral p-n-p transistor and a vertical n-p-n transistor as a clamp. The switching characteristics are improved (speeded up). The dc characteristics display a negative resistance in the on region, and the on voltage at moderate currents is approximately the same as an unclamped p-n-p-n switch."
"Analytical expressions for the noise figure of a traveling-wave amplifier (TWA) preceded by a nonuniform drift space are derived. Numerical results show that the noise figure for an accelerated beam has a minimum at a specific drift length. Also, when the noise figure is plotted as a function of heater power, it shows a minimum value."
"A three-mask process has been developed which permits one to fabricate MOSFET or integrated circuits with self-aligned gate, reduce capacitance, and flatter surface topology. Ion implantation and silicon nitride layers were employed in this process."
"The significance of using different ionization rates on the operating characteristics of Si IMPATT devices is examined. The dc breakdown and small-signal results of IMPATT devices at room temperature are presented. Numerical results for p+nn+as well as the complementary n+pp+Si diodes in the millimeter-wave frequency range and at different current densities ranging from 2500 to 10 000 A/cm2are given. It is shown that large differences in some important device parameters are obtained, depending on the ionization rates employed."
"The behavior of the surface mobility of electrons of low-mobility semiconductor films in electroacoustic amplifiers is qualitatively explained by the polycrystalline inhomogeneous film model and the presence of the trapping states. It is postulated that the presence of a positively biased metallic film on the opposite face of the substrate will yield enhanced and yet controllable mobilities."

"Ion implantation is being applied extensively to silicon device technology. Two principle features are utilized- 1) charge control in MOS structures for threshold shift, autoregistration, and complementary wells and 2) distribution control in microwave and bipolar structures. Another feature that has not been extensively exploited is to combine the advantages of the high resolution capabilities of electric beam pattern delineation with the low lateral spread inherent in the implantation process. This talk reviews some of the general features of the characteristics of implanted layers in terms of depth distribution, radiation damage and electron activity. Implantation processes in silicon are reasonably well understood. There remain areas which require further clarification. For compound semiconductors, particularly GaAs, implantation techniques offer attractive possibilities for the fabrication of high frequency devices. In these materials, the substrate temperature during implantation and the dielectric coating required to prevent dissociation during thermal anneal play major roles."
"Extremely sophisticated circuit analysis programs are in common use throughout the entire semiconductor industry. Today's electrical engineer has available to him circuit analysis tools heretofore unknown in the electronics industry. The steady-state and transient characteristics can be accurately calculated for highly complex transistor circuits. It is argued that despite the degree of mathematical sophistication contained in these computer programs, the equivalent circuits used to approximate the semiconductor components (transistors, resistors, etc.) are crude and inadequate. Thus, an a priori calculation of an integrated circuit is within reach of the entire semiconductor industry - although we lack satisfactory equivalent circuit approximations for the semiconductor components."
"Starting from the basic transfer principle the operation of the peristaltic charge coupled device is described. Theoretically and experimentally this device is shown to be the most promising of charge transfer devices in terms of charge handling capability, charge transfer inefficiency (ε ≈ 5. 10-5) and operating frequency (f> 100 MHz)."
"Buried-channel charge-coupled devices offer many advantages over surface channel devices at the expense of only one additional step in the fabrication process; i.e., the channel implant. Two important parameters for the implanted layer are discussed, namely, (i) the potential difference between the channel region and the dielectric interface and (ii) the depth of the channel region. Computer results showing the influence of some of the process variables on these parameters for the specific case of a two-phase, implanted barrier asymmetry, device are presented. Finally, performance results for a buried-channel device designed with an optimum choice of these parameters are compared to those of an otherwise identical surface channel device."

A density greater than6\\times10^{6}bits/inch2results using a minimum geometry length of five microns. The array structure will be described and array characteristics will be given and compared to standard overlapping gate arrays."
    "This paper discusses an improved technique, based on transient thermal response measurements, to non-destructively evaluate die attachment in semiconductor devices. The technique was confirmed with studies performed on diodes bonded to TO-5 headers and transistors bonded to both TO-5 and TO-66 headers with voids intentionally incorporated into the die attachment. The advantages of using the transient thermal response technique for screening semiconductor devices for poor die attachment are emphasized."
 "A new technique of doped oxide diffusion is developed and investigated. In the present method, the doped oxide is deposited in an evacuated system from organic compound sources. We applied this method to every diffusion process in the fabrication of bipolar IC. The reproducibility of the \"unsaturated diffusion\" is much improved and less defect generation as compared with the conventional methods is confirmed, Its extensive applicability has standardized the diffusion process in which various kinds of techniques have been used."
"An exact simulation technique for Depletion Load Devices made by Ion Implantation has been developed in the case of low drain voltages. Given the boron ion implant energy and dose, an initial doping profile is calculated from the annealing conditions and recently developed profile models. The electric field at the silicon-oxide interface and the concentration of carriers as a function of depth are calculated using a fast converging one-dimensional numerical solution to Poisson's equation applied to the case of a non-constant doping profile. After correcting for work function differences and slow surface states, the actual drain current versus gate voltage (I-VG) for the MOS transistor are obtained. Similar calculations using the depletion approximation and an equivalent constant doping profile have been done. However, the results to be presented here show a strong dependence of the I-VGon the detailed nature of the doping profile. Excellent fit is found with the experimental data."
"The benefits inherent in the tetrode structure and the potential of GaAs as the material are combined to realize a dual-gate FET with a low noise figure and a wide dynamic range at microwave frequencies. Following the newly constructed design theory of GaAs dual-gate FET, an improved device structure is derived and FET's are fabricated using a Schottky barrier for the gate. The improved device exhibited a noise figure as low as 3dB and a power gain of 12dB at 4GHz. The stability factor and maximum stable gain are much larger than the single gate unit. By varying the 2nd gate bias, the power gain was controllable over a wide range of 30dB at 4GHz without significantly affecting the input impedance."
"Processing dependencies of D-MOS threshold voltage are described in this paper. An efficient mini-computer program was written to calculate doping profiles based on processing parameters. D-MOS structures were fabricated to determine empirical program parameters. Using computer simulation the threshold dependencies on boron predeposition and channel length, the two most sensitive processing parameters, were studied."
"A new floating-gate junction FET has been developed for various applications as a light-sensor, an analog memory and a time-delay unit. This device is integrable in conventional bipolar ICs and is useful in time-related circuits which otherwise require large capacitors."
"A retention time theory is developed for layered insulator FET (LIFET) memory devices in which the dominant cause of amnesia is attributed to tunnelling of charge back to the silicon. The theory incorporates the effect of surface states and the time dependence of the electric fields in the insulators. An equation for the threshold voltage correct to first order in the electric field is derived and solved exactly. To facilitate comparison with other theories, the solution is given in expressions valid over several decades of time. The solution predicts in agreement with experimental results that after a delay time which is exponentially dependent on the initial threshold voltage, the oxide thickness and the surface state density, the threshold voltage decays logarithmically eventually tailing off exponentially. In the logarithmic regime the decay rate varies as the inverse square of the oxide thickness, the square root of the trap depth and inversely as the rate at which the density of surface states increases. The calculated decay rate is found consistently to be lower for alumina devices than for nitride devices. The effect on the decay rate of trap depth, density of surface states, thickness of each of the two insulators, the dielectric constant of the thicker insulator and the initial threshold voltage are carefully examined and the results presented in the form of graphs and tables to provide guidance for memory product design."
"A new device structure for MNOS non-volatile memory is proposed for the purpose of getting higher writing speed and lower writing voltage. Basic concept is quite analogous to the double-diffused MOS transistor, where the gate oxide is replaced by a combination of the ultrathin oxide of silicon and the silicon nitride. When operated by the hybridization mode of the direct tunneling and the avalanche injection, typical results are as follows: (a) writing time is reduced to less than 100 ns, and (b) writing voltage is about 25 volts which is 10 volts lower than the conventional MNOS structure with the same nitride and oxide thicknesses of 400 Å and 16.5 Å respectively."
"The Hg1-xCdxTe ternary compound is a material in which the forbidden bandgap can be varied. It lends itself ideally to the fabrication of photovoltaic infrared detectors in the 2 to 12µm spectral region. Special effort was directed toward the development of a component with superior performance and reliability. The crystal growing process is controlled to yield large diameter, homogeneous crystals. Mass production techniques commonly used in the semi-conductor industry are implemented for the processing of the photodiodes. More advanced techniques, such as ion implantation are being considered. Single-element detectors and multi-element arrays with high performance characteristics in D*, quantum efficiency and cut-off frequency have been fabricated."
"The performance of n-type Hg0.8Cd0.2Te (PC) detectors under high optical flux densities was investigated. Detector photoconductivity and response time were measured, in the presence of 10.6 µm laser radiation. Flux densities, Φ, were varied over four orders of magnitude up to a maximum level of\\Phi = 10^{21}photons/cm2-sec (i.e approximately 40 w/cm2). For high flux levels the photoconductivity varies as the cube root of the incident flux and the detector response time varies as\\Phi^{-2/3}. It is concluded that the observed saturation in photoconductivity is due to the decrease in carrier lifetime with carrier concentration. The dominant recombination mechanism at high flux levels was determined to be Auger recombination. Evidence is found that at low flux levels other recombination processes may also be important."
"Modified Schottky barriers of the type Au-CdS:Cu were prepared by diffusing Cu to a depth of 0.1 to 0.2 µm into single crystals of CdS, prior to evaporating rectifying Au contacts. Modulation of essentially thermionic forward current by light-induced lowering of an electrostatic barrier leads to steady-state electron-per-photon gains in excess of 106at light intensities lower than5 \\times 10^{11}photons cm-2sec-1where response times exceed 1 sec. Barrier-height determinations, in the dark and under illumination with 5000-Å light, by means of internal photoemission, thermal activation energy, and J-V measurements, show unequivocally that under saturating light conditions the potential barrier is reduced by 0.23 ± 0.03 V."
"Large single crystals (.5 \\times .5 \\times 4cm) of KTaO3have been grown by the Czochralski method. The growth parameters and electrical properties have been investigated. Crystals were grown either highly insulating (>10^{14}\\Omega) or semiconducting n-type depending upon growth conditions. Photovoltaic cells were made by contacting the KTaO3with either evaporated thin metal films or silver paint. The ultraviolet (UV) responsivity and detectivity of an a.c. photovoltaic cell using KTaO3has been measured. Under no-bias conditions the responsibity was7.0 \\times 10^{6}V/W and the detectivity, Dλ*, was\\sim 10^{12}cm Hz1/2/W at 3000Å measured a t 20 Hz. Other properties are also discussed."

"A theoretical and experimental study of planar diffused structures with field limiting rings is presented. The basis of the theory is a new type of depletion layer logic which allows making field calculations in back-biased structures with floating field rings in the presence of surface charge. Using the results of the field calculations, avalanche multiplication factors are calculated along the gradient of the potential. Circular planar rectifiers with one field limiting ring were fabricated to test the theoretical results. The dependence of the field ring potential versus the applied potential and the avalanche breakdown voltages for theory and experiment were within ten percent. A result of the study is that the field ring junction is not completely effective in assuming increases in applied voltage beyond the punch-through voltage to the field ring."
 "This paper describes a new gate thyristor which has advantages that the di/dt and dv/dt capabilities are large, the gate voltage for firing is high, and the unbalance of forward currents through a plurality of devices connected directly in Parallel is small."
"In power thyristors and transistors, it is important to inject or remove carriers uniformly and rapidly across the entire junction area. Among the reasons are: 1.) the switching losses are reduced, thus allowing a higher load current rating of the device, 2.) a thyristor becomes capable to turn-off the load current by gate control, thereby eliminating commutating components and their losses. Uniform carrier injection or withdrawal and other desirable side effects are accomplished by a gate (base) emitter interdigitation in the form of equidistant involutes of a circle."

Devices were fabricated on a variety of different substrates including"
  "The maximum delay-bandwidth product achievable in a serial charge transfer device is set by charge transfer inefficiency. This limitation can be addressed by improving the transfer efficiency of the transfer elements themselves, or by adopting a parallel architecture so that the number of transfers required for each signal packet is reduced. A new device structure is presented which uses a parallel architecture to solve this problem while maintaining most of the flexibility of the serial transfer approach. In this structure each charge packet is gated into a charge transfer cell where it remains until it is replaced. A non-destructive readout is achieved by sloshing the charge back and forth within the cell to obtain a capacitive pick-up on an overlying output electrode. With a simple experimental device, over 105readings of a single charge packet has been demonstrated. In this experiment the charge was transferred2 \\times 10^{5}times. The results obtained in this experiment are equivalent to those obtained with a serial charge transfer device with a transfer efficiency of 0.999999."
"A switched capacitor, p-channel, 1024-- bit random access memory has been made with electron lithography. The circuit was the same as that described by Boll and Lynch (IEDM, 1972) but with halved lateral dimensions. For a given cell the gate length of the switching transistor was 4µm, and the chip size was 1.2×1.8mm. In order to fabricate the device, a 1µm alignment accuracy was required. Even with the modest shrinking of feature size, the minimum access time of the memory was reduced to less than 50 ns."
 "The maximum drain voltage for which an M.O.S.T. still obeys its normal pentode-like characteristics is an important consideration, especially to the circuit designer. For short channel devices the restrictions on the maximum drain voltage are even more severe than for longer channel devices, and therefore an accurate method of predicting these voltage limitations is required. The drain voltage is limited by two mechanisms; namely (a) punch-through of the drain depletion region to the source and (b) breakdown due to impact ionization in the high field region at the drain edge. A two-dimensional analysis technique for determining the drain voltage at the onset of either punch-through or avalanche breakdown, from a solution of Poisson's Equation within the substrate depletion region, is adopted. The punch-through voltage is defined as the drain-to-source voltage at which the longitudinal field at any point along the edge of the source region inverts in sign to permit the drift of minority carriers from source to drain. Breakdown voltage, however, is determined by the drain voltage at which the maximum field in the device reaches the critical value for avalanche multiplication. Good agreement is achieved between theoretical and practical results for both mechanisms on a variety of devices. The effects of varying both the physical device parameters and gate voltage are also described."
   "In IGFET operation, electrical breakdown between source and drain has been attributed to drain-junction avalanche breakdown. IGFET source-drain breakdown occurs at voltages less than drain-junction avalanche breakdown; this voltage decreases with decreasing channel length. Source-drain breakdown can be induced by increasing gate biasing voltage. Moreover, a large breakdown current is often sustained after removing the gate voltage. In this situations the IGFET \"latches\" in a source-drain breakdown mode. IGFET source-drain breakdown can be attributed to the extrinsic (or parasitic) bipolar transistor in parallel with the intrinsic IGFET structure. Carrier multiplication within the drain space-charge layer produces a substrate potential distribution that turns on this parasitic region; thus, IGFET source-drain breakdown is equivalent to emitter-collector breakdown (BVCEX) for a bipolar transistor. Our mathematical model semi-quantitatively shows: the IGFET source-drain breakdown characteristics; the \"latching\"phenomenon; and the reduction of source drain breakdown voltage with decreasing channel length."
"Fabrication processes have been developed for the construction of an n-channel insulated-gate gallium arsenide field effect transistor (MISFET). GaAs-insulator interface properties were investigated from an analysis of MIS characteristics Energy distributions of interface state density were U shape having minimum values near the midgap energy. The minimum values were dependent upon conduction type of substrates amd deposition conditions of insulator films and ranged1 - 20 \\times 10^{11}cm-2eV-1for p-type substrates and1 - 4 \\times 10^{12}cm-2eV-1for n-type substrates. The n+-regions for source and drain were made by diffusion of tin from the tin-doped silica film or by implantation of silicon ions. The planar passivated diode showed leakage current of less than 1 µA at 5 V reverse bias. An n-channel MISFET was fabricated using above techniques. The maximum field effect mobility of 1480 cm2V-1sec-1was obtained."
"The design principles for a high-convergence, dual-mode gun, operable over a wide range of perveances without beam degradation, are given.

 "Techniques resulting in high efficiency over extended bandwidths have been investigated. The objective was to obtain both a high average power capability and high efficiency at differing output power levels. A dual mode electron gun has been designed and evaluated. Favorable beam characteristics have been demonstrated at different perveance levels corresponding to both modes of operation, Suitable dispersion shaping methods have resulted in high interaction impedances with small phase velocity variations over octave bandwidths. Large signal computer evaluations considering beam-circuit wave velocity resynchronization techniques have been conducted. The tube employs a multi-stage depressed collector to further improve efficiency. Output power levels of 5kW have been demonstrated at 10% duty in the high mode and continuous wave power levels of 2kW have been attained in the low mode. Minimum octave bandwidth pulse efficiencies of 38% and continuous wave efficiencies of 45% have been demonstrated. The performance of this device represents a significant advance in the state of the art of high efficiency dual mode. TWT's."
"The feasibility of multiple-coupled slow wave structures interacting with multiple electron beams in a single traveling-wave tube has been established. A device has been designed and constructed which delivers high output power levels over a broad instantaneous frequency range. A composite dual circuit structure consisting of countra-wound helices has been shown to support traveling-wave interaction with two electron beams. Suitably low dispersion characteristics have been combined with nominal interaction impedance to provide power across the 4 to 8 GHz octave bandwidth. Dual electron beams are provided by two distinct cathode structures, each of which has a separate and individually modulatable anode. Data has been recorded for both single and dual beam operation at various values of perveance. Novel backward wave oscillation suppression techniques, which are unique to the dual helix circuit geometry, have been included in the tube design. The dual electron beams are consistent with low operating voltages, which, in turn, make the tube compatible with common power supplies. For a given output power level, the overall size and weight will generally be smaller than that of tubes requiring higher operating voltages. The dual helix circuit has roughly twice the potential thermal capacity of a single helix structure. The design is tailored to dual mode operation with the high power mode supported by both electron beams and a low power mode supported by a single electron beam."
"Recent work at RCA has demonstrated that the Traveling-Wave tube can be extended in bandwidth to provide double octave performance with excellent RF parameters. This accomplishment adds significantly to the already unexcelled gain-bandwidth product of the TWT. Obviously, a single Traveling-Wave tube with double octave performance capability can be used in wide band receiver and transmitter chains to replace two (2) standard tubes normally covering the same frequency band. This approach enhances the efficiency of a system, conserves space and power supply requirements. The prerequisites for satisfactory double octave performance -- good gain flatness, control of second harmonic output, and adequate overdrive capability -- must be met to satisfy system needs depending on signal environment. RCA has recently demonstrated double octave performance on a Traveling-Wave tube chain consisting of 10 mW and 5 Watt tubes operating over the 2 to 8.6 GHz band. Both of these tubes use design techniques to obtain so called \"anomylous\" RF wave dispersion to simultaneously achieve gain flatness and low harmonic output. Harmonic capture is minimized by designing for rising helix synchronous potential as a function of frequency. This technique keeps the bunched beam, containing second harmonic power, in an unfavorable interaction phase which minimizes its effects on the fundamental frequency interaction process. Moreover, excellent gain flatness is obtained with approximately 5 dB gain change across the total bandwidth."
 "The motion of an image over a gas-discharge display panel occurs when cells at the leading edge begin to fire as cells are extinguished at the trailing edge. The visible light emitted by the discharge has a rise time which is instantaneous from the point of view of an observer. The combination of this light with light emitted by a photoluminescent phosphor excited by a component of the emission of the discharge can cause a moving image to exhibit a leading edge of the color of the gas discharge, a body of the color produced by the combination of gas-discharge light and phosphor fluorescence, and a tail of the color of the phosphor emission. The phenomenon is due to the relatively long rise time of the fluorescence of the phosphor. This effect can improve the ability of a viewer to distinguish moving from stationary images and from noise; it can indicate direction of motion and speed by means of the order of the three colors and the relative sizes of the three regions. The incorporation of phosphors into DIGIVUE(R)Display/ Memory panels will be described. Photoluminescent properties of various compatible phosphors will be given and some phenomena related to the human observer will be discussed. Preliminary results with panels containing combinations of phosphors of different time constants will be presented. These do not require any visible emission from the gas discharge."
    "Cathode ray tube technology continues to provide the performance and operating parameters essential to advanced system needs.

How this has been accomplished, pertinent facts and figures and interpretation of comparative results are presented as a guide to the display engineer faced with selecting the proper approach to match a particular set of circumstances."
"The ultimate limitations to the performance of existing and new photodiode structures, which are imposed by both theoretical considerations (noise factor, amplitude distribution of gains, gain-bandwidth product, etc.) and practical limitations (choice of materials, device uniformity, difficulty of designing high speed structures in which most of the light is absorbed in a region of the depletion layer such that the carriers being multiplied are of the more strongly ionizing type, etc.), are examined. It is shown that for a properly designed structure, a useful figure of merit for high-speed (high-gain) operation is given by η/k1/2, where η is the quantum efficiency and k is the effective ratio of the ionization coefficient of the weakly ionizing carrier to that of the strongly ionizing carrier. It is shown further that for various reasons the prospects for achieving low-noise avalanche photodiodes having gain-bandwidth products much above 200 GHz are not too bright."
"A sampling approach to low-level optical signal detection is reported and the advantages of sampler based instruments for the analysis of complex, high-harmonic content signals are re-examined for opto-electronic considerations.

The sampling head, adapted to an electron multiplier section, is tested for sequential sampling on HeNe, mode-locked laser pulses showing good resolution and signal to noise ratio. The influence of parameter variation on the sampling function is assessed on the basis of photoelectron ballistics; discussion includes optimum and limiting resolutions which extend into the picosecond regime."

This acoustooptic multiplexer/demultiplexer is shown to be one of the best candidates for an ultrahigh data rate PCM communication system using the mode-locked pulse train from a Nd3+:YAlG laser."
  "This paper describes a new integrated circuit process in which CMOS and bipolar integrated-circuit technologies have been monolithically mated without compromising the performance characteristics of either the bipolar or the CMOS devices. The approach taken has been the addition of the required steps for fabricating CMOS devices to the basic linear-integrated-circuit process. This approach results in the need for one additional photoresist step over the process used for linear integrated circuits with compensating MOS capacitors. The basic processing steps, including the ion-implantation technique used to form the p-wells for the NMOS devices, are presented and discussed. Typical characteristics of the bipolar and CMOS devices fabricated with this process are shown. An amplifier circuit using this process has been fabricated. PMOS input devices are used along with the bipolar devices that provide the functions of current mirrors and high-gain amplifiers. CMOS devices are used in an inverter output stage."

"The results of a detailed electrical and metallurgical study are presented for an Ohmic contact which is used in GaAs device technology. The electrical behavior of alloyed Ni/Au-Ge films on epitaxial n-type GaAs found from conventional current-voltage and capacitance-voltage techniques is correlated to the composition-depth profiles found using a new thin-film analysis technique combining Auger electron spectrsocopy with sputter etching. Below the eutectic temperature of the Au-Ge mixture, the Ni is shown to diffuse rapidly through the Au-Ge film. Above the Au-Ge eutectic temperature, the specific contact resistance is shown to drop by a factor of greater than 109as the Ge and Au diffuse into the GaAs. The presence of the Ni at the Au-Ge/GaAs interface is shown to markedly alter the resulting contact surface uniformity. The lack of a reproducible and reliable Ohmic contact to moderately doped n-type GaAs has been a persistent problem in metal-semiconductor technology. One widely used technique is to alloy evaporated metal layers, such as Ni/Au-Ge, to clean GaAs in order to obtain a low resistance contact (1-3). We report here a detail electrical and metallurgical study of the Ni/Au-Ge contact system on epitaxial GaAs; unique to our study is the new metallurgical technique of thin-film profiling using Auger electron spectroscopy and sputter etching. This work is an extension of the preliminary metallurgical results reported earlier on bulk material only (4)."

The lateral diffusion of zinc extends upto seventeen microns for a junction depth of one micron. The lateral diffusion of tin extends upto sixty microns for a junction depth of one-eighth of a micron. Interfacial stress between mask and substrate has been measured and shown to be the driving force for the large lateral movement of these diffusants. Techniques which will reduce the interfacial stresses and decrease the lateral movement of the diffusants are presented in this paper."

"This article describes the fabrication technology and preliminary results of a new generation of bulk acoustic delay lines. The approach being taken is to use magnesium aluminate spinel (MgAl2O4) as the delay medium and to fabricate shear wave transducers from bulk lithium niobate (LiNbO3). We have recently developed a technology for fabrication of sub-micron bulk platelet instead of thin film transducers. Lithium niobate transducers with thicknesses as thin as 0.2 µm have been achieved. This technology employs a novel bonding technique, the room temperature vacuum bond, and a carefully controlled process of ion beam milling. Bulk wave acoustic delay lines consisting of LiNbO3transducers on spinel substrate have yielded very wideband and low loss operation in S-, C- and X-band frequencies."

"A new and inexpensive method of computing the large and small-signal gain, the efficiency, and the saturated power for helix type TWT's has been developed. The input data to the analysis are the physical dimensions of the helix, the surrounding vacuum structure, and the properties of the electron gun. The small-slgnal analysis is based on a field analysis of S. F. Paik, and the large-signal analysis is based on curve-fitting to the original works of Nordsieck, Rowe, Tien, and Cutler and Brangaccio. Experimental data on two helix tubes operated over extended bandwidths have shown the equations to correlate to within about 0.5 dB in output power."
"A comparison of experimental results and some large signal computer programs has established a correlation wherein the beam in a crossed-field amplifier is non-laminar. This \"cycloiding\" beam reduces the efficiency from that predicted by large signal analysis using a Brillouin beam, but is still calculable with minor modification to an existing computer program. The C.F.A. efficiency can also be improved by a reduction in the degree of cycloiding by a modification of the beam injection."
"A computer program utilizing a system of polarization variables has been developed at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. This system differs from other variable systems because of its capacity to reduce and isolate the non-linearities in large signal klystron interaction theory calculations. This paper will discuss the basic idea behind polarization variables and discuss some interesting aspects of space charge, beam loading and output cavity impedance on the accuracy of analysis and required computation time of the program. The algorithm was designed to include relativistic effects and has been used for analysis on a broad range of klystrons at the accelerator center. The code has not only given Us confidence in its use as an analytic tool but has also allowed us to obtain our primary goal, that of designing and building state-of-the-art klystrons with peak power outputs in excess of 40 MW at 270 kV, and approaching 60 MW at 300 kV, with efficiencies well in excess of 50%.

The lateral current confinement is realized by using the difference of V-I characteristics between n-p-p-p and n-p-n-p structures. The ISP structure is made with both succesive solution growth techniques and selective diffusion techniques. Both near- and far-field patterns show single transverse-mode oscillation in the laser with 3-µm stripe width. The smallest active area of 2.5 µm (horizontal) × 0.6 µm (vertical) has been obtained. The transverse beam spreadbetween 50% peak intensity points is 30°. The polarization of laser emission is TE mode. The lowest threshold current obtained is 135 mA for the sample with 3-µm stripe width and 150-µm cavity length."
"Nonlinear optical interactions in the thin film waveguide have advantages for the high energy density inside the film as well as the phase matching capability between propagating modes. By use of vacuum-deposited ZnS thin film on the BK-7 glass substrate, experiments were performed on the harmonic generation of Nd:YAG laser to examine the nonlinearity of polycrystalline films. A Q-switched Nd:YAG laser beam at three wavelengths around 1.064µm with peak power of 3-5kW was focussed onto the prism coupler to excite the TE mode inside the film. The second harmonic wave as well as third harmonic wave were observed by this experiment, and this result demonstrates the large second Order nonlinearities in the orientated polycrystalline thin film waveguide."
"The IC-VCElocus predicted by a one-dimensional model of thermal instability is compared with the locus predicted by a numerical model which accounts for non-uniform heat generation over the transistor area and also two-dimensional heat flow within the heat sink. Both models include the effects of distributed emitter and base ballast resistance, as well as the magnitude and temperature dependence of current gain. An important result obtained from this comparison is that the forward safe operating areas (SOA) predicted by the two models are very nearly the same. This suggests that the one dimensional model can be used to predict a particular SOA, even though the assumptions used in its derivation are not valid at the onset of thermal instability. Confirmation of this approach has been obtained by demonstrating good agreement between measured SOA and that predicted by the one-dimensional model."
"A negative impedance transistor is described in which a gate on the oxide over the emitter-base junction and attached to the collector causes the collector current ICto decrease when VCEexceeds a critical value. For high VCE, ICeventually increases as breakdown is reached. When operated with a fixed external base current drive, the IC- VCEcharacteristic is similar in shape to the I-V characteristic of a tunnel diode. The ratio of the peak-to-valley current, and the voltage range over which the negative impedance effect occurs, are shown to be strongly dependent on the base surface concentration, oxide thickness, and the external base current drive. Two models are presented which predict the variation in the base current with gate voltage in terms of base surface recombination and surface potential. These models may be extended to describe the variation in ICwith VCEfor a constant external base current drive. Two sample applications of the gated transistor are presented."
"The main thrust of this work was to develop new numerical methods to obtain viable solutions for the exact set of time-dependent equations that govern the dynamics of a metal-insulator-semiconductor system, Techniques were developed which resulted in self-consistent solutions over many orders of magnitude of time for the system of equations that describes the dynamics of electrons, holes, electrostatic potential and Shockley-Read-Hall trap, centers for the MIS device. The transient theory of the MOS capacitor has been attacked in depth. Several key results were obtained and these are compared to results obtained from existing theory."
"The drain current IDversus gate voltage VGof a MOST operating in weak inversion, and the influence of surface potential fluctuations on this characteristic have been studied before [1] The purpose of this paper is to derive an expression of the drain current IDversus the drain voltage VDfor long channel devices. It is demonstrated that the surface potential fluctuations don't affect the slope of the ID-VDcurve whereas the density NSSof surface states strongly influences the slope for small drain voltages. This yields a simple and useful technique to determine NSSon M.O.S. transistors."
"Storage of acoustic signals propagating along the surface of a piezoelectric crystal has been shown to be feasible. Previous experiments were performed at 30 MHz on Quartz, with a triode planar gun structure without any focusing electrode. In this paper, a new structure is described which has been designed to meet the requirement for higher-frequency operation (above 100MHz). Experimental results are given and comparison is made with other ways of increasing the capabilities of this storage device."
"Nonvolatile memories are now focused by many people. One of the most popular structure of the memories is an MNOS (metal-silicon nitride-silicon oxide-semiconductor) structure. However the structure has poor memory retention when B-T (80°c,-10V) stress is applied to the sample. The developed structures are MNCOS and MNCNOS (metal-over silicon nitride-silicon clusters-under silicon nitride-semiconductor), in which the silicon clusters are the small polycrystalline silicon particles having a compressed hemisphere. As the clusters act as trap centers of both holes and electrons, the trapping efficiency of censers increases, and the thicker silicon oxide film (tox= 50 - 60 A) is able to use for the better memory retention. The memories can operate more than ten years under the BT (-10V, 80°c) stress condition."
"Aluminum oxide formed by a method of electrotytic anodization, which is compatible with the existing planar silicon technology, has been used to fabricate MOS-FET structures with and without an initial layer of thermally grown silicon dioxide on n-type substrates. Fully anodized aluminum directly evaporated on the silicon surface results in devices with a positive threshold voltage. The same structure when over-anodized yields negative threshold voltage devices. C-V and I-V characteristics are analyzed for a physical understanding of the device operation."
"A nickel-chromium+gold (NiCr+Au) metallization system, consisting of a vacuum deposited 150 Å layer of NiCr underneath a 3000 Å layer of Au, has been used in the fabrication of p-channel enhancement mode transistors and integrated circuits. The devices exhibit both low VTH(-2.3 volts) and small shifts in threshold voltage (-.16 volts) due to ionic drift resulting from bias-temperature stress. These results for NiCr+Au devices which do not require passivation or heat treat are better than results obtained with similar devices which were gate oxide passivated, metallized with Al, and heat treated."
"This paper is concerned with showing the effects of process and structural variations on the characteristics of the double-diffused MOST(DMOST). Processing details, including boron diffusion in the absence of an oxidizing ambient, are presented for three structures, viz., etched self-aligned gate DMOST, symmetrical DMOST, and conventional non-symmetrical DMOST. Processes are varied to give different channel lengths, peak dopings and, different thresholds (to give both enhancement and depletion mode devices). The symmetrical device is shown to be a lower-frequency, lower voltage device than the non-symmetrical."
"This paper describes a low leakage n-channel Si gate FET. An n-doped polycrystalline Si field shield was used to achieve low junction leakage. Field shield and diffusion self-alignment was obtained by using a nitride-oxide insulator between the shield and the substrate. A gated diode structure and charge retention cell were used to characterize junction leakage. A -0.5 to -1.0 volt shield-to-substrate bias produced minimum junction leakage. Average minimum leakage, measured at 25°C and 9 volts reverse bias, was6.5\\times10^{-15}A/mil2; corresponding retention time of a charge retention cell was 158 sec. 300Å SiO2plus 300Å Si3N4was used for the gate dielectric. The silicon gate was dopea during the POCl3source-drain diffusion process. Average threshold voltage was 0.88 volts (at VSX= -3V); average normalized transconductance, 36.1 micromhos/volt, corresponds to an effective mobility of 525 cm2/V-sec. Devices made with a nitride-oxide gate insulator can exhibit a large threshold voltage shift when stressed at elevated temperatures. This shift is caused by the differential conductivity mechanism. The Vtshift is greatly reduced by annealing the Si3N4for 1 hr. in steam at 1000°C prior to silicon gate deposition. This anneal reduces the Vtshift from greater than 1V to less than 100mV for devices stressed at 14V, 165°C, and 500 hr."
"Transistor simulators, computer programs which calculate device characteristics as determined by materials properties and impurity profiles, can be employed directly in the performance evaluation of circuit designs. To be practical, two-dimensional effects must be included while simulation costs must not be prohibitive. The program TRANSIM (TRANsistor SIMulator), described in this paper, employs a highly efficient algorithm specialized for bipolar transistor simulation, which reduces simulation costs for one-dimensional analysis by an order of magnitude over previously published approaches. Two-dimensional effects are approximated without the complexity of a full two-dimensional analysis."
 "This paper describes the computer aided design and fabrication techniques used to realize an optimized X-band oscillator transistor. Transistor oscillator and amplifier performance data are presented."
"In this paper the characteristics and fabrication of implanted microwave transistors are discussed. By use of arsenic implanted emitter and boron implanted base, devices can be fabricated with fTbetween 4.0 and 7.0 GHz, while fmaxranges from 18.0 to 25.5 GHz. Noise figures range from 3.8 to 5.5 db at 4 GHz. Results will be presented from devices implanted with arsenio emitter energies from 27 to 30 KeV and boron base energies from 20 to 38 KeV. Boron base doses range from5 \\times 10^{12}to 1013B/cm2, while emitter dose was1 \\times 10^{15}to2 \\times 10^{15}As/cm2. It was found that (QE/DE)effranged from1.5 to 2.5 \\times 10^{13}cm-4sec for all emitter implants. A discussion of improvement of uniformity and yield is included along with some wafer yield data."
  "A high efficiency 100 watt traveling-wave tube amplifier for space communication at C-band, 5.9- 6.4 GHz, with integrated power supply and heat pipe cooling is described. The tube incorporates a helix slow wave structure with a velocity resynchronization taper and three-stage doubly-depressed collector for efficiency enhancement. The tube generates RF power at an overall efficiency of 50%, while the power conditioner maintains greater than 80% efficiency over line, load and temperature variations. The TWTA therefore delivers RF power at over 40% efficiency from an unregulated DC power line. High efficiency, as an integrated TWTA, is achieved without sacrifice of communication system type parameters such as AM/PM conversion, transfer curve linearity, and intermodulation distortion."
"A 12 GHz-coupled-cavity tube with PPM focusing is described which incorporates a double step velocity taper and a novel multi-stage collector with radiation cooling for efficiency enhancement. The tube achieves saturated power output of 240 watts over a bandwidth of 85 MHz with 35 dB gain and an overall efficiency of 56%. The multi-stage collector includes nine active beam collection stages and features electrostatic beams velocity sorting with automatic suppression of secondaries. Upon leaving the output coupler, the spent beam is expanded in a refocusing section to reduce space charge effects and radial velocity components before entering the multi-stage collector. Collector efficiencies of 81% have been, obtained at saturation. The refocusing section and multi-stage collector is based on a NASA-Lewis Research Center design."
         "An on-line electrical to optical input transducer capable of spatially modulating a collimated laser beam is a major element in a real-time coherent optical processor. The electron-beam addressed light valve has received considerable attention as such an image transducer. Real time correlation, spatial filtering and spectrum analysis have been demonstrated using this device. This paper emphasizes ferroelectric and conductivity measurements obtained for an electron-beam addressed KD2PO4crystal over the operating range from room temperature through the transition temperature to the crystal's Curie point. Since the device stores information at its -52°C operating temperature, real-time operation necessitates charge removal by secondary emission using a flood gun. Experimental data on the crystal's secondary emission curve, crossover potentials, and sticking potential will also be presented, and the effects of these device parameters on system operation, design, performance and lifetime will be discussed."
"An experimental setup of a pulsed dye laser for holographic applications is described. The dye laser was longitudinally excited with the frequency-doubled output of a Q-switched ruby laser. A dye laser output in a single TEMoomode, which was continuously tunable across a wide spectrum, was obtained. Thus, the implementation of the dye lasers to holography for many engineering, scientific, and biomedical applications is now possible. The capabilities of a pulsed dye laser for recording holograms are demonstrated."
"Accelerated life tests show that CdS/Cu2S solar cell lifetimes increase with lower temperature, cyclic light, and a nitrogen gas ambient. Extrapolated lifetimes for cells kept below 50°C in nitrogen gas with earth deployment exceed 20 years. Recovery of degraded cells in dark, 21°C environment were as high as 45%. Solar array power loss with shading is reduced as much as a factor of 2.3 by correct connection schemes and by as much as a 7.6 factor using protective diodes."
"A large volume (10 liters) photoinitiated chemical laser device based on the reaction between D2and F2has been operated on a pulsed basis an shown to have an overall electrical efficiency of 12% at a fill pressure of 300 Torr. Laser output was found to be linearly proportional to flashlamp energy over the range studied. With an input energy of 1700 J into two conventional xenon flashlamps, the laser output energy and pulse duration are 189 J and 15 µsec, respectively. This corresponds to a volumetric extraction efficiency of 48 J/liter-atm."
"A high power, short pulse CO2laser system has been constructed for target irradiation and materials damage studies at 10.6 µm. The system consists of a low energy short pulse CO2oscillator followed by a series of high gain amplifiers. Output energies of 30 J in a nanosecond pulse have been achieved."
 "A cold-cathode electron gun was used to produce the ionization for a CO2laser. Gain coefficients in excess of 5% cm-1were obtained at 5 and 7 atm. Output energy densities of about 60 joules liter-1atm-1were obtained at 1 and 2 atm from an 8-liter oscillator."
"Methods are discussed for improving the tunability and mode control of a high pulse-energy HF/DF laser. An unstable resonator configuration and laser operation at high pressure are described."
"The gas plasma technique was applied to the etching of Si3N4, poly-Si, SiO2and the multi-layer films in fabrication of MOS-LSI. For Si3N4film in the selective oxidation process, the so-called side-etching can be controlled from negative, zero to positive, by varying the plasma conditions. The Al-gate MOS-LSI's fabricated by this process work well and havegood reliability, and their wafer yield was better than that of devices fabricated by the process using the wet-chemical etching. The gas plasma technique could give the tapered etching of poly-Si film in the Si-gate process and also smooth edges without under-cutting in the multi-layer structures including the MNOS and SNOS. SiO2films could be etched successfully by the gas plasma technique, but the processing time may be too long depending on processes."
"It is widely known that the best way to reduce input bias current for integrated amplifiers is to employ p-channel MOS transistors as input devices. In comparison with bipolar amplifiers, however, conventional MOS input amplifiers have a fatal drawback in stability. What is worse, they require high supply voltage, because the threshold voltage of MOS transistors is high. These two major drawbacks have been generally attributed to PSG (phosphosilicate glass) which is commonly utilized as a passivation film in integrated circuits --- the first one being due to its polarization phenomenon, and the second one due to its gettered positive charges. This paper describes a newly developed passivation technique, which replaces the PSG film. The technique is based upon barrier and gettering properties of Ta, Ta oxide and Al oxide with respect to ionic contamination. This structure can be obtained by preferential anodization of successively evaporated Ta and Al films, which realizes \"the Planar Interconnection\" at the same time. Applying this technique to MOS input operational amplifiers, above-mentioned drawbacks have been eliminated. As a result, the stability of initial and long-term operation and the immunity from the external noise have been improved. Furthermore, the operable supply voltage has been widened to the range of V± = ±3V ------ ±18V."
"A boron ion implant protects the thick-oxide field regions of n-channel MOSFETs by penetrating the thick oxide and increasing the doping at the silicon interface. Active devices, with thin oxide in their gate regions, are not greatly affected because the implant lies buried beneath their channels. The method is compatible with standard four-mask FET processing, adding no new masking steps. Measurements of field properties were made on FET devices with thick oxides in their gate regions. Measurements are also reported for normal thin-oxide devices. The implant effect is characterized by the difference in properties between implanted and unimplanted devices on the same wafers. the degree of protection as a function of both implant dose and energy is reported over a wide range. The results are compared with calculations that accurately account for the nonuniform profile, with good agreement. Field protection, as measured by the thick-oxide threshold voltage, has a sharp peak at a well-defined energy. At energies below the peak, too many ions stop in the oxide; above the peak, they lie too deep in the silicon. Threshold voltages and transconductance of thin-oxide devices are unaffected, but the threshold voltage sensitivity to substrate bias is increased somewhat."
"Ion implantation of11B+directly into the channel region was used to adjust the threshold voltage of n-channel enhancement mode FETs. Implantation was performed through a 500Å gate oxide grown during a standard four-mask FET process. Threshold voltage shift was determined as a function of implant dose and energy by measuring the difference in threshold voltage between implanted and unimplanted devices on the same wafer. Threshold voltage shift varied sublinearly with implant dose. These are believed to be the first results reported accurate enough to show this effect. Threshold voltage shift for a given dose is also reduced as implant energy (or channel depth) is increased. These results are easily understood in terms of a simple model in which the collapse of the depletion region at inversion, due to the additional doping in the channel, partially compensates for this additional doping. Data are compared with a numerical solution that for the first time fully accounts for the nonuniform doping profile, with excellent agreement."
"Two CCD's, one 2 bits long and one 64 bits long, were fabricated from silicon on sapphire wafers. The 2-bit device is a resistive gate structure which can be operated ten times faster (2 MHz) than the normal structure of the same size. The reason is found to be due to the special structure of the resistive gate structure. The 64-bit device is processed on bulk silicon so that a direct comparison can be made. Both SOS and bulk silicon can be operated at 20 MHz or higher. At high-frequency operation, both devices have about the same transfer efficiency. But at the low-frequency end, the SOS device shows the dark current to be very high with the device barely operating at 600 KHz."
 "A numerical integration of Poisson's equation and the current equation is performed using the constant hole density at the Schottky barrier as a boundary condition. The resulting small-signal device admittances are in good agreement with experimentally observed values. Better negative conductance is predicted at low current densities when the phase shift near the Schottky barrier is included in the analysis."
"In a recent paper, the oscillator performance of GaAs Schottky-Read diodes of the type metal - n1n2n+was given (4). Efficiencies as high as 26% were observed at X-band for a ratio n1/n2≈ 25. The tuning characteristics of these diodes differ considerably from conventional IMPATTS which have uniform doping profiles. In addition, the Schottky-Read diodes have proved to be difficult to use in microstrip amplifier circuits, particularly at high rf input levels. Small and large signal admittance measurements were made at frequencies from 4 to 12 GHz for different dc current levels on a number of diodes with differing profiles, I-V characteristics, and oscillator performance. The results were compared with those obtained for conventional IMPATTS. In addition, the effect of structural variations on breakdown voltage and depletion depth were calculated."
"Silicon double-drift IMPATT diodes with both drift regions implanted into π (undoped) epi on p+substrates are discussed. By incorporating doubly-charged ions, frequency coverage, has been extended down to 40 GHz. The π epitaxial material was characterized by spreading resistance measurements so that the ions were implanted into a completely defined host material lattice. RF test results at 55 GHz comparing single-and double-drift diodes are given. Noise figure measurements show that the transition from small- to large-signal behavior begins at a power output ∼ 3 dB greater with double-drift diodes. At reasonable outputs this results in ∼ 10 dB noise improvement (1)."
"A silicon IMPATT diode has been developed for use in a one-watt transmitter amplifier and for local oscillator applications in the 6-GHz common carrier band. The procedure for optimizing the design and establishing diode specifications is outlined. The development of a semi-automated test set for rapid and reliable measurements of large-signal admittance, power and noise is described. Accelerated DC and RF aging studies predict a median lifetime greater than 107hours for the final design diode at a nominal junction operating temperature of 200°C."
"Constant stress (temperature) operating tests have been conducted on silicon Ka-band diodes. Statistics of failure fit a lognormal distribution except near the early-failure tail; deviations are ascribed to manufacturing process non-uniformities. Analysis of failed devices shows a single predominant failure mechanism, gold contamination of the p-n junction area, observable at junction operating temperatures between 230°C and 350°C."
"The dependence of avalanche noise on the device structure, junction curvature, operating conditions and material parameters is studied systematically. AM and FM noise of oscillators and optimum noise measure of stable amplifiers under high-power conditions as functions of RF power, dc current density, frequency and avalanche region width are presented."
"This paper summarizes several results from a comprehensive study of TE device noise properties. The general noise analysis of Sweet for a TE device in a simple parallel resonant circuit has been extended to include both bias and RF voltage variation of the nonlinear device admittance. The RF components of AM and FM noise become coupled and the video component of FM noise is altered as a result of introducing the RF voltage dependence o This theory has been applied to a particular TE device model interacting with a detailed RF circuit model for an X-band waveguide cavity. The variations of the video and RF components of AM and FM noise have been computed as functions of load conductance, bias voltage, cavity tuning and doping density for uniformly doped devices. This paper includes a brief discussion of the theory and some of the variations of video noise components of AM and FM noise."
"Recent studies of large area EBS diodes for use in a 1 kW 500 MHz CW application are given. Power dissipation of 55 watts CW on a 4 mm2diode has been obtained in excess of 1000 hours with no degradation in reverse voltage characteristics. At higher diode dissipation, current runaway was observed, and this was shown to be a function of the power dissipated in the diode, independent of diode voltage and current over a 100% change in diode voltage and current. The maximum diode dissipation has been related to voids in the braze to the heat sink. Diodes with void-free bonds have shown dissipation levels in excess of 100 watts CW but were limited by degassing problems in the tube. Failure with some void-free bonded EBS diodes was related to breakdown of small (\\sim 3-10µm) high conductive regions of the diodes observed with a Scanning Electron Microscope. Auger surface analysis has traced this to a possible residual phosphorus contamination on the top p layer due to removal of excess Al metallization during fabrication."
"During the earlier development of EBS devices, degradation mechanisms imposed severe limitations on achievable performance and operating life. Essentially all of the difficulties have been overcome and a number of devices have now operated for many thousands of hours at high average power with no failures. The objective of the work described in this paper was to determine the various failure modes in electron bombarded semiconductor devices, to design diode configurations which eliminate the known degradation mechanisms, to test diodes for reliable operation under electron bombardment, and to develop compatible semiconductor and vacuum tube processing methods. The life tests verify that the effort was successful."
"A pulse amplifier EBS (Electron Bombarded Semiconductor) utilizing a grid controlled electron beam to produce an amplified current in a reverse biased semiconductor diode has been developed. Output pulses of up to 400 V with a 3 nanosecond risetime are produced with this device. The design of the electron gun and the semiconductor diode used in the EBS pulse amplifier are described along with a technique for simultaneously vacuum processing several devices. Static operating characteristics for the EBS pulse amplifier over a wide range of diode voltages and output currents are discussed, and the effect of the choice of operating point on the transient response of the EBS pulse amplifier is considered."
"Electron-beam-semiconductor (EBS) targets can be constructed from pn-junction or Schottky-barrier diodes. Most applications described so far have employed the first type of diode. This paper describes the performance and current-gain calculations for Schottky-barrier EBS targets. Experiments and theory show that the current gain of Schottky-barrier diodes is generally greater than that of pn-junctions. Approximate calculations also indicate that the absence of the p+ layer increases significantly the maximum operating frequency of these diodes. The measured current gain characteristics for silicon, gallium-arsenide and gallium-arsenide-phosphide (Ga As0.7P0.3) Schottky-barrier EBS targets are in excellent agreement with theory. Typical current-gains are in the range of 2000 at beam voltages of 12 kv. The performances of the Schottky diodes are compared with those of pn-Junctions for the three semiconductor materials. An important result of these experiments is the derivation of the energies per electron-hole pair for gallium-arsenide (4.6 ev) and gallium-arsenide-phosphide (4.8 ev). It is also shown that Schottky-barrier EBS targets are better suited for measurement of those energies than pn-junctions."
"The printed circuit TWT is a low cost microwave amplifier specifically designed for applications such as phased-array radars where large numbers of tubes are required. The original successful printed circuit TWT provided 20 watts of power at L-band, and used a single printed meanderline for its microwave interaction circuit. For higher power and higher frequency operation, multiple circuits must be used. A study of the various modes that can exist on a multiple circuit slow-wave structure led to the successful construction of a 1.5 kw peak power printed circuit TWT at S-band. The mode study, the high power S-band tube, and a 100 watt peak power X-band multiple circuit tube will be discussed in the paper."
  "Summary form only given, as follows. This invited review deals solely with solidstate light emitters, and excludes work on plasma panels and subtractive displays. GaP LEDs were pioneered in the UK in the early 1960's and still receive much attention. Conventional red and green devices are in production. Research is concentrating on new fabrication techniques. GaAsP diodes are also in production. Research proceeds also on these additional materials: GainP, GaN, ZnSe, ZnS, and rare-earth phosphors (used as photon energy up-converters on GaAs IR diodes). ZnSe diodes are MIS structures. Since LEDs are too expensive for large displays, the UK program has concentrated on ZnS dc electroluminiscent powder panels. These various areas of work will be set in perspective in the talk given at the conference."
"Monolithic displays in GaP can provide potentially low power, high brightness, red or green display devices. Three basic device configurations (planar, mesa, dome) have been analyzed to determine their relative effectiveness for use in monolithic applications. The basic device structures have been fabricated from GaP wafers prepared by double liquid phase epitaxy. These structures have been studied to identify any inherent technological limitations associated with their fabrication."
"A GaAs:Si-GaAsP heterostructure chip coated with NaYF4:Yb,Er phosphor has been fabricated to demonstrate a multi-color operation. The one-chip LEDs with a double junction showed a centro-symmetrical distribution of the light intensity of the each color, and assured uniformity of intermediate hue between green and red by adjusting the thickness of the phosphor. The brightness of green and red was more than 1OO ft.L at the current density of 20 A/cm2and the power efficiency was2 \\sim 3 \\times 10^{-4}for green. The brightness of the green light was lower than that of 250 fL at 20 A/cm2for a single LED, because of the refraction of infrared light in the GaAsP layer."
"Thermally stimulated current (T.S.C.) measurements have been performed, on p-n junctions in GaP LED's grown by double liquid phase epitaxy. By studying appropriate junctions, we have been able to observe four deep donors (the energy level of which ranges between 0.27eV and. 0.90eV) on the n-side of the junction and four deep acceptors (the energy level of which ranges between 0.22eV and 0.55eV) on the p-side. A correlation has been established between the presence and concentration of some of these deep states and the quantum efficiency of the corresponding LED in case of pn+structure. Increase of the intensity or appearance of the peaks has been observed in the T.S.C. spectrum when the LED's are degraded by heating under forward bias."
"A number of products have been introduced which make use of the response of nematic liquid crystal which has a positive dielectric anisotropy. Because of the large range of materials which are now available, device design can now be varied to include applications which were not previously available. New devices designed must take into consideration speed of response, electrical breakdown and voltage threshold and as all of these parameters are interrelated some engineering compromises become necessary. This paper will develop the scientific basis for the engineering compromises needed in the design of a number of liquid crystal displays. A review of available displays and their threshold voltages will be presented. The breakdown voltage limitations as a function of the thickness of the displays as well as the speed of response will be discussed."
"A discrete-element reflective display, called a Liquid Crystal Pictorial Display, is discussed. The display consists of a thin layer of liquid crystal (LX) material which is contained between a transparent conductive cover and a large semiconductor substrate containing a matrix array of electrically controlled reflective electrodes. Picture element brightness is dependent upon the optical scattering characteristics of the liquid crystal material in the presence of an electric field formed by the controlled elemental electrode. Television imagery has been demonstrated in shades of gray, in real-time, at a resolution density of 100 picture elements per inch, on a liquid crystal cell approximately one by one inch, in extent. The liquid crystal cell represents a major advance in the state of the art in pictorial displays because it offers a solid-state display which for the first time modulates the incident illumination rather than attempting to compete with it as in the case of the cathode-ray tube or with light-emitting diode displays."
"Neodymium doped CaLaSOAP has properties intermediate between Nd:YAG and Nd:Glass that make it desirable for use as a pulsed-mode-locked oscillator at 1.06 µ. Time resolve spectroscopy, high speed image converter streak recordings, and two photon flourescence pulse duration measurements were used to investigate the output of such a laser. Pulse duration from 5 to 15 psec were observed under different operating conditions. By varying the internal intensity of the oscillator, self-phase modulation was observed to change in extent from bandwidth limited operation to controlled phase modulation, and finally to the stage where the pulse began to break up."
 "A new method of pulse selection and shaping is described, utilizing the reflection and attenuation of a gas breakdown event. Using 10.6-µm wavelength radiation breakdown, plasma reflectivities of 4-8% were measured and the reflected pulses showed a risetime faster than the 3.1-nsec response time of the detection system. Calculations of the time-dependent growth of the electron concentration leading up to breakdown, together with a simple model of the plasma reflectivity, predict pulse risetimes of 4 psec and 0.15 nsec for breakdown induced by ramping pulses of 1-nsec and 100-nsec duration, respectively. Experimental conditions favoring the attainment of these fast risetimes. are discussed."
"Pulse compression is discussed as one possible means to overcome the pulse energy limitations imposed by self focusing in high power solid laser systems. Linear and nonlinear processing techniques are compared. In linear systems, a short oscillator pulse is expanded, chirped, and shaped entirely by linear dispersive and filter elements. It is then re-compressed after being amplified. In nonlinear systems, the oscillator pulse is long, and the chirp is created by self phase modulation in a Kerr liquid. A comparison is made between the Gires-Tournois interferometer and the grating pair for use in high energy pulse compression."
"The first laser pellet fusion approaches emphasized inertial confinement with heating by nanosecond laser pulses. The large energy required for breakeven with this approach has led more recent research to concentrate on pellet compression approaches which result in more realizable energy requirements but also demand shorter pulse durations (\\sim 10^{-10}sec). Self focusing dominates in this latter time regime and changes the optimum point for conversion from rod to disc amplifiers. In the course of reoptimizing a CGE VD-640 for subnanosecond operation it became clear that it was worthwhile to consider a helically pumped disc amplifier rather than linear pumping geometries. This paper compares the operation of a helically pumped 43 mm aperture disc amplifier to an equivalent linearly pumped amplifier as well as to an equivalent rod amplifier."

"Several approaches to the operation of automated ground transport systems for urban use are presented and evaluated. Such systems have been suggested principally in response to the problems of urban traffic congestian and are often proposed as solutions to such problems. Thus this paper, the first of a series of three, discusses the problems of urban transportation and their origins, identifying as the principal elements the institutional structure, urban geography, and design of facilities for urban automotive transport. Importantly, the origins of a significant portion of \"the urban transportation problem\" lie outside the transport sector. Six potential applications for automated transport systems are suggested, ranging from specialized single-link \"horizontal elevators\" to general-purpose wide-area networks."
"The control problems associated with the operation of a network of automatically controlled closely spaced high-speed vehicles are considered. A system operating concept based on the synchronous moving-cell approach to individual vehicle control is presented. The need for a network traffic-management strategy is pointed out and one such strategy, called cycle preprogramming, is discussed. Finally, a study of the efficiency of the cycle preprogramming traffic-management strategy is described."
"This paper is a digest of the electrical system section of a report [8] on the feasibility of using a hybrid heat engine/electrical propulsion system as a means of reducing exhaust emissions from street-operated vehicles. The electrical system is composed of an electric traction motor, a generator, control system, and batteries. Batteries are not covered in this paper, but the remainder of the items will be treated here. First, the electrical system parameters or characteristics that have the greatest impact on the total system are considered; next, details of the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches are summarized; and, finally, development efforts are recommended."

"In this paper we define the service area of VHF/UHF land mobile and broadcast stations and demonstrate graphical and computer methods to determine and present such areas as a function of known equipment parameters and of a propagation model derived largely from an extensive measurement program over irregular terrain."
"A new navigation system and corresponding equipment components for straight steering of a convoy of snow vehicles traveling on the Antarctic plateau is described. On the polar plateau, magnetic compass readings become unreliable, and the surface of snow does not have any distinct target for determination of direction. This new system consists of one guide vehicle situated at the end of the convoy and a pilot vehicle at the head of the convoy. The guide vehicle has two transmission antennas that each transmit alternately. The patterns of these two antennas overlap on the centerline, providing a right-left guidance capability. The pilot vehicle detects this signal and from it determines his correct bearings. The equipment for this system must be protected from the violent vibrations of the snow vehicle. Transistorized equipment designs were therefore selected to meet these requirements."
"The Automatic Route Control System (ARCS) is a self-contained on-board system that directs the operation of a conventional motor vehicle over predetermined routes and controls activities (such as the delivery or pickup of items) performed along the route. In effect, the system continuously measures the vehicle's location coordinates, compares these with the route coordinates, and then issues audio, visual, and/or printed instructions appropriate to the location. The system also detects driver errors and prescribes corrective action. The routes to be followed and the actions to be taken are defined on interchangeable magnetic tape cartridges, which may be updated daily or as required from a computerized central file. ARCS enables a driver to operate efficiently over a complex route without reference to maps or lists and without prior knowledge of the route. It also eliminates tedious manual report preparation because computer-ready data for route accounting can be acquired on a magnetic tape cartridge. Although applicable to most types of operations carried out over routes that can be defined in advance, the prototype application is for the delivery of newspapers. Installed in a van with paper throwers stationed at special windows on each side, the system signals each thrower with a tone through headphones at the proper time to throw papers to individual subscribers while driving through residential areas at 15-30 mi/h."

"For effective protection of automobile occupants in high-speed collisions, passive restraints (such as airbags) must be actuated prior to impact. A 10-GHz CW homodyne bistatic radar system has been developed to permit exploration of the feasibility of such an application. System design and response to potential real and false-alarm targets and to the automotive environment are delineated. Possible elaborations on the basic system are described."

"A multiple branch predetection combining diversity receiver technique using pulse-envelope modulation of the transmitted signal is described. The receiver branches use the \"STAR\" scheme of multiple heterodyning of the received signal with itself to eliminate all exponential modulation components imparted by the transmission medium. Each branch can be shown to be mathematically equivalent to a simple square-law detector. A modulation scheme using low-bit-rate (50 kHz) companded delta modulation is proposed which provides a reasonable output signal-to-noise ratio (30-40 dB). The convenience of received signal gain control before pulse regeneration and the possible application of conjugate phase retransmission could make this technique useful."
"In this paper the total bit-error probability using square-law detection of an on-off keyed carrier received through a fading medium is calculated. It is shown that the use of diversity will recover much of the performance loss caused by the fading, provided that an optimum decision threshold is used. Consideration is given to the performance obtained with a fixed optimum threshold (depending only on the mean-square signal strength) and to that obtained with two forms of variable threshold, assumed to follow the instantaneous fading signal strength. Compared to the fixed optimum threshold, the best variable threshold results in a 5- or 2.5-dB reduction in the required rms SNR for a 10-4error rate with two- or four-branch diversity, respectively; as compared to the no fading case, use of the fixed threshold requires 3 dB more SNR for a 10-4error rate with four-branch diversity, and requires 32 dB more SNR if only a single branch is used. A calculation of the average fade duration of the diversity-combiner output-signal component shows that diversity reduces the average time that the signal component spends below the threshold according to N-1/2for N branches. This is true for both the fixed or the best variable threshold, but the average duration with the fixed threshold is larger by about [log (1+σρ2)]1/2, where σρ2is the mean-square SNR per branch."
"A UHF mobile telephone system using digital modulation is described. The system uses on-off keying of an 836-MHz carrier, the code being supplied by an adaptive delta coder with a clock frequency of 50 kHz. The maximum audio baseband signal-to-noise ratio is approximately 30 dB. The mobile receiver employs space diversity in a maximal-ratio combiner. Due to the use of amplitude modulation of the carrier rather than exponential modulation, the diversity receiver is very simple. The system was tested in the laboratory and in the field. Field tests were made in suburban and urban areas. For the four-branch system, threshold occurred at an average IF signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 12 dB."
"The effect of background noise on the performance of phase-trilateration urban vehicle-monitoring systems is discussed. An expression for the density function of the error as a function of such system parameters as carrier-to-noise ratio, frequency deviation, observation time, and bandwidth is derived."

"Although the capability for mobile radio communication has been available for some time, the last few years have seen an increase in interest in this subject, particularly with respect to system design and development. One reason for this renewal of interest has been US FCC Docket 18 262, promising to reallocate the upper end of the UHF television band (channels 70-83) for mobile radio communication. In 1968, the FCC opened Docket 18 262, proposing to double the spectrum for private systems by the allocation of an additional 40 MHz, and to bring the common-carrier service into parity by the allocation of 75 MHz. Although the outcome is still pending, this possibility of serving what is recognized to be a large pent-up demand has stimulated research and development. While there have been significant advances in the state-of-art over the last thirty years, particularly in the area of equipment technology, until recently, the lack of spectrum has discouraged innovation in system architecture. There are not very many operational variations possible for a system with one channel, or at most a dozen. But the flexibility inherent in a contiguous block of 800 channels provides the capability for sophisticated systems with vastly increased spectrum efficiency. And, as described in papers in this issue, such system designs have been forthcoming."
"The author alleges that there is no shortage of radio spectrum, but rather, a shortage of new concepts in spectrum usage. The recent reallocation of additional frequencies to land mobile radio uses (FCC Dockets 18 261 and 18 262) provides new opportunities for innovative approaches, approaches that are free of the constraints of existing rules and regulations, existing manufacturing and engineering processes and concepts. Intending to be provocative and to initiate action and dialogue, the author challenges the technologists of this industry to come forward with innovative approaches based upon thorough, objective engineering analyses. The FCC, he contends, sorely needs factual, objective data from industry technologists in order to make the best decisions possible."
"A variety of land mobile radio systems are compared by their spectral and economic efficiencies in providing various user services. System types covered are private one-channel, shared repeater one channel, controlled-access one-channel, trunked multi-channel, and cellular. Spectral efficiency is defined to be the number of mobile users that can be served per MHz of spectrum in a core urban area, while economic efficiency is the average system cost per mobile. Both efficiencies vary with the type of usage, hence they are calculated for three major usages-mobile telephone service, dispatch service emergency, and dispatch service nonemergency. Services are described via seven \"service parameters,\" namely call holding time (average), tolerable average wait for channel access, peak busy hour utilization per mobile, audio quality (S/N), noise levels tolerable, and service range. Sensitivity of the basic results to variations in the service parameters are also computed and discussed."
"Small scale statistics of multipath propagation in a heavily built-up urban mobile radio environment are presented. The statistics cover vehicle travel distances on the order of 30 m along streets. Measuring equipment time delay resolution is about 0.1 µs. In some locations, paths with significant amplitudes are observed with excess delays of 9 to 10 µs. The delay spreads (√second central moment of power delay profile) in this environment are on the order of 2 µs. Often the signal at fixed delays has a Rayleigh-distributed amplitude but large departures from the Rayleigh distribution also occur. From the measurements it appears reasonable to model the urban mobile radio channel as a Gaussian quasi-wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering channel within a bandwidth of 10 MHz and for intervals along the street of up to 30 m."
"Field measurements of mobile radio signals have shown that signal arrival is concentrated in elevation angles lower than 16°. This suggests use of an omnidirectional antenna with vertical directivity, instead of the usual whip antenna, to increase average signal strength as a further improvement in the advantages of diversity reception."
"Measurements of signal attenuation were made from a suburban hilltop base station to a mobile vehicle on several streets in the surrounding countryside. Measurements of signal strength were simultaneously made in the winter of 1971 at frequencies of 836 MHz and 11.2 GHz and then repeated in the summer to determine the effects of foliage. The presence of foliage reduced the received signal strength and the effect was more pronounced at X-band than at UHF. In cases where the shadowing obstacle was tree covered, signal levels at UHF might typically be 10 dB lower when the trees were in full leaf, whereas at X-band this additional loss could be as high as 20 dB. The experimental data was compared to values predicted by knife-edge diffraction and reasonable agreement was found."
"A commonly used model for signal fading in many types of communication channels is that the amplitude of the received signal at a given time is a Rayleigh-distributed random variable. In this paper we show how classical statistical techniques may be applied to the problem of estimating the Rayleigh distribution parameter (i.e., the mean), given samples from the distribution. In particular, we first consider the problem of estimating the population mean, given a sequence of independent samples. We derive an unbiased maximum-likelihood estimator. We show that this estimator is unique, and since it is based on a sufficient statistic, it is therefore \"best\" in the Blackwell-Rao sense of minimizing expected loss. Using this estimator, we then develop confidence intervals whose length can be used as a guide in selecting the required sample size. We then consider the same estimation problem when the signal samples are obtained from the output of a logarithmic receiver. We derive an interval estimator which does not require taking the antilogs of the log samples, and which is not appreciably worse than the \"best\" estimator."
"The correlation between signals received by two mobile radio base-station antennas is investigated to determine spacing requirements for space diversity. Measurements of the fading of UHF signals received by two base-station horn antennas oriented at different angles with respect to the incoming mobile radio signal were made for different antenna spacings. The experimental results are compared with an analytical expression derived in this paper; they agree fairly well. A further experiment was made after removing the possible local scatterers surrounding the base station. Comparing these two experimental results, we find that the following are true. 1) Propagation in the direction of a line connecting the two base-station antennas is the critical case and requires a large separation of 70 wavelengths. As soon as the incoming wave is 10° away from the in-line axis, the spacing requirement drops to 30 wavelengths. 2) Local scatterers at the base station tend to decrease the correlation between signals received at the two antennas. We conclude that an upper limit to the spacing of antennas used for diversity can be obtained and that it is within the achievable range."
"This paper describes in detail the criteria for the design of a mobile laboratory for the characterization and measurement of man-made electromagnetic noise in the urban, suburban, and rural environment. A significant difference from previous similar measurements is the bandwidth of the receiving system, which is here of the order of 1 MHz. A simple model is proposed to describe the impulsive noise together with a series of experiments to validate the model and determine the significant necessary parameters. The detailed requirements for each of the subsystems of the mobile laboratory are discussed and some typical results obtained in trial runs are presented."
"Analytically tractable statistical-physical models of man-made noise environments have been constructed [1]-[3]. These permit quantitative description of the various types of electromagnetic interference appearing in typical radio receivers and, in particular here, for the communication links employed in mobile transportation systems and urban environments generally. This paper presents a summary of some of the principal analytical results obtained to date [1], [4], and includes some suggested next steps for joint theoretical and experimental study of these increasingly important phenomena. First-order probability density functions (pdf's) and probability distributions (pd's) are obtained explicitly; (higher order pdf's and pd's may also be found by similar methods) [2]. These models are based on a Poisson distribution of sources in space. The approach is canonical, in that the results are, in form, independent of particular emitted waveforms, propagation conditions, source distributions, beam patterns, and specific system parameters, as long as the interference is narrow-band following (at least) the aperture and/or the RF stages of a typical receiver. Considered here only are the cases of communication interference, where source and receiver bandwidths are comparable. The paper concludes with a short discussion of some features of suggested future interaction between theory and experiment."
"This paper describes an adaptive retransmission system capable of providing a UHF (1 GHz) mobile radio channel with \"two-way diversity.\" The system is unique in that all signal processing associated with the diversity combining is done at the base station. A two-branch prototype of the system, without modulation, was field tested to determine its adaptive retransmission performance. These tests indicate that the statistics of the fading envelope at both the base and mobile stations closely agree with those predicted by theory for an equal gain combiner with correlation between the branches."
"Using simulated Rayleigh-fading FM signals, the baseband performance of a diversity system that uses a separate pilot is studied. The effect of various RF/audio bandwidth expansion ratios is included. These results show an approach to a constant asymptotic baseband SNR for large expansion ratios, with diversity increasing this asymptote by 5 dB in the case of moderate to large interference and/or RF noise levels (9 to 15 dB below the carrier), to over 10 dB in the case of lower impairment levels (21 to 27 dB below the signal level). Assuming the usual hex-cell radio coverage plan, and a propagation law of the form r-n, n = 3 or 4, bandwidth expansion ratios of about three to six seem to yield the most efficient RF spectrum utilization in many practical situations. The number of required channel subsets (cells) is strongly influenced by the propagation law ranging from about 19 for n = 3, to about 7 for n = 4."
"A theoretical and experimental comparison of performance has been made between two types of predetection switching space diversity mobile radio systems. This comparison was made at a frequency of 840 MHz using simulated Rayleigh fading for a vehicle speed of about 80 mi/h. The switch diversity system was a conventional receiver antenna switching technique with two simulated physically separated receiving antennas and a single transmitting antenna. The feedback diversity system used a single receiving antenna with two simulated physically separated transmitting antennas. The transmitting antennas were switched remotely from the receiver. The difference in the performance of the two systems was shown to be primarily due to time delay inherent in the remote antenna switching technique."
"A low cost switched diversity receiving system has been developed for use in UHF-FM mobile radio. The input of a single receiver is switched back and forth between two antennas upon command from a signal level sensing logic circuit. The system has been measured on simulated Rayleigh fading channels and has been found to give a significant improvement to both voice and data signals."
"Diversity reception techniques can help to combat fast fading in urban areas, and this paper describes some predetection combining systems designed to be compatible with existing standard receivers. Quantitative results show that a worthwhile improvement in quality of reception can be Obtained with small numbers of antennas. There are advantages to be gained if, in future receiving systems, the diversity technique is incorporated directly into the receiver design."
"Federal Communication Commission Docket 18 262 allocated a 75-MHz band to the common carriers to implement high capacity mobile telephone systems. The Bell System has proposed a cellular arrangement of low-power transmitters/receivers that permits frequency reuse in a coverage area. This method of achieving spectrum efficiency will require extensive centralized coordination and control to properly administer channel assignments and to interconnect the mobiles with each other and with the direct distance dialing (DDD) network. This can be accomplished by means of an electronic switching system (ESS) with special data terminals and trunking arrangements, and a unique program. In the proposed plan the radio sites (base stations) act effectively as remote concentrators in the frequency domain under the control of ESS, which in turn acts primarily as a trunk-to-trunk switcher. In addition to the usual switching, signaling, and supervising functions, the switching office must also perform numerous special functions including paging of mobiles, location of mobiles (signal strength and ranging data analysis), channel reassignment of mobiles, and reswitching of mobiles to various base stations-these last three occurring while customers ate talking."
"Cellular mobile radio systems have been proposed that use many base stations to provide radio service over a large geographical area. In such systems, a stored-program processor assigns radio channels to base stations in real time, under certain interference constraints. The capacity and the queueing characteristics of the overall system are strongly dependent on the processor algorithms that are used. This paper presents three algorithms which are in a certain minimax sense statistically optimum. The procedures are quite general, and may be applied to any system that employs many servers, the use of some combinations of which is not allowed. The first algorithm provides for the preferential assignment of a \"standard\" channel. If all standard channels are busy, a \"nonstandard\" channel is selected in such a manner that the probability of blocking is minimized in that interferable facility most likely to suffer blocking. The second algorithm provides for the transfer of service from non-standard to standard channels whenever standard channels become free. The choice of the particular nonstandard channel to be freed is again made in a manner which minimizes the maximum probability of future blockage. The third algorithm provides for the rearrangement of channel assignments in those instances when all assignable channels, both standard and nonstandard, are busy. Such rearrangement can cause channels to become available under certain circumstances. If more than one rearrangement is possible, again the choice of what particular action should be taken is governed by the goal of minimizing the maximum probability of future blockage. All three algorithms attain short-term optimality by enumeration; that is, each candidate for assignment is considered in turn. Under the condition that the given candidate is selected, the conditional probability of future blocking in each of the server groups is calculated, and the maximum of these probabilities is associated with the candidate. After all candidates have been considered, that candidate which has the minimum associated probability is assigned. These algorithms produce, by definition, an instantaneous system state which is always optimum in the above minimax sense. In systems with large numbers of servers, the system changes state rapidly; thus, occasional short-term errors disappear rapidly, and short-term optimization tends to lead to peak performance in the long term as well."
"This paper reports the results of an investigation of the increase in traffic capacity in a cellular high capacity mobile telecommunications system attainable with dynamic instead of fixed channel assignment. Three dynamic channel assignment algorithms were studied by simulation using a 21-cell hexagonal array as a representative system layout. Detailed results for each algorithm are presented. For the particular system studied, traffic capacity can be increased by approximately 25 percent with dynamic channel assignment. A general upper bound on this increase has been found."
"Large-scale mobile radio systems using dynamic channel REassignment switch the channels assigned to some of the calls in progress to maintain a nearly optimum separation between coverage areas simultaneously using the same channel. Dynamic channel REassignment produces a significant increase in channel occupancy. For example, in the systems studied, which have a uniform distribution of their fixed channels and were operated against a uniform spatial distribution of offered traffic, the channel occupancy was increased by 2/3 over a pure fixed channel assignment system at a blocking rate of one percent. This corresponds to a channel savings of about 40 percent for the same traffic carried at one percent blocking by the hybrid systems that were studied."
"If a server group carrying short-holding-time queued traffic at high blocking probability is combined with another server group carrying normal blocked-calls-cleared traffic at low blocking probability, the resulting mixed group will in many cases operate at an intermediate blocking probability. Thus the mixed group provides better service to the queued traffic, while degrading the service of the cleared traffic. If the random arrival characteristics of the short-holding-time traffic are suitably modified by delaying calls an appropriate time before service, then the grades of service for both types of traffic may be engineered independently. An example of a possible use of this technique of induced delay, the combining of dispatch and mobile-telephone traffic on the same set of radio channels in the High-Capacity Mobile Telecommunications System, is discussed."
"Many mobile telephone and personal paging systems require signaling simultaneously from multiple transmitters. This paper analyzes the factors that cause paging errors due to interference when the signaling format consists of audio tones sent simultaneously from two FM transmitters. The factors considered are: drift in carrier and modulation frequencies, and misequalization of land-line amplitude and audio delay. The following results are shown: 1) the interference errors are eliminated if the land lines are amplitude and phase equalized, 2)if the lines are not equalized but the modulation frequencies are equal, then the interference errors can be decreased by an order of magnitude if the transmitters are mistuned such that their difference carrier frequency is just greater than the modulation tone filter bandwidth in the receiver, and 3) if the modulation frequencies are slightly different, then the interference errors can be decreased somewhat by misequalizing the modulation indicies. It is then concluded that if the land lines are not equalized and the signaling tones are not exactly equal, the interference errors cannot be eliminated, but can be decreased by properly aligning the system."
"An often-discussed scheme for providing maximal ratio combining in mobile radio is to set the complex branch gain according to the amplitude and phase of a pilot sent with the carrier. The in-phase component of the branch signal in such a system has a simple double-exponential distribution. These and other relevant statistics are derived."
"Land mobile systems currently use vertically polarized antennas while trying to solve the problem of small sector signal variations, which are greater for vertical polarization than for either horizontal or circular polarization. This difference in small sector variations is shown from results of tests at 430 MHz. The variations at 900 MHz should be more rapid and have amplitudes at least as great as those shown for 450 MHz. At 900 MHz antennas can be made small for mobile service and the improvements noted here may spur developments in circularly polarized antennas."
"This paper deals with two aspects of the investigations of mobile data transmission. The first aspect shows the equipment for measuring and recording of parameters that influence the transmission. The second aspect shows the development of an analog simulation of the data transmission with the possibility of adjusting significant parameters independently. Finally the applicability of the model is verified by comparison between simulation and actual transmission."
"A simple device to simulate the Rayleigh distributed fast fading encountered in mobile radio is described and evaluated. The Rayleigh envelope statistics are obtained by adding two independent Gaussian noise sources in quadrature. The theoretical spectrum of the received signal is approximated by shaping the spectrum of the noise sources with filters. A design is given whose performance is shown to agree very closely with theory."

"The computerized frequency assignment program developed by the FCC Spectrum Management Task Force utilizes monitoring van1/ measured occupancy data and models for propagation, interference, and noise. The propagation model was constructed by the Technical Division of the FCC Office of the Chief Engineer from measured FM and television data2/ and National Bureau of Standards measurements in the UHF/VHF range.3/ The co-channel interference model uses commonly accepted signal ratios between desired and interfering signals. The adjacent channel interference model is based on performance characteristics furnished by the major Land Mobile (LM) equipment manufacturers. The receiver and transmitter intermodulation interference models and the noise model were taken from the Report of the Advisory Committee for the Land Mobile Services.4/ None of the models is considered immutable. All will be continuously updated."
"The Spectrum Management Task Force of the Federal Communications Commission was formed, in part, for the purpose of devising new methods of spectrum management. Initial efforts have been directed toward improved spectrum utilization in the Land Mobile Service (which includes a large number of different types of users on approximately 2,000 channels, assigned on a noncontinuous basis, on three bands (25 to 50 MHz or \"Low Band,\" 150 to 174 MHz or \"High Band,\" and 450 to 470 MHz or \"UHF Band\", with additional channels specifically provided by FCC action in the lower UHF television channels in certain metropolitan areas, and with additional frequency space to become available in the 900 MHz region, but with frequency congestion generally to be found in all large population centers, and apparent maldistribution of users upon available channels). One technique which is being applied to the overall problem is the mobile spectrum monitoring van designed to measure occupancy, transmission, and other parameters of the land mobile channels."
 "With the increasing demand for two-way radio communications, the limited available spectrum, and the limited number of available sites for base stations and repeaters, spectrum pollution has resulted. Noise, desensitization, and intermodulation products have risen to such a level of interference that many systems have been driven off the better sites. Antenna site management can help the site owner and the user to overcome some of these problems. This paper will discuss the problems found on large antenna sites and then, through a case history, present an actual site and show how management concepts helped to improve its operation."
 "The antenna configuration, and its mounting location on a vehicle affect its performance. When mounting locations other than the roof are used, system performance is degraded. This paper focuses on signal improvement through antenna selection. The radiation patterns illustrate that pattern distortion is the result of both the particular mounting location and the antenna configuration used. Six antenna designs are examined on five land mobile frequencies from 30 to 830 MHz. An attempt has been made to make the information even more useful by referencing the roof mounted quarter-wave antennas to half-wave dipoles at the same height."
"A field test program to compare mobile radio performance in the 900 MHz and 450 MHz bands has been carried out in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, urban and suburban area. Details of the equipment used, methods of measurement with preliminary results and conclusions are given."
"This paper begins with a discussion of multipath interference. The spatial description of the field impinging upon a mobile radio antenna is derived and the power spectrum and other properties of the signal envelope are considered. Next, large scale variations of the average signal are discussed. Measurements of observed attenuation on mobile paths over both smooth and irregular terrain are summarized. The paper concludes with a discussion of methods of predicting the area of coverage from a base station."
"Building penetration loss was measured at 937 MHz in an urban environment using a new method which unlike previous methods takes into account many of the variables present in an actual portable radio system. A 900 MHz portable transceiver was used to transmit a signal to a calibrated receiver connected to a 8.5 dB gain base station antenna. Measurements were made in buildings of the class 1 type (greater than 100' x 100' or higher than 4 floors). The buildings varied in age from 1 to 50 years. A comparison was made between signal strengths at the same height inside and outside the building, as well as comparing outside street level signals with signals in the building at different floor levels. Conclusions are drawn as to the effects of height above street level, type of building construction, and outside environment with respect to the base station, on building penetration loss."
 "A brief description of the zirconia exhaust gas sensor is given. The electrochemical principles of the sensor are reviewed. Starting from the Nernst equation, theoretical relations are derived which relate the galvanic potential of the sensor to the composition of the exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine. Theoretical curves of galvanic potential vs. the inlet air-fuel ratio are shown and discussed. The utility of the zirconia exhaust gas sensor is defined in applications such as closed-loop engine control systems."
"The design of Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) controls for the automobile must take into account limitations imposed by the automotive environment and by mass production. This paper outlines the fundamentals of EFI controls and provides insight into the unique problems encountered in the design of a viable system. The impact of the electrical and physical automotive environment is analyzed, and the constraints arising from volume production and cost considerations are discussed."
  "The marriage of the computer with mobile telephone systems offers a new dimension in efficiency, flexibility and automated management. The system control approach treated in this paper spans not only existing systems but also those to operate in the new radio frequency spectrum now awaiting action by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The Martin Marietta HICOM Advanced Mobile Telephone System (AMTS) is a unique, new, centralized system control design, that makes advanced mobile telephone systems available now!"
"Xerox Corporation has spent the last year and one half in the study and development of systems to solve the ever-increasing problem of efficient radio dispatching for Law Enforcement, Utilities, Fire, Ambulance, Commercial services industries and any other activities that require radio dispatching. Some of the unique features that Xerox Corporation is using to solve these problems are software and hardware modularity concepts, multi-shared system concepts, and foreground/background operation. The areas that this paper addresses are the current problems, the concerns and Xerox's solutions to these problems using computerized system concepts that are state-of-the-art and currently being put to use throughout the United States today."
"This paper describes the computer controlled \"Metro-Page\" paging terminals, the decimal digital five-tone sequential signalling method, and the \"Metro-Pageboy\" paging receiver which were developed at Motorola to meet the current Common Carrier metropolitan paging needs. These new generation system ingredients provide greater traffic and code capacity in order to extend service to about 100,000 subscribers from a single RF channel utilizing lightweight shirt pocket size VHF-FM pagers. Also described are the unique subscriber list, battery saver, \"Mem-O-Lert\" and programmable code plug features which facilitate both Common Carrier and paging subscriber operations."
"Personal radios are useless. They are useless if they must stand alone in a system which is expected to cover a large area with 100% reliability. Personal radios need not stand alone, however, due to the availability of receiver voting systems. Receiver voting systems allow people equipped with personal radios to talk back to a dispatcher from long distances since they allow receivers to be located at strategic points throughout an area. Receiver voting systems come in three basic types: relay race, tone quantized, and noise floor measuring, each of which function basically by measuring signal quality."

It directly executes software written in the SPLM Language (SPLML), which has been specially constructed as a complete, concise notation for the application area. The goal of the SPLM development effort is to design machines that are smaller, faster and easier to program than currently available aerospace computers. The specific features and characteristics of the SPLM may have general applicability, although this was not a design criterion."

"In 1965 MOBIDIC-B was acquired by the National Bureau of Standards for use in its computer research facility. It has been employed as both object and tool in numerous projects including intermachine communication, multi-programming, process control and research applications programming. During its tenure significant modifications have been made to its hardware configuration and instruction set. Its history is summarzed in Figure 1. Now that MOBIDIC-B is nearing the end of its useful life, it is fitting that we record the essential characteristics of this one-of-a-kind, but significant, machine."

"We describe in this paper an RCA Labs team project begun in 1968, with the general goal to predict the performance of new system architectures being considered within RCA for future computers. The cache-system or slave memory idea was the principal subject. However, many other problems have been studied, and the data base that was collected has been found useful in analysis as well as prediction of performance, and in obtaining fundamental data for modelling purposes."
"A cache-based computer system employs a fast, small memory -the \" cache\" - interposed between the usual processor and main memory. At any given time the cache contains as much as possible the instructions and data the processor needs; as new information is needed it is brought from main memory to cache, displacing old information. The processor tends to operate with a memory of cache speed but with main memory cost-per-bit. This configuration has analogies with other systems employing memory hierarchies, such as \"paging\" or \"virtual memory\" systems. In contrast with these latter, a cache is managed by hardware algorithms, deals with smaller blocks of data (32 bytes, for example, rather than 4096), provides a smaller ratio of memory access times (5:1 rather than 1000: 1), and, because of the last factor, holds the processor idle while blocks of data are being transferred from main memory to cache rather than switching to another task. These are important differences, and may suffice to make the cache-based system cost effective in many situations where paging is not."

"The Publications Committee of IEEE Computer Society and the Publication Board of ACM have agreed that Computing Reviews should expand its coverage to provide reviews of considerably more material (books, technical papers, symposia proceedings and the like) of prime interest to members of IEEE, particularly of its Computer Society. These will be critical evaluations as characteristic of Computing Reviews, and not abstracts. It is hoped this step will enhance the usefulness of Computing Reviews to a wider range of computer professionals. Much of the additional material will fall in the Computing Reviews category for Hardware, but the sections on Electrical and Electronic Engineering, on computer systems, real-time, telecommunications, and related categories will also grow."

 "If an unlimited number of processors is available, then for any given number of steps s, s≥1, polynomials of degree as large as C2n-δcan be evaluated, where C= √2 and δ ≈ √2s. This implies polynomials of degree can be evaluated in log2n+√2log2n +0(1) steps. Various techniques for the evaluation of polynomials in a \"reasonable number\" of \"steps\" are compared with the known lower bounds."
"Two error-correcting algorithms for redundant residue number systems are presented, one for single residue-error correction and the other for burst residue-error correction. Neither algorithm requires table lookup, and hence their implementation needs a memory space which is much smaller than that required by existing methods. Furthermore, the conditions which the moduli of the redundant residue number systems must satisfy for single residue-error correction are less restrictive than that of existing methods. Comparison of the approach on which these two algorithms are based and that of existing methods is given."
"A physicomathematical basis is used to establish bounds TD(n) on the time needed to compute n-argument functions by spatially distributed primitive devices or composite systems D. The axioms used concern the speed, packing density, and noise threshold of the energy with which any computing device detects or alters the physical representation of information. The principal result is that TD(n) grows at least as n1/2. Composite systems consisting of spatially distributed identical components are examined in light of this bound. Inherent bounds on the computing time of n-argument functions are then combined with TD(n), resulting in a measure of computational efficiency which bounds computing time to processor size."
"A method is developed for the reconstruction of a two-dimensional convex symmetric object from two orthogonal projections. To reconstruct a three-dimensional object, the object is divided into thin slices and the slices are individually reconstructed. An experimental result of the reconstruction of a clay model from its X-ray pictures is described. Applicability of this technique to cardiac cineangiography is discussed."
"A fast algorithm for eliminating hidden linies from perspective representations of single-valued functions of two variables is presented. Compared with the most widely used algorithm for this problem, the algorithm presented here is as versatile, but much faster. Compared with a recently published algorithm for this problem, the algorithm presented here is more powerful and as fast. Compared with more general algorithms, the one presented here is much less complicated, since this algorithm is tailored to this problem."
"The computation of window operations and arbitrary local operations on a parallel organized computer is studied. It is shown that for the window operations, the computation time can be minimized, subject to the restriction of memory accessibility. It is also shown that the computation time increases as the degree of disorderliness of a local operation increases."
"DRO associative memory, as well as NDRO associative memory, is used for realizing an arbitrary stored interconnection address system and the increment store of a parallel-type DDA. An MFMU is used also for realizing a parallel-type DDA with an arbitary stored interconnection system. In this system each memory cell represents an integrator with its address codes."
"With the increasing complexity of logic that can be fabricated on a single large-scale integrated (LSI) circuit chip, there is a growing problem of checking the logical behavior of the chips at manufacture. The problem is particularly acute for sequential circuits, where there are difficulties in setting and checking the state of the system."
"A nonlinear filtering problem is investigated, and the discrete representation theorem is used to synthesize the optimal filter. An optimal filtering algorithm is described, and hybrid techniques are employed to effect several methods of implementing the algorithm on a hybrid computer. These implementations are then compared (via Monte Carlo analysis) on the bases of speed and accuracy. It is concluded that hybrid computation techniques can be used to advantage when studying proposed nonlinear optimal estimation formulations."
"The primary problem dealt with in this paper is the following. Given some description of a visual object, find that object in an actual photograph. Part of the solution to this problem is the specification of a descriptive scheme, and a metric on which to base the decision of \"goodness\" of matching or detection."
"The efficient partitioning of a finite-dimensional space by a decision tree, each node of which corresponds to a comparison involving a single variable, is a problem occurring in pattern classification, piecewise-constant approximation, and in the efficient programming of decision trees. A two-stage algorithm is proposed. The first stage obtains a sufficient partition suboptimally, either by methods suggested in the paper or developed elsewhere; the second stage optimizes the results of the first stage through a dynamic programming approach. In pattern classification, the resulting decision rule yields the minimum average number of calculations to reach a decision. In approximation, arbitrary accuracy for a finite number of unique samples is possible. In programming decision trees, the expected number of computations to reach a decision is minimized."
"In this paper the Ashenhurst-Curtis theory of complex disjunctive decompositions is extended to the realm of incompletely specified Boolean functions. A compatibility relation on the column vectors of the decomposition chart is introduced, which is applied to identify all possible simple disjunctive decompositions for each input partition. The assignments of the DON'T CARE (φ) conditions that are required to realize these simple decompositions are described by a vector listing the constraints on these φ's by new Boolean variables caled constrained DON'T CAREs. A compatibility relation is introduced on these vectors, caled constrained Boolean vectors, which is applied to form complete decompositions. A Complete decomposition is one for which al possible simple decompositions have been combined into a complex decomposition. Throughout the procedure, the freedom of choice implied by the φ's is maintained as far as is alllowed by the choices that have been made to achieve the decompositions."
 "Although the conversion from octal to binary is a trivially simple process, it is still somewhat trying to have to mentally perform the conversion when reading a long list of octal numbers. The problem becomes especially annoying when one is examining the memory dump of the word contents of a machine which has a byte size not divisible by three (e.g., PDP-11). In such cases some of the octal digits contain portions of neighboring bytes. For example, in the octal representation of a 16-bit word made up of two 8-bit bytes the third digit from the right contains two bits of the right-hand byte and one bit of the left-hand byte. Unless one is very experienced in mental conversions it is very difficult to know the contents of the bytes without actually writin, down the binary representation."

"This paper derives a set of new algorithms based on the exchange method for the computation of matrix inverses including nonsingular, symmetric nonsingular, and rectangular matrices. The symmetric matrix inversion algorithm can save up to 50 percent of the computation time required for the Gauss-Jordan elimination method. The pseudoinverse algorithms derived here are very attractive in terms of small storage requirement, short computation time, and high numerical accuracy. Comparisons are made between the new algorithms and existing ones, and numerical examples are included."
"Critical races can be avoided in the binary encoding of asynchronous sequential machines by making use of general codes employing-multistep changes in secondary variables to accomplish transitions between states. The shortest length code of this type presently available is Huffman's internmeshed row set code, which encodes race-free any 2SO-row flow table with 2So-1 bits. In this paper, a new class of codes called augmented parity check codes (APC codes) is introduced and proposed for race-free encoding. Some of the properties of these codes suggest that minimum codes may require only on the order of So+ log2SObits."
"In this paper, one-output n-input combinatorial nondegenerate networks of cells are analyzed. The networks consist of one-output two-input cells that are universal in that they realize all 16 functions of the two-input variables. Such networks have a number of interesting properties, among which is the fact that if network N realizes F(x), it also realizes the dual function Fd(x)."
"A universal logic module (ULM) with interconnected external terminals contains m input terminals and s auxiliary function terminals. The module implements the function U( Z1, Z2,...,Zm) such that every Boolean function of n variables f( x1, x2,* .* * X,n) can be realized by an appropriate substitution of an element of 5= { xl,x1,x2,x2,...,Xn,xn,g1,g2,..., gs} for each zj. An improved lower bound on the minimum number of terminals of a ULM of this type is derived. It is shown that certain of the \" best-known\" designs are in fact optimal. Improved designs are presented for ULM's of nine and ten arguments."
"In this paper, we are concerned with the problem of generating minimal fault-detection experiments for fanout-free combinational logic networks. We establish the greatest lower bound on the necessary number of fault-detecting tests and show in a systematic way how such experiments can be obtained."
"This paper is concerned with the use of \"intrinsic dimensionality\" in the representation of multivariate data sets that lie on nonlinear surfaces. The term intrinsic refers to the small, local-region dimensionality ( mI) of the surface and is a measure of the number of parameters or factors that govern a data generating process. The number mI is usually much lower than the dimensionality that is given by the standard Karhunen-Loève expansion. Representation of the data is accomplished by transforming the data to a linear space of mI dimensions using a new noniterative mapping procedure. This mapping gives a significant reduction in dimensionality and preserves the geometric data structure to a large degree. Single-and two-surface data sets are considered. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate both techniques."
"A new realization scheme is proposed for implementing sequential machines with nontrivial periods. The scheme is primarily based on state assignments related to cyclic partitions on internal states of a sequential machine. Operational linkages of cyclic partitions to the input-independent autonomous clocks of sequential machines are established. Special logic design and IC implementation advantages of the scheme are demonstrated in terms of input and/or state dependencies, logic complexities, and memory requirements of sequential machines."
"This paper is concerned with the problem of realizing an arbitrary syndconous or asynchronous sequential machine using only monotone AMR (or decreasing) switching functions. It has been found that h ion always exist, that in the asynchronous case only nomal fundamental mode flow tables are considered. Univesl state assignmments resulting in monotone inceasing (or next-state funtions are characterized using the concept of an (i,j) completely separating system."
"This paper considers the problem of realizing synchronous sequential machines with shift registers. The problem is approached in two steps."
"A circulating shift register is an n-stage binary shift register with feedback from stage n to stage 1. We refer to the state cycles of the circulating shift register as natural cycles. Two natural cycles are adjacent if there is a state in the first natural cycle that differs from a state in the second only in the first digit. Double adjacencies between natural cycles occur quite frequently. A necessary and sufficient condition for their existence is developed. A contained cycle arises when both transition possibilities between two doubly adjacent natural cycles are exploited. A formula for the length of contained cycles is given, and an algorithm for finding contained cycles of prespecified length is developed. Reversible natural cycles are cycles that contain, for any n-tuple, also the same n-tuple written backwards (allowing for a cyclical shift). It is shown how double adjacencies are related to reversibility. It is also shown that double adjacencies come in strings that may be of two types, either connecting reversible or connecting nonreversible natural cycles."
"This correspondence is concerned with the study of static hazards in combinational systems by means of ( n, k, i) trees and digraphs [1],[2]."
"For the Hadamard matrix, a modified factorization procedure is developed that is likely as economical in storage requirements and in the number of computational operations as the conventional fast Hadamard transform. Using this specific factoring method, the procedure for obtaining the fast Hadamard transform may be interpreted as operations on an H diagram. The H diagram was originally derived by Marihugh and Anderson [1] to provide a graphical representation for logic functions."
"In this correspondence a brief discussion of some structural aspects of a class of linear product feedback shift-register sequences (fsrs) is given. The particular class concerns sequences with a characteristics polynomial that is the product of two relatively prime factors. The autocorrelation function of this class of sequences is evaluated. The results should prove useful to various applications of these sequence, as digital communication, pseudorandom sequences generators, etc."
"A method for analytically studying the two feedback shift-register pseudorandom sources is presented. It is proved, that contrary to the experimental results that have been reported by various authors, their autocorrelation function is a many-valued function. As a result, some care should be exercised in using these sources, and simulation results that have been obtained with these generators might be appropriately reconsidered."

 "The analog solution of nonlinear two-point boundary-value problems by the noniterative continuation method is described. It is shown that a two-point boundary-value problem can be reformulated as a rather complicated initial-value problem. The solution of this latter problem is demonstrated for a simple example, on a modern analog computer with fast repetitive mode. A special emphasis is put on the comparison between continuation and iteration methods."
"This paper describes a general systematic procedure for the convolution of functions that are piecewise polynomial. The procedure can be implemented by hand using a simple table format or programmed for execution on a digital computer. An algebraic convolution law is dermed to replace integration; this provides an efficient digital computation algorithm. Thus, convolution operations of any complexity can be transformed into the algebraic manipulation of numbers by a digital computer."
"A horizontally structured microprogrammable processor (AMP) designed as a tool for microcontrol, language, and processor design research, is described. The machine employs a minimally encoded microcontrol word, a very general multiple bus structure, highspeed local storage, several arithmetic/logic units, and completely asynchronous memory referencing. These features combine to yield substantial low-evel parallelism and a highly versatile microinstruction. In addition, hardware modification is easily accomplished, further supporting the experimental nature of the processor."
"With the developments of parallel computer systems, the techniques for the recognition and representation of parallel task streams in a job (program) have become important to enhance the system performance."
"This paper investigates some of the problems that arise when several microprocessors share a common control memory and a common main memory. The performance with respect to both control and main memory accessing conflicts is measured for several system configurations by means of a simulation program. The program tests a set of Digital Scientific Meta 4's operating in IBM 1130 emulation mode."
"Fault folding is the process of applying test equivalent or test implied relations from a primary output towards the connected primary inputs in order to find a reduced set of faults that cover the set of faults on the intervening network."
"The problem of designing fault detecting test sets from the functional description rather than the structural description of the networks realizing the logic function is studied. The concept of an expanded truth table for logic functions is introduced. It is proved that the set of minimal true vertices and maximal false vertices of the expanded truth table constitutes a test set to detect any number of stuck-at-faults in a network belonging to a class of restricted networks, called unate gate networks. It is further indicated that even in the presence of redundancies in the network, the test sets given remain valid."
"Multiple-input circuits that count the number of their inputs that are in a given state (normally logic ONE) are called parallel counters. In this paper three separate types of counters are described, analyzed, and compared. The first counter consists of a network of full adders. The second counter uses a combination of full adders and fast adders (that may be realized with READ-ONLY memories), while the third type of counter uses quasi-digital (i.e., analog current summing) techniques to generate an analog signal proportional to the count which is then digitized."
"A nonparametric clustering technique incorporating the concept of similarity based on the sharing of near neighbors is presented. In addition to being an essentially paraliel approach, the computational elegance of the method is such that the scheme is applicable to a wide class of practical problems involving large sample size and high dimensionality. No attempt is made to show how a priori problem knowledge can be introduced into the procedure."
"A load-and-go resident assembler using approximately 2500 words in a 16-b computer is described. It was designed for writing system programs, and assembles sufficiently fast so that there is little incentive to keep programs in object form. The assembler is table driven and can be adapted to various computers relatively easily."
"This correspondence is concerned with the use of inertial delay elements for the correction of influences of aith-order hazards and races among internal signals on the activity of asynchronous sequential circuits."
"Generation of test patterns and diagnostics for complex digital modules often involves a ternary (0, 1, u) simulation program. A non-Boolean technique, presented herein, initializes u (unknown) values in such a way that diagnostic resolution and accuracy is enhanced. A pure ternary simulator lacks this initialization capability."

"An algorithm for high-speed, two's complement, m-bit by n-bit parallel array multiplication is described. The two's complement multiplication is converted to an equivalent parallel array addition problem in which each partial product bit is the AND of a multiplier bit and a multiplicand bit, and the signs of all the partial product bits are positive."
"Cellular switching theory gives rise to the problems of counting the number of equivalence classes of m X n matrices of zeros and ones under: 1) row and column permutations; and 2) row and column permutations together with column complementations. A number of techniques are given for the solution of these problems."
"Generation of curves using incremental steps along fixed coordinate axes is important in such diverse areas as computer displays, digital plotters, and numerical control. Direct implementation of a nonparametric representation of a curve, f(x, y) = 0, has been shown to be attractive for digital generation. The algorithm in this paper is developed directly from the nonparametric representation of the curve, allows steps to be taken to any point adjacent to the current one, and uses decision variables closely related to an error criterion. Consequently, the algorithm is more general and produces curves closer to the actual curve than do previously reported algorithms."
"It has been shown that the number of tests required to detect all faults in a one-dimensional unilateral combinational iterative array consisting of p cells will, in general, be proportional to p. In this paper we consider properties of such systems that enable them to be tested with a fixed constant number of tests independent of p, the number of cells in the system. Such systems are referred to as C-testable. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the basic cell state table are derived for an iterative system to be C-testable. It is shown that an arbitrary N-state cell table can be augmented by the addition of, at most, one row and less than [log2 N]2 columns (for N ≥ 2) so as to be C-testable."
"An algorithm for the optimal solution of consistent and inconsistent linear inequalities is presented, where the optimality criterion is the maximization of the number of satisfied constraints. The algorithm is developed as a nonenumerative search procedure based on two new theorems established in this paper. It is shown that the number of iterative steps before termination is strictly less than that required by an exhaustive search. Experimental results with various types of data establish the computational tractability of the procedure under nontrivial conditions."
"A parallel picture processing machine (PPM) is presented. The proposed machine can perform local operations of both logical and arithmetical character on three by three neighborhoods of digitized pictures. It is essentially a two-dimensional machine but in a restricted sense it can be regarded as three-dimensional. The instruction repertoire is thoroughly discussed and several program examples are presented. In thelast section the implementation of the machine is described and v various tradeoffs between speed and economy are discussed. A dynamically programmable microprogram store is shown to give great freedom in program design."
"An approach of representing patterns by trees rather than by strings is described. A review of tree systems that include tree grammars, transformations, and mappings on trees and tree automata is briefly presented. The tree system is then applied to the problem of syntactic pattern recognition. Tree grammars are used for pattern description, and tree automata are used for classification. Illustrative examples include the application of the tree system to the classification of bubble chamber events and some English characters."
"The problem of reducing the number of states in an arbitrary incompletely specified deterministic finite-state machine to k states (for a given k) has proven intractible to solution within \"reasonable\" time; most techniques seem to require exponential time. Two reduction techniques–state assignment to the DON'T CARE entries, and so-called \"state splitting\"–are investigated. For both of the techniques, the question, \"Can I achieve an equivalent k state machine?\" is shown to be polynomial complete, with the resulting conjecture that neither is solvable in time bounded by a polynomial function of the size of the machine."
"A synthesis method for multiple-input change asynchronous sequential machines is proposed. The method is based on the self-synchronization principle. The internal states are realized with edge-sensitive flip-flops which are triggered selectively. The new concept of selective triggering or controlled excitation results in considerable saving in logic and more flexible design. The state assignment is arbitrary, and the number of state variables required can be made absolutely minimum. A detailed comparison of the speed of operation is made with one of the well-known methods of realization. It is found that our realization is, in general, as fast, and sometimes could be even faster."
"A new method based on a closure partition over a set of some compatibles is proposed for selecting a minimal machine from mutualy independent closure aggregates by simply checking only the trivial covering condition. The closure aggregates are derived from some closure related classes. The latter classes are derived from the closure classes by replacing aU superseded elements with their greatest superseding ones. The compatibles to be considered are some subsets of maximum compatibles related under the state transition or the set inclusion. Closure dependent classes may contain superseded and redundant compatibles but their corresponding closure aggregates have only unsuperseded and irredundant elements. Both of them are closed. However, some closure related class may not be closed and may contain some redundant elements. The remaining unrelated subsets of maximum compatibles are ignored. Superseded or redundant compatibles when they are so determined are also ignored. Thus possible candidates for irredundant closed covers can be yielded and then partitioned under the closure dependence relation."
"A synchronous sequential machine realizable in the form of a loop-free circuit of trigger flip-flops and combinational gates is called a trigger machine. This paper studies the properties of this class of machines. Most importantly, canonical circuit forms and canonical algebraic representations are presented. Other basic properties of trigger machines, many of which closely parallel those of definite machines, are also presented. It is shown that the class of trigger machines forms a Boolean algebra and that, unlike definite machines, they are closed under reversal."
"Boundary points of a threshold function fare those vertices of the n-cube that produce a minimal irredundant set of inequalities for the realization of f. In this paper they are shown to be those vertices that can be contained in separating hyperplanes. With this theorem it is shown that knowledge of canonical boundary points of self-dual canonical threshold functions allows complete determination of boundary points of equivalent functions. This provides a compact and geometrically interesting characterization of threshold functions."

 "This correspondence considers the cost and performance factors in computer architecture and how they apply to parallel processors."
"In the above-mentioned review1of Sayers' book2I commented favorably n Chapters 6-9 and the Appendixes but found the first 5 chapters unsatisfactory. I have since learned that Chapters 6-9 and the Appendixes are essentially word for word copies of two reports prepared for the Air Force by the Comtre Corporation. In the preface to Operating Systems Survey there is indeed an acknowledgment of the role of these Comtre studies as a basis for the book. However, there is nowhere an acknowledgment of the actual authors of these two reports."
"The Comtre Corporation expended development funds that led to the award of several Air Force contracts. In turn, the Corporation hired technical employees to deliver reports against a specific statement of work to the Air Force. The technical people involved were paid a salary by the Corporation to work on these particular contracts. No individual was hired as an author for what was to become the publication in question. The Corporation itself expended additional funds to bring about the completed Operating Systems Survey2publication. C. S. McIntosh, K. P. Choate, and W. C. Mittewede did not contribute any works that led to the preparation of the final manuscript for the publication."

"The problem of adding k n-bit numbers, where k ≥ 3 is considered. A novel scheme for adding such k numbers is described. Applying the bit-partitioning technique so that each partition contains m bits of each of these k numbers, where m=[log2(k-1)] is an integer ≥ log2(k-1), the final sum can be obtained in m+1 addition cycles."
"Algorithms are described for the basic arithmetic operations and square rooting in a negative base. A new operation called polarization that reverses the sign of a number facilitates subtraction, using addition. Some special features of the negative-base arithmetic are also mentioned."
"Described here is a deterministic division algorithm in a negative-base number system; here, the divisor is mapped into a suitable range by premultiplication, so that the choice of the quotient digit is deterministic."
"A core-refreshed video display system that can display gray-scale images of 32 intensity levels on a standard monochrome video monitor will be described. The system can also display flicker-free black and white images of more than 800 000 picture elements. There are special features that allow overlaying black and white images on 16-level gray-scale images and manual cursor control via an X-Y tablet. Multiple reduced size images can be accommodated by features that allow independent manipulation of images in separate areas on the display screen. This permits simultaneous display of images before and after processing."
"In the residue number system, the arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication are executed in the same period of time without the need for interpositional carry. There is a hope for high-speed operation if residue arithmetic is used for digital computation. The division process, which is one of the difficulties of this operation, is developed in the symmetric residue number system. The method described here is iterative in nature and requires the availability of two tables of the symmetric residue representations of a certain kind of integer. An algorithm for general division is derived, and the way of choosing the entries which are used to find a quotient is discussed."
"This paper presents an approach to achieve high central processing unit (CPU) availability with an increase in performance by multiprocessing on an instruction stream level, where instruction fetching/executing is done by closely coupled processing units (PU's). A treatment is given of the necessary control for coordination of the PU's. This processing interaction is accomplished by microcode shared by the units. Either PU can be interchanged in any processing function, and the total processing complex comprises a single CPU as far as the external world (i. e., the operating system and user's programs) is concerned. The results of manual simulation on two sample problems are given along with a comparison of processing with a single PU and with another instruction stream multiprocessing scheme presented in [4]."
"The design and performance evaluation of a multiprocessor system are described. The system consists of processing units sharing the processing of the same instruction stream, where tasks consist of individual instructions. The multiprocessing aspect is completely transparent to the user. The system configuration developed calls for two microprogrammed processing units sharing the same local and control stores."
"A ferroelectric memory array is described that may be implemented with discrete bits, discrete words, or multiple word components. Binary information is stored as either a positive or negative polarization state in the ferroelectric ceramic material and is read out, with interrogation, by sensing a positive polarity pulse for a \" 1\" bit, and the lack of a signal for a \" 0.\" The maximum size of the memory is limited only by noise isolation of the bit lines. The array, because of its nonresonant operation, may be interrogated asynchronously. The memory READ/WRITE circuit configuration provides random word access, a device immune to disturb pulses, and compatibility with integrated or discrete circuits. The ceramic material and its configuration provide nonvolatile storage and non-destructive readout. Experimental 5-wordX8-bit discrete word prototype memory array implementations are examined."
"In this paper we present algorithms for designing fault-detection experiments for sequential machines with special emphasis on the case in which the machine does not possess a distinguishing sequence. The length of an experiment is reduced through: 1) identifying each state with its own unique input/output set rather than using a common set for all states; 2) utilizing overlapping of the required input/output sequences so that a portion of the experiment serves more than one purpose; and 3) verifying the reference condition in which the machine is placed at many points in the experiment by as short a locating sequence as possible. Important distinctions are made between locating sequences of the type introduced in previous work and those defined and used here."
"The reliability of digital computing systems is a significant problem. A scheme using multiply redundant computing devices with a majority voting device to determine the output has been shown to improve the reliability of that output. In this paper, a devices called a dissent detector is suggested as an addition to the system. The function of this device is that of an alarm to indicate the quality of the information (likelihood that the information is correct). Dissent is defined as a family of logic functions that compare the outputs of the voters to the output of the majority gate and report the disagreement or degree of disagreement that takes place. The operation of a dissent-detector that reports any disagreement in a triplicated majority voting system is demonstrated by example. The example illustrates the importance of the dissent information to the conditional reliability of the output of the majority gate. The results show that, with very little additional equipment, the conditional reliability of a majority voting system can be greatly enhanced. In fact, the conditional reliability of the example system exceeds the reliability of any of the system components, including the majority gate and the dissent detector."
"An augmented iterative array for binary division (IAD), is described. It uses carry-save reduction and carry-look-ahead principles to achieve high speed. Logic cost and speed comparisons with two other design techniques are presented. An 8-bit prototype model that operates in under 500 ns has been built from commercially available high-speed MSI TTL integrated circuits to verify the feasibility of the IAD scheme."
"The cyclic distance-2 chaining of constant-weight codes has applications in A/ D conversions as well as in combinatorial problems involving the exhaustion of m-out-of-n combinations. It is shown in this paper that such a chaining can be obtained from the Gray code circuit and its transformations. Algorithms based on several theorems derived have been developed and programmed in APL."
"Recently, Tan developed a heuristic state assignment algorithm for asynchronous sequential machines. In this paper a state assignment algorithm based on Tan's is developed for synchronous sequential machines. It shares with Tan's algorithm the advantages of simplicity of execution and economy of logic elements in the resulting realizations."
"The compatibility relation occurs in many different disciplines in science and engineering. When a compatibility relation exists between pairs of elements in a set, an important problem is to derive the collection of aU those elements that form maximal compatibles. If the set of elements with the compatibility relation can be visualized as a compatibility graph of which the different nodes represent the elements of the set, the only edges of the graph being the nonoriented lines joining pairs of elements with the compatibility relation, then the problem of deriving the maximal compatibles becomes identical to the graph theory problem of finding all the maximal complete subgraphs in a symmetric graph. Recently, in connection with simplifying incompletely specified sequential machines, where a kind of compatibility relation also exists between pairs of internal states, Das and Sheng proposed a method for deriving the different maximal compatibles through finding all of the modified cut-sets of the incompatibility graph of the machine. This paper, without confining itself to only incompletely specified machines, considers the problem involving the compatibility relation in a broader perspective and suggests a new approach for finding aU the modified cut-sets of the incompatibility graph of a set having a compatibility relation between its different pairs of elements."
"An algorithm for determining whether or not an arbitrary sequential machine can be synthesized using only shift registers or up-down counters as memory elements is presented. When realization is possible, a basis for state assignment is given. State-partitioning techniques are used to this end and it is concluded that by means of a single test, it is possible to simultaneously check for realizability using either of the two module types."
"Threshold logic gates, up to now, generally have been presumed to provide a single function of the input variables. The threshold gates that have been integrated [1]-4] were naturally double-sided and provided complementary outputs or, more specifically, complemented dual outputs. This paper shows that the inphase and out-of-phase outputs can, in fact, be designed to provide grossly different functions of the input variables. Two examples of this technique have already been shown [5] and one of these, the full adder, has been demonstrated in a multiplier [6]. Now this technique is generalized, and furthermore, it is shown how each side can be subdivided to provide a number of functions simultaneously. Finally, virtual oRing of specific output points from each side will result in still more functions. The sum-resistor specification for any order function on either side is given. Practical application of these techniques are discussed, including those basic ones that have already been disclosed."
"In this paper, the concept of \"primary partition\" of Boolean functions has been introduced. A systematic method of obtaining the multithreshold realization of Boolean functions based on this new concept is presented. The problem essentially reduces to a table lookup procedure; the computational labor in finding the minimum-threshold minimum fan-in solution is substantially reduced."
"Existing techniques for finding minimum state covers of an incompletely specified sequential machine are streamlined to yield a single minimum cover with significantly less computation. The factor by which computation is reduced is directly proportional to the complexity of the machine."

"Observations are made relative to the choice of state assignments demonstrated in a recent note' on state assignment selection. Counter examples are given to indicate that the problem of selecting state assignments is not solved as the author implies."
"In this correspondence a new combinational algorithm for the covering problems is proposed and computational experiments are analyzed."
"The intent of this book is to develop and present ideas relating to the numerical solution of partial differential equations employing minimization techniques based on dynamic programming. The bulk of the material is devoted to linear-elliptic equations employing the potential equation to clarify the exposition. Familiarity with neither dynamic programming, nor partial differential equations, is assumed; however, the reader would probably be more comfortable with at least a nodding acquaintance with dynamic programming, invariant imbedding, and quasi-linearization, as well as at least some idea of the differences between elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic partial differential equations. A more essential prerequisite actually would be a measure of Bellman's zest for analysis. For those lacking the evangelical zeal, other approaches appear workable and worthwhile, as will be discussed later."

"AFTER approximately 20 years of obscurity, the field of fault-tolerant computing was revived by the formation of the IEEE Technical Committee on Fault-Tolerant Computing, by a series of articles in COMPUTER for January/ February 1971, by the 1971 International Symposium on Fault-Tolerant Computing in Pasadena, Calif., and by an IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS Special Issue on Fault-Tolerant Computing in November 1971. Interest and activity continued apace, and the 1972 International Symposium on Fault-Tolerant Computing was held in Newton, Mass. Most of the excellent papers in this second IEEE TRANSACTIONS Special Issue on Fault-Tolerant Computing were presented at that symposium. As an introduction to these papers, consideration of the ultimate goals of this discipline and the universe in which our work is being done is most appropriate."
"In general, one cannot predict the effects of possible failures on the functional characteristics of a logic network without knowlegde of the structure of that network."
"A new approach is developed for finding multiple fault detection tests under quite arbitrary fault models. Computational results are reported and discussed."
"In this paper we present a few fundamental results related to the problems of characterization and detection of intermittent faults in digital circuits, which, up to now, have been almost totally ignored. This problem is important since in many technologies intermittency is a predominant mode of failure."
"To aid the computer designer in addressing the proper reliability goals, an economic model is proposed in which any increase in cost for reliability is evaluated against the expected decrease in cost of failure. These criteria are applied in an example to optimize the memory configuration of a computer that has a five-year lifetime requirement in space. An internal figure of merit is developed that can be used by the computer designer when little specific spacecraft and mission data are available. A more general external figure of merit can be used when mission parameters are defined. This latter is useful both for the computer designer and the spacecraft systems engineer."
"Duplication is a technique frequently employed to achieve high reliability for a repairable system. Although the philosophy of duplication is that it takes two faults to place a system out of service, there are generally some critical single faults that cause a system failure. This paper considers the effect of such a set of faults on a repairable system's reliability. It is shown that even a small number of such faults may severely degrade the mean time to system failure and the expected downtime for an otherwise highly reliable system."
"In designing a self-checking processor, it is essential to recognize the types of failures that are most probable. Matching the checking techniques with the type of faults that are expected to occur should yield the best result with the least amount of hardware. The microprogram control will consist of integrated circuits: large-scale integration (LSI) for the memory and small-scale integration (SSI) for the associated control logic. Because of the density of chips on a plug-in package and the physical proximity of the devices on an integrated circuit, multiple faults within a single circuit are highly probable. The types of faults within a circuit have been analyzed and found to be of the type which would tend to affect the bits in a unidirectional manner. Also the failed bits would probably be adjacent rather than randomly dispersed throughout-the microprogram store word."
"The design of totally self-checking check circuits for m-out-of-n codes is described. Totally self-checking m-out-of-n checkers provide an error indication whenever the input is not an m-out-of-n code or whenever a fault occurs within the checker itself. Since the checker checks itself, there is no need for additional maintenance access or periodic exercise of the checker to verify its ability to detect errors. The basic structure of the checker relies on the use of majority detection circuits. Various gate level implementations for the majority detection circuits are also presented, although the self-checking capability of the checker does not depend on their particular implementation since they are exhaustively tested by code inputs. The self-testing checkers for k-out-of-2k codes are discussed in the most detail since the totally self-checking checkers for 1-out-of-n and arbitrary m-out-of-n codes are constructed by first translating the code to a k-out-of-2k code via a totally self-checking translator."
"This paper reports a study on the design and modeling of a highly reliable bubble-memory system. This system has the capability of correcting a single 16-adjacent bit-group error resulting from failures in a single basic storage module (BSM), and detecting with a probability greater than 0.99 any double errors resulting from failures in BSM's. The encoding/decoding network (memory translator) is designed to be self-checking, i.e., a single circuit failure in the translator wiH not produce an erroneous output that goes undetected. The system is able to perform reliable configuration in the event of uncorrectable BSM failures, memory translator failures, and dual-memory buffer failures; even in the presence of a single failure in the status registers controlling the configuration network. The bubble memory under study permits serial accessing of the store with 64 x 1024 bit blocks at a 100-kHz rate. The objective of this study is to develop good fault-tolerant design and analysis methods adequate for newly emerging technologies and prove the practicality by example. The reliability modeling study justifies the design philosophy adopted of employing memory data encoding and a translator to correct single group errors and detect double group errors to enhance the overall system reliability. By a proper design of the memory translator based on a new checking technique, a uniformly high percentage of multiple b-adjacent bit-group error detection is achieved through the use of a proposed code (detects 99.99695 percent of double b-adjacent bit-group errors and 99.9985 percent of triple or more b-adjacent bit-group errors)."
"The combination of N-modular redundancy (NMR) and standby sparing has resulted in a promising redundancy technique for protecting those portions of a fault-tolerant system whose continuous real-time operation is essential. This technique, known as hybrid redundancy, uses N + Sp identical modules. N of these are connected to a majority voter to form an NMR core. The remaining Sp are used as standby spares. Disagreement detectors instruct a switch to replace with a standby spare any of the N modules that disagrees with the majority consensus. Since the switch and disagreement detector, as well as the modules, must function properly for the system to perform its designed task, the overall system reliability depends on the disagreement detector, switch, and hybrid reliabilities. Hence the overall reliability is a function of switch reliability. A highly reliable, thus simple, switch is desirable. First, strategies where every spare can be switched into every voter position (totally assigned) are considered. An optimal strategy is developed where the number of states in the switch is the criterion used for optimality. Formulas for the switch state count for the various strategies are derived and the strategies compared. Next, partially assigned switching strategies, strategies where every spare need not be capable of occupying every voter position, are examined. It is shown that designs where all spares are assigned to the same t + 2 of the 2t + 1 voter positions have as good reliability as the more complex totally assigned switching strategy."
"This paper demonstrates two improvements in coding techniques that could be used for memory word coding. First, within the fixed structure of a Hamming single-error-correcting, double-error-detecting (SEC/DED) code, an improvement can be obtained in circuit cost and operational speed over more conventional code implementations. Second, the mechanics of error correction in a fault-tolerant computer may be carried out via conventional hardware means or by use of the existing system facilities, such as the combination of the microprogram unit, local store, and the arithmetic-logic unit. These improvements may be obtained by the use of Rotational Coding schemes in conjunction with a technique calied \"lookaside correction.\" This paper first shows a generalized algorithm for specifying the parity check matrix of Rotational Codes. The structure implemented by the parity check matrix in this paper is not merely encoding and decoding circuitry, but translates between Rotational Code forms and byte-parity encoded forms. The unique feature of these translators is that use of the Rotational Code permits the error correction to be performed on only a subset of the data word bits, and only if a single-error condition has been detected. The correction mechanism may be either a hardware logic circuit or firmware. The paper concludes with a comparison of the circuit requirements and correctional speed of the Hamming (72, 64) single-error-correcting, double-error-detecting code, as it normally would be implemented, and a Rotational Code translator also operating on 64 data bits and 8 check bits."
"A marriage of N-modular redundancy (NMR) and standby sparing has resulted in a promising redundancy technique for protecting those portions of a fault-tolerant system whose continuous real-time operation is essential. This technique, known as hybrid redundancy, consists of N identical modules connected to a majority voter to form an NMR core. Disagreement detectors instruct a switch to replace any of the N modules that disagree with the majority consensus by a standby spare. The switch is essential to the operation of the hybrid redundancy scheme. The system reliability is a product of the reliabilities of the switch and the hybrid redundancy scheme assuming a perfect switch. To realize the demonstrated potential of the latter a highly reliable, thus simple, switch is required. An iterative cell switch is proposed and demonstrated to save at least 25 percent, and more than 80 percent in some instances, of the complexity of a switch design presented elsewhere in the literature. The use of threshold, rather than majority, voters is considered and shown to yield a simpler design in some cases. Three techniques for decreasing the propagation delay through the iterative cell switch are presented as well as a scheme to implement retry of failed modules. Finally, five different switch designs are compared on a cost and complexity basis."
"Dynamically self-checked or fault-tolerant realizations of switching functions and sequential machines are proposed under a fault model that permits arbitrary logic faults in a single-logic module, where the modules are explicitly defined. These realizations permit considerable logic sharing, organized around an (n, m, r)-basis for decomposing switching functions. The logic sharing permits more economical realizations than can be obtained using classical parity and triple-modular redundancy schemes for obtaining logic circuits with the corresponding property."
"The error correcting properties of the redundant residue number systems (RNS) are investigated through a more natural a approach than was previously known. The necessary and sufficient condition for the correction of a given error affecting a single residue digit of any legitimate number in an RRNS is determined. The minimal redundancy allowing the correction of the whole class of the single residue digit errors is derived and an efficienit procedure for error correction is given. Moreover, it is shown that a smaller redundancy and a single redundant modulus may allow the correction of certain important subclasses of single residue digit errors, e.g., the set of errors affecting a single bit in the code. Examples are given."

"A novel technique for digital multiplication is presented that represents a considerable departure from conventional (i.e., add and shift or fully parallel) multiplication algorithms. The quasi-serial multiplier generates the bits of the product sequentially from least significant to most significant. Each bit is computed by \"counting\" the number of ones in the corresponding column of the bit-product matrix and adding the previous carrys. This single operation yields both the product bit and the carrys for the next column. The quasi-serial multiplier requires 2n of these count and add operations to determine the product of two n-bit numbers."
"Numerical optimization techniques are applied to the identification of linear, shift-invariant imaging systems in the presence of noise. The approach used is to model the available or measured image of a real known object as the planar convolution of object and system-spread function and additive noise. The spread function is derived by minimization of a spatial error criterion (least squares) and characterized using a matric formalism. The numerical realization of the algorithm is discussed in detail; the most substantial problem encountered being the calculation of a vector-generalized inverse. This problem is avoided in the special case where the object scene is taken to be decomposable."
"Analysis of the bit-level operations involved in the convolution realizing a nonrecursive digital filter leads to hardware designs of digital filters based on the operation of counting."
"Analysis of the bit-level operations involved in the convolutions realizing recursive digital filters leads to hardware designs of such filters based on the operation of counting. Various designs realizing both the canonic and \"direct\" forms are presented with particular emphasis on low-cost low-speed high-flexibility machines."
"The flexible network is a network composed of flexible logical multivalued cells that can be adjusted at will to perform any functions. The network is assumed to have a fixed-interconnection pattern and to have a fixed-input variable assignment. The following question is answered. What is the necessary and sufficient range of the flexibility of the cells' functions to obtain all the output functions the circuit could realize? Furthermore, the relation between the cells functions that realize the same output functions is derived and the number of different realizable output functions is counted."
"A short-turnaround graphical hard-copy system called Stare 2 has been designed and is in use at Bell Telephone Laboratories. It produces prints using a 1024x1436 matrix of overlapping dots on 11-by 17-in paper, at a speed of 2 to 10 prints per min. The system is connected to a large central computer (IBM System/370 Model 165), thus making pictures available within seconds of a program run. The output mechanism is a Gould Clevite 4800 electrographic printer with the stylus assembly modified to permit overlapping dots. A DEC PDP-15 computer controls the printer and also converts the data to the format required to drive the printer. Output may be produced at a location remote from the central computer since the connection to the hard-copy system is via a 2000-Bd transmission system."
"This paper considers the stability and errors associated with various combinations of hybrid simulation modes, sampling sequences, and compensating schemes."
"A system of programs is described for the detection of the straight edge lines in simple scenes. Distinct lines are detected by a procedure that is relatively inexpensive. The more subtle lines are then located by a search that is much more costly per unit area, but which is only applied to certain areas suggested by the locations of the lines already found. The considerable efficiency of this approach to edge detection is discussed both theoretically and in relation to the performance of the present system. The heuristics used in proposing possible subtle lines are described in detail. In addition, considerable attention is devoted to other aspects of the procedure such as: local edge-detection operators, vertex finding, and the extraction of lines from local evidence."
"In this paper, measures of probabilistic dependence are derived from distance measures and are applied to feature evaluation in pattern recognition. The main properties of the measures are derived and are discussed in their application to feature-class dependency. Relations between the measures and error probability are derived. Experiments using feature subsets extracted from Munson's hand-printed data are performed to compare the feature-evaluating capabilities of the measures both relative to each other and relative to error probability."
"Many digital systems have need for continuous-type output for oscilloscope display, process control, or hybrid computation. This paper presents a generalization and unification of the theory of extrapolation and reconstruction of sampled data. This generalization allows implementation of a recursive algorithm or digital filter in conjunction with the continuous data reconstruction. The general procedure is demonstrated for the implementation of an nth-order recursion relation using polynomial or exponential data reconstruction requiring only a single resetting integrator for the general nth-order reconstructor."
"This paper shows that the imposition of some restrictions on the realization of a sequential machine facilitates the derivation of efficient checking sequences for some machines. Specifically, it is assumed that the state logic or the output logic may be faulty, but both of them cannot be faulty at the same time. This condition is satisfied if there is no shared logic between the state and output logic and at most a single fault in the circuit. It is also assumed that the normal machine has a synchronizing sequence. With these restrictions on the realization, the machine identification approach may be used to derive checking sequences that are often shorter than those without the restrictions and detect a larger set of faults than with the circuit testing approach."
"A formula is found for the distribution of the number of ones in a subsequence of a maximal-length shift-register sequence. The formula relates the distribution to the binomial distribution with probability 1/2 with a difference that depends on the structure of the set of linear recurrences satisfied by the sequence. Considerations are discussed that aid in the choice of a shift register to be used in generating an approximately binomially distributed random variable."
"After a brief outline of classical concepts relative to Boolean differential calculus, a theoretical study of the main differential operators is undertaken. Algebraic equations relating the classical concepts of prime implicants and of the discrete Fourier transform of a Boolean function to the differential operators are derived. Application of these concepts to several important problems arising in switching practice is mentioned."
"Observations are shown of oscillatory and metastable behavior of flip-flops in response to logically undefined input conditions such as those that occur in synchronizers and arbiters. Significant systems failures have resulted from this fundamentally inescapable problem that is generally not appreciated by system designers and users."
"It is shown that the class of Post algebras of finite order n is equationally definable where the only unary operators are the disoint operators Ci, i = 0, 1,..., n -1."
"A repeated application of nested multiplication by ten yields an extremely simple method for binary to binary-coded decimal (BCD) conversion where the input is a binary fraction. This technique can be implemented in a cellular array or in a serial system using an adder and storage register. The cellular array is, however, a faster method and can be implemented with available circuits."
"The importance of obtaining correct circuit outputs may vary from one input to another, along a continuum of \"importance weights.\" Assigning such weights introduces a concept of degraded operation, where some relatively unimportant outputs may be in error. A simple procedure is given for assessing reliability using these weights."
"The Walsh series coefficients for the circular functions are considered. Specifically we determine the sequency content of eJπtand present bounds on the corresponding sequency-line spectrum."
"The general response of a linear sequential circuit involves a transition matrix in the form of a matrix A raised to a variable power. The power becomes arbitrarily high causing the direct computation of the transition matrix to become very cumbersome. This correspondence demonstrates that A, having finite-field elements, may be transformed into a matrix of real numbers. Known methods may then be applied to this real matrix to simplify computing a power of it. The result is then transformed back to the finite field which is the desired result However, numerical difficulties as mentioned in the conclusion prevent this method from being the final solution to the problem."
"In the January 1973 issue of this TRANSACTIONS an inadvertant oversight resulted in the omission of the photograph which should have appeared with Kiyoshi Maruyama's paper entitled \"On the Parallel Evaluation of Polynomials.\" The Editor takes this opportunity to correct the oversight, and to extend apologies to Dr. Maruyama."
"This book contains a rather complete collection of algorithms, heuristics, and techniques for use in statistical or geometrical pattern recognition problems. Included are techniques for recognition, feature selection, and general data analysis. The rationale for presenting such an extensive bag of tricks is due to the author's feeling that mathematical pattern recognition is \"...a collection of numerical algorithms for solving very particular problems posed in very particular ways.\" Because of this, the book should make an excellent reference work in mathematical pattern recognition."
"This publication is not really a book but is similar to a Joint Computer Conference proceedings devoted to a single topic. It includes an analysis section that is a transcript of a discussion between several participating experts. The result is what one would expect from a panel discussion–a somewhat rambling presentation of informed opinions but without adequate supporting justification or rationale. Nonetheless many important points are made by the participants."

"Hardware Fourier transformations are considered with the goal of increasing speed through parallel operation. Two designs in which the basic element is a fast counter are developed. One is applicable when the number of transformed points N is prime while the other, requiring somewhat more hardware, is applicable to all N."
"The problem of assigning a probability to each word of a language is considered. Two methods are discussed. One method assigns a probability to a word on the basis of particular measurable features of the language. The second method is applied to languages L(G) generated by a grammar G. A probability is associated with each production of G. These in turn define the word probabilities of each word in the language. The conditions for this assignment to be a probabilistic measure are derived."
"Any switching function may be transformed into a completely symmetric switching function with some of its variables repetitive. In this paper we shall discuss certain properties, easily detectable in decomposition charts, that may be applied to reduce the number of repeated variables when such a transformation is performed. An algorithm utilizing lookup tables based on these properties has been devised enabling us with relative ease to transform an arbitrary switching function of four variables into a completely symmetric switching function with the least number of variables. The algorithm may be generalized to n-variable switching functions provided that the corresponding lookup tables are made available."
"The previous bound on average worst case carry in a two's complement adder found by Burks et al. [1] is tightened, a bound is established for one's complement adders, and exact expressions for average worst case carry are derived and \"experimentally\" tested. It is found that an n-bit ripple-carry two's complement adder with carry-completion detection is potentially as fast, on the average, as the old bound indicated an n/√2-bit adder of the same kind would be."
"The design of a graphic display system for remote terminal application is presented. Control data requirements are reduced by generating a useful set of graphic primitives locally at the remote terminals."
"A general model of systems consisting of \"control units\" and \"passive units\" is established. These units could be instructions and data in computer programs, for example, or information processing modules and files in data management systems; other applications are also suggested. The model contains both structural and behavioral information. The sets of units of the model are partitioned, and the resulting subsets correspond to different groups of elements of real systems."
"A control method based on anticipatory shift with lookahead is proposed for accessing files stored in a cyclically permutable memory as characterized by, for example, bubble-domain devices. The performance of this method is analyzed and is shown to yield significant reduction of access time. By using a basic simple model, an explicit formula is obtained for relating performance to the size of requests, the shift register length, and the number of control sections allowed. Several generalizations are also discussed."
"This paper describes the internal workings of a low-cost microprogrammed processor designed to control electronic switching systems. The machine is structurally regular to ease maintenance difficulties and allow more efficient packaging."
"This paper describes the various fault detection, routine exercise, and diagnostic techniques used in the design of a switching complex. Unlike other electronic switching system (ESS) processors, the processor is entirely self-checking."
"With the advent of field-effect transistor (FET) technology it has become practical and economical to employ complex functions as network primitives. This paper describes a synthesis procedure for diagnosable (all single and multiple faults can be detected) FET networks. A companion procedure for generating tests to detect all faults in the resulting network is also described. This methodology does not guarantee the minimality of the network, however, it is intuitively understandable and easy to apply."
"The principle of dynamic programming is used to develop a digital computer software package for determining for each of several subsystems the optimal numerical integration algorithm from among given candidate techniques. As by-products, the corresponding optimal step sizes and error contributions of the subsystems are provided to the user. The developed program minimizes subsystem sum-squared errors subject to the constraint that the total time available for executing all subsystem integrations is specified in advance. After the basic concept of dynamic programming has been reviewed briefly, the details of the computer software package are presented. Numerical results are given for two examples, including a limited hybrid partitioning problem for a six-degree-of-freedom air-defense missile simulation. Finally, general considerations for hybrid partitioning are discussed, and extensions to the developed program are suggested."
"Recently, a good deal of research has been conducted on the use of transition-or edge-sensitive elements in the design of asynchronous sequential circuits. Transition-sensitive memory elements have been used extensively in the implementation of synchronous sequential circuits as a means of eliminating the restrictions placed on pulsewidth. Several means are available for achieving multiple-input or universal transition-sensitive flip-flops. Here the approach is to employ a basic flip-flop as the memory element and add transition-sensitive gating to the flip-flop input. In this manner, any type of transition-sensitive flip-flop may be configured."
"As computers become capable of executing more arithmetic operations simultaneously, the question of compiling for such machines becomes more important."
"Families of acceptors, called SS-AFA, are introduced in which the storage structure is of a very general form. For example, SS-AFA include ordinary AFA and all known multitape AFA, as well as families of acceptors whose storage structure is an n-dimensional array, a tree, or a linked structure. It is shown that from the point of view of languages defined, SS-AFA are equivalent to ordinary AFA."
"This correspondence outlines a theory for choosing printed circuit board dimensions in order to avoid crowding of printed wiring. Given a number of components to be mounted on the board and the dimensions of wiring, the theory predicts a minimum board size that should be easy to lay out. The theory does not tell how many components should be put on a board."
"In the above correspondence,1an algorithm has been described that allows the transposing of a 2n× 2nmatrix by reading and writing n times at the most via direct access rows of the matrix and by permuting its data elements. The generalization to arbitrary square matrices has not been described, and the generalization to nonsquare matrices has been reported to be impossible."
"Computer transposition of matrices larger than available main storage is a nontrivial problem. Undoubtedly, the solution to this problem, suggested by Schumann is tractable from a mathematical point of view. However, some comments relating to my correspondence1seem appropriate."
"Concepts of group theory are used to explain the difference between two major fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms and the relation between FFT and fast Walsh transforms."
"This is a refreshingly clear introductory text on computer organization for undergraduates with very little previous background in computers. The clarity of exposition makes it useful for self-reading. The author admirably succeeds in his stated purpose which is \"to introduce the student to the most primitive actions of a computer and then show how the primitive actions can be put together to construct most of the complex actions that computers regularly perform.\""
"The book is a general and fairly brief introduction to the structure of time-sharing computer systems and to the facilities that they provide. The authors indicate that their book is supposed to serve two purposes. It is supposed to assist in making comparisons between different systems in order to make a selection evaluation, and it should also serve as a textbook for an undergraduate course on time-sharing systems."
"This book comprises two distinct parts. The first five chapters form a standard exposition on logic design, while the remainder, which is of about the same length as the first part, deals with digital electronics. Each chapter is followed by a set of problems and references, and a lengthy bibliography is included as an Appendix."
"Problems of testing switching networks have been with us since the first computer was built and have become more difficult as the technology moved from discrete components to integrated circuits. Consequently, there has been an increasing interest in this area. This book covers methods of deriving efficient tests for different classes of switching circuits."

 "Alternative cable system designs to cover the Dayton metropolitan area are considered. This area includes the city of Dayton, 12 other incorporated cities, and unincorporated areas scattered nearby, encompassing a total population of nearly 600000. At one extreme, the paper considers the prospects of each city having its own separate system. However, in contrast to present-day 12-channel one-way cable TV systems, the more advanced two-way technology of concern here involves high fixed costs that would be out of reach of most of the cities acting alone. In other words, there are substantial economies of scale in advanced cable technology that can be satisfactorily exploited only with a large subscriber base. Only two cities in the area, Dayton and Kettering, appear large enough to exploit these economies of scale."
"The feasibility of connecting 19 outlying municipalities in the Miami Valley five-county area into a metropolitan cable network is examined. It is concluded that the use of supertrunk would permit inclusion of Tipp City, Breokvllle, and Germantown, because they lie within a mile or two of the nearest metropolitan cable distri. Carlisle also is dose, but its low populatio density makes it itable for inclusion in the forseeable future. For towns farther from the metropolitan area, the two leading possibilities are convetinal FM microwave equipment, which we assume is used within the metropolitian area as described in \"System Designs for the Dayton Metropolitan Area,\" and the use of local dis on service (LD) microwave equipment now under development."

"The concept of field-time and line-time waveform distortion (LD and LD) permits us to express in numbers the subjective quality of large details in a TV picture. The measuring methods for both FD and LD are presented together with examples of typical TV facilities. Also presented are special measuring methods for facilities that have very small FD and/or LD."

"The introduction of product (synchronous) detection into TV systems causes greater concern about incidental phase modulation of the visual carriers. When phase modulation occurs, the detected signals will be degraded for both product and envelope detection, and the degradations will be different for the two methods of demodulation."
"Deflection linearity and adjustment in a TV system are accomplished by a test pattern usually generated by a scanning process which may itself be subject to error. This paper describes a method and equipment for generating a circular test pattern derived from an electronic memory. The readout is accomplished by an accurate time base synchronous with scanning standards. By this means an extremely accurate circular (or other) pattern can be generated for adjustment of display devices."
"Huge transmission capacity will be required for informational and instructional service in the near future. To satisfy the requirement, a new broadcasting system using still pictures with sound is proposed. This paper presents the basic idea including classification of program types and characteristics of the transmission signal, especially the means of handling effectively a large number of sound signals. A pilot system developed for studying multiple transmission of programs is also described."

"Engineering studies of broadcasting-satellite utilization require the determination of such items as the coverage patterns on the surface of the earth (\"footprints\") of satellite spot beams, including the elevation and direction at which the satellite is seen, or, for interference study purposes, the determination of the antenna off-axis angle of interfering signals or, perhaps, the day and hour of solar noise increase (\"sun-transit\"). Simple formulas, based on a circular earth and geostationary orbit, provide approximate answers sufficient for the broadcast engineer. A number of such formulas in, it is believed, their simplest form, are given in the article with respect to the above subjects."

"We consider families of stochastic processes indexed by a finite number of alternative parameter values. For general classes of stochastic processes it is shown that maximum likelihood estimates converge almost surely to the correct parameter value. This is established by use of a submartingale property of the sequence of maximized likelihood ratios together with a technique first employed by Wald [3] in the case of independent identically distributed random variables."
"Kalman Filtering in the presence of white process and measurement noises of unknown means and covariances is considered. Only stationary linear discrete stochastic systems are considered. It is shown that noise covariances can be identified without knowledge of noise means. Thus, the identification of noise statistics can be divided into two sub-problems: identification of noise covariances and identification of noise means, and these two subproblems can be solved in that order. The second subproblem is considered in Part II. The procedure for identifying noise covariances is a nontrivial extension of Mehra's results to the case where the process and measurement noises are correlated; it is therefore nonrecursive in nature."
"Two new algorithms are proposed for identifying the noise means required before Kalman Filtering. These algorithms use the results of Part I of this paper, i.e., the identified noise intensities (or the optimal predictor gain if the noise intensities cannot be identified). To be Compatible with the algorithms of Part I, the algorithms described here are also nonrecursive. They are based on the maximum-likelihood approach. The cost function resulting from this approach is considerably simplified before deriving the algorithms, which affords a great insight into the problem at hand. The question of uniqueness of bias estimates is considered in the light of the invertibility of dynamic systems. An example is included to partially illustrate the algorithms. A significant advantage of our approach is the ability of suboptimally identifying the noise means even when the noise intensities cannot be uniquely determined."
"This paper is a survey of a study implemented during the last two years, considering the correction (unfolding) of smearing effects due to instrumental resolution in physical experiments (neutron - and X-ray scattering). In order to obtain as well on-line as interactive situations of treatment of data, sequential methods were studied. Two classes of problems have been treated. In the first one no a-priori physical knowledge about the functions to be estimated was available and simple staircase functions or spline models were developed, so that the application of the Kalman-Bucy Filter equations was advisable. In the second class, analytical functions were given so that the parameters of nonlinear models were to be estimated. This has been done applying the extended Kalman filter equations. Several practical examples have been discussed."
"Data filtering with presmoothed measurements is a useful technique for data compression in high data rate, noisy measurement systems. A sequential filtering algorithm is derived for processing integrated measurements, and the algorithm is applied to data filtering with discrete presmoothed measurements. Prefilter trade studies with a two dimension system show that the algorithm may provide a large reduction in filter computations with only a small increase in RMS error."
"This paper considers the estimation problem for linear continuous-time systems with the interrupted observation mechanism which is characterized in terms of the jump Markov process taking on the values of 0 or 1. The minimum variance estimator algorithm is derived. The approach adopted here is that we express the jump process in terms of the initial value and the jump times instead of its instantaneous values and that in order to apply Lainiotis' formula we regard the initial value and jump times as the unknown system parameter vector. The parameter vector is, however, infinite dimensional so that Lainiotis' formula cannot be applied directly. This is because the formula is applicable only to linear systems with a finite dimensional parameter vector. Therefore, the minimum variance estimator algorithm is derived by using some limiting procedure. The resultant optimal algorithm is infinite dimensional, so that feasible approximate algorithms should be developed for practical implementation. A simple illustrating example is also worked out."
"This paper reports on the basic structure of the Urban Institute Housing Model, a model of 10-year changes in housing quality and household location within a metropolitan area. The model represents a metropolitan area housing market by a few dozen \"model\" households and dwellings (each one representing several hundred or thousand actual cases), a building industry, and a composite \"government.\" Households seek to maximize \"utility\", owners of dwellings to maximize profits. A simulation algorithm is used to find a solution to the model for any set of inputs. Differences in quality among dwellings and differences in racial composition and wealth among geographic zones all play major roles in the model. The model can incorporate a wide range of government policies with respect to housing and land use."
"This paper deals with the various classes of controls according to information patterns. The classification is made according to the utilization of past measurements and the available information about future measurements. It is shown how the utilization of the future measurement program and the associated statistics distinguishes the stochastic closed-loop class from the stochastic feedback class. The notions of probing, caution and dual effect are discussed in detail."
"A jump process is best analyzed by investigating the space of all martingales which are generated by the process. The structure of this space of martingales becomes clear in the martingale representation results. Having understood this structure one can completely resolve the most important problems in i) modelling and description, ii) detection or hypothesis testing and iii) filtering of jump processes. The discussion here is not the most general possible, but it covers all the important practical situations."
 "A prefiltering version of the Kalman filter is derived for both discrete and continuous measurements. The derivation consists of determining a single discrete measurement that is equivalent to either a time segment of continuous measurements or a set of discrete measurements. This prefiltering version of the Kalman filter easily handles numerical problems associated with rapid transients and ill-conditioned Riccati matrices. Therefore, the derived technique for extrapolating the Riccati matrix from one time to the next constitutes a new set of integration formulas which alleviate ill-conditioning problems associated with continuous Riccati equations. The prefilter extends Potter's square root filtering, with all its advantages, to continuous measurement problems. Prior to this work, no technique existed for numerically integrating the general ill-conditioned, time-varying and continuous Riccati equation."
"We investigate a stochastic penalty algorithm, which can be used to find a constrained optimum point for a concave or convex objective function subject to a nonlinear constraint which forms a connected region, even when we do not have the objective function available, but only have a noisy estimate of the objective function. When the constraint consists of one linear equation, we prove convergence to the constrained optimum value and bound the rate of convergence of the algorithm to the constrained optimum value. We then apply this algorithm to the nonlinear problem of automatically making an array of detectors form a beam in a desired direction in space when unknown interfering noise is present so as to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio subject to a constraint on the super-gain ratio."
"A segmented algorithm for solving state constrained optimal control problems is presented. Its main feature is that it may be implemented on an array of digital computers. Such an implementation exhibits two attractive properties. The first one is that the computational time is reduced due to the parallelism of computations achieved. The second property is that a graceful degradation of performance is realized, i.e., the array produces approximate solutions in the presence of hardware faults."
"This paper presents a new function minimization algorithm for minimizing nonlinear functions of a finite number of variables subject to nonlinear equality constraints. The algorithm also provides for the explicit handling of upper and lower bounds on each of the independent variables. Although other more general inequality constraint can be transformed into an equality constraint at the expense of introducing an additional slack variable. The algorithm proposed combines the idea of a \"balance function,\" developed independently in References 1 and 2 with a second order method for updating the balance function La grange multipliers originally developed in Reference 3. This updating technique makes use of the current estimate of the inverse Hessian of the balance function which is a byproduct of the unconstrained minimization of the balance function using the Fletcher-Powell algorithm."
"The problem of optimal control of a nonlinear system with non quadratic final cost function admits a closed-loop suboptimal solution by approximation of the Lyapounov function by means of the control-equivalent Gaussian sum method. Using the duality between optimal control for deterministic systems and estimation for stochastic systems, the solution is presented as the superposition of solutions of linear subsystems."
"This paper describes different types of patterning which exist in such diverse types of data as speech, text, and pictorial scenes. Several programs which process such data are discussed in terms of contextual, syntactic, semantic, and problem-domain dependent factors. Each of these factors constitutes a potential level of computer processing. By introducing different processing levels each having certain special characteristics (success on some data, inability to resolve other data) we isolate a general technique for producing a level adaptive program system."
"When a computer system is handling its workload in a multiprogramming environment, it has to control a concurrent execution of a number of user programs or processes. These processes make use of various hardware and software resources of the system, some of which are capable of autonomous, parallel operation. The computer system sources while allowing a systematic execution of user jobs via its Operating System."
"An adaptive probability state variable (PSV) parameter search algorithm Possessing long-term memory has been formulated to cope with systems that must avoid high performance-penalty operating regions. The information gained from all previous experiments is efficiently encoded in multivariate probability distribution functions (pdf's). This long-term memory capability enables the PSV algorithm effectively to avoid future experiments in high penalty regions. The systems considered are resource-limited, and catastrophic failure may occur if parameter values lying in high penalty regions are implemented. Those cases in which the high penalty regions are not known in advance were investigated. The PSV algorithm has the capability of adaptively learning the location and hypervolume of these regions as the search proceeds. The algorithm is explicitly guided in its internal strategies as a function of the remaining system resources and the updated probability distribution functions. Clustering analysis is used both in the discovery of new operating regions and for updating the pdf's, As a by-product of this research, clustering was also investigated as a presearch scheme. It is shown that this procedure has great promise as a means of assessing the complexity of an optimization problem. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the utility of the adaptive PSV search algorithm."
"An airborne digital computer is used to estimate gun misalignment, ballistic wind and wind at altitude. The navigator interacts with the computer in making decisions as to whether observed data is reliable and whether certain parameters in the computer should be changed. The use of this system still retains human judgment while at the same time gives the navigator the power of digital computation."
"The problem of constructing an \"observer\" to enable us to implement an approximate optimal control for a distributed parameter system is examined where the state is measured at a few pre-specified points. The observer is formulated as the output of a dynamical system described by a set of ordinary differential equations. Both distributed and boundary control problems are studied and the observer-formulation is set up for both cases. Some reasonable assumptions have been made in order that the approximation introduced by the eigenfunction expansion technique be satisfactory. For the case of the boundary control problem, a simple example is solved to illustrate the method."
"A method is presented for generating the optimal control of a linear system from measurements of the system input and output. The systems considered are n-th order, time invariant or time varying forced linear systems which are restricted to be bounded and uniformly completely state reconstructible. The control is generated from an estimate of the state vector which is obtained from an observer. The observer dynamics are derived from an optimal estimation formulation which is closely related to the concept of observability. Asymptotic stability of the observer is demonstrated and the effects of initial errors are considered. The result is a practical method of estimating the state of a linear system from noiseless measurements of the input and output. Additionally, theoretical results are obtained concerning the existence of observers for time varying linear systems."
"This paper introduces finite-time observers for a class of non-linear dynamic systems. The concept of observability is first shown to be a necessary condition for the existence of a finite-time observer for the system. Then a finite-time observer for an important class of systems is constructed with a novel structure which avoids the use of differentiators."
"Observer theory for constant-coefficient, linear systems is extended to systems with unknown, inaccessible inputs. Two types of observers for such systems are defined, and simplified criteria for their existence are developed. A theorem regarding the structure of these observers is given which allows the application of results for systems with single unknown inputs to systems with multiple unknown inputs."
"This paper discusses a well known change of co-ordinates for multiple output systems from a different viewpoint, and a new, simplified, low order observer design. The discussion of the transformation given here exhibits more of the system structure than previous presentations. The observer design procedure does not require explicitly performing a change of basis on the system, and includes the construction of the linear transformation relating the system state to the asymptotic observer state."
"In many applications, computer requirements and sensitivity to modeling errors can be reduced by using an estimator of much lower order than the system. The techniques discussed here produce reduced-order estimators which minimize the variance of the estimation error. These minimum-variance reduced-order estimators provide systematic guidelines for designing reduced-order estimators and quantitative criteria for evaluating the performance of heuristically designed estimators."
"Several techniques for designing observer systems to estimate full state feedback control laws for linear systems are discussed. Specifically, a solution to the problem of determining a feedback control law (for high order systems) in situations when all the states are not available for measurement is obtained through an application of observer theory. The basic approach for designing observer systems is discussed and the application of the design techniques to a number of test systems is outlined."
"A signal detection problem for continuous rotational processes is formulated by using H. P. McKean's trick of \"injection.\" Both the sensor and the signal dynamics are described by bilinear 3 × 3-matrix Ito differential equations, where noise can be viewed as entering multiplicatively. The injection is shown to be bijective. This facilitates the derivation of a likelihood ratio formula in terms of updated observation. The least-squares estimation required in the formula can be solved analogously. These results are then applied to signal detection from frequency-modulated carriers. In particular, the likelihood ratio for the frequency-shift-keyed binary communication is evaluated."
"This paper describes an eigenvector decomposition of an m × n rectangular matrix, P0. Matrix P0 is approximated as a series of matrices each one of which can be expressed as the outer product of two vectors. These vectors are of dimensions m × 1 and n × 1; thus, each term in the approximation to P0 requires m + n storage locations. If P0 is approximated by a series of l matrices, then l(m + n) storage locations are required to store the approximation. Data compression will be achieved by this approximation for those values of l for which l(m + n) < mn."
"Let the given covariance stationary process y(.) obey a linear stochastic difference equation made up of y(k) and its n1 lagged values, the observable input u(k) and Its n3 lagged values, the unobservable input w(k) derived from a zero mean white noise sequence, and n2 deterministic sinusoidal trend terms ϕj(k), J=1,...,n2, the coefficients of all the terms being unknown. Our intention is to identify those terms in the difference equation whose coefficients are identically equal to zero on the basis of the observations y(k), u(k), k=1,...,N. This problem is equivalent to the following multiple hypothesis testing problem, i.e., determine the correct model among a finite number, say n4, of linear difference equation models, all the coefficients in each model being non-zero, but otherwise unknown. With the help of the given observations, we will construct a statistic Di for the ith model which denotes the predictive capabilities of the model, having the following property for all i = 1,..., n4: E(Di) ≤ E(Dj) if ith model is true. Consequently, we prefer the ith model if the statistic Di has the smallest value among {D1,..,Dn 4}."
"A technique for generating correlated Weibull random variables is presented. The technique transforms a sequence of statistically independent Gaussian random variables into a sequence of correlated Weibull random variables which may be utilized in the generation of correlated clutter signals for digital simulations. Also, the technique may be used to generate Swerling I and III radar target signals which are partially correlated."
"We consider an information source which is an i.i.d. binary sequence governed by unknown probability measures. The information sequence is transferred through a memoryless binary channel with unknown cross-over probabilities. The channel model also represents those cases in which an input quantizer is always used, so that the incoming information-bearing observations are threshold crossings of the observation process, and the unknown cross-over probabilities are associated with uncertainties concerning the signal-to-noise ratio. We derive and study the optimal (under a minimum error-probability criterion) sequence estimator (which utilizes the observed threshold crossings). The receiver is described by a practically implementable algorithm which involves a shortest path calculation, which is performed using the Viterbi algorithm, and appropriately incorporates the sufficient statistics of the unknown parameters. Its similarity to unsupervised decision directed learning procedures is noted."
"The linear stochastic realization problem for a time-varying process with a smooth separable covariance is briefly described. It is shown that finding all Markovian realizations of the process is equivalent with finding all solutions to a set of constraints on the state-variances. Introducing a partial ordering on this set of nonnegative definite solutions [viz., Π1 ≥ Π2 if Π1 - Π2 is nonnegative definite] it is shown that the smallest solution, obtained with the help of a matrix minimality property, is the unique causal and causally invertible Markovian representation. A stochastic interpretation is given based on the fact that the state of the IR is the filtered estimate of the state of any other model."
"The subject of this paper is the application of stochastic control theory to resource allocation under uncertainty. In these problems it is assumed that the results of a given allocation of resources are not known with certainty, but that a limited number of experiments can be performed to reduce the uncertainty. The problem is to develop a policy for performing experiments and allocating resources on the basis of the outcome of the experiments such that a performance index is optimized. The problem is first analyzed using the stochastic dynamic programming approach. A computationally practical algorithm for obtaining an approximate solution is then developed. This algorithm preserves the \"closed-loop\" feature of the dynamic programming solution in that the resulting decision policy depends both on the results of past experiments and on the statistics of the outcomes of future experiments. In other words, the present decision takes into account the value of future information. The concepts are discussed in the context of the general problem of allocating resources to repair machines where it is possible to perform a limited number of diagnostic experiments to learn more about potential failures. Illustrative numerical results are given."
"The problem of controlling a class of linear systems with unknown parameters is considered. The optimal open-loop strategies are obtained for linear systems with unknown parameters in the system matrix with a quadratic performance index. The method of solution is based upon the use of the Hamilton-Jacobi theory. Robert B. Asher is with the Air Force Avionics Laboratory, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. Craig S. Sims is with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma. Henry R. Sebesta is with the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma."
"The concepts of a proprietary software product developed by Tetra Tech, Inc. are discussed. The model has been a useful decision-making aid for purchasing volatile commodities traded on exchanges used in production processes. The model assumes a finite planning horizon and fixed holding, interest, and in-out charges. Dynamic programming under uncertainty is used to develop purchase (and short sale) schedules for maintaining optimal inventory when price of raw material, demand for finished product, and many other factors are known only in terms of an estimated distribution function."
"A very important class of problems deals with the control of systems whose structure can undergo changes. The simplest class of changes are the ones that affect only the system parameters and not the rest of the basic structure of the system like order. In this paper we examine the class of linear, discrete time, multiple-input multiple-output systems, with additive system disturbances and exact output measurements. This class of models is also appropriate for describing some economic processes. The assumption will be that the system parameters can change according to a known low. The objective is to find the sequence of controls that will minimize a known cost of the output and the control sequence. We have assumed a quadratic cost. If the noise statistics and the initial conditions are assumed known, then the problem is an adaptive control one. We use dynamic programming to solve the resulting dual adaptive structure. We use an approximation to the optimal cost-to-go that renders the solution quite tractable. The approximation results in an actively adaptive law because it takes into account future measurements. The computational overhead required of this approximation is not too large, a property that renders the control law quite feasible. Some thought is given to what happens when some of the noise statistics are assumed not known with certainty, a case that is most appropriate in models of econcmic processes."
"By examining a particular hypothesis testing problem under a finite memory constraint we derive general guidelines for the design of asymptotically optimal, low complexity, finite memory decision rules. By asymptotically optimal we mean that only a fixed number of bits need be added to memory to achieve the optimal error probability. Thus the fraction of bits \"lost\" by these low complexity rules tends to zero as memory size becomes large. The rules developed are similar to quantized sequential probability ratio tests."
"It is shown how globally stable model reference adaptive control systems may be designed using only the plant's input and output signals. Controllers for single input-single output, nonlinear, nonautonomous plants are developed based on Liapunov's direct method and the Meyer-Kalman-Yacubovich lemma. Filtered derivatives of the plant output replace pure derivatives which are normally required in these systems. An augmented error signal replaces the error previously used which is the difference between the model and plant outputs. However, global stability is assured in the sense that this difference approaches zero asymptotically."
"Described in this paper is an application of variable structure stochastic automata to the solution of the hypothesis testing problem. Given the upper bounds on the error probabilities of the two kinds a design procedure for devising an algorithm for the stochastic automaton which ensures a proper decision is developed. The method is illustrated by an application to a simple detection problem of a known constant signal in additive gaussian noise."
"Optimal maintenance policies for a machine with degradation in performance with age and subject to failure are derived using optimal control theory. The optimal policies are shown to be, normally, of bang-coast nature, except in the case when probability of machine failure is a function of maintenance. It is also shown, in the deterministic case that a higher depreciation rate tends to reverse this policy to coast-bang. When the probability of failure is a function of maintenance, considerable computational effort is needed to obtain an optimal policy and the resulting policy is not easily implementable. For this case also, an optimal policy in the class of bang-coast policies is derived, using a semi-Markov decision model. A simple procedure for modifying the probability of machine failure with maintenance is employed. The results obtained extend and unify the recent results for this problem along both theoretical and practical lines. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the results obtained."
"A methodology is described for exploration and systematic development of the basis for a coalition of two social units. Considerable computer assistance is possible in developing the structural character of the basis. A joint intent structure and a conflict structure form the basis for consideration of a coalition, with three types of cycles being of special concern in the exploration."
"Our society is in a state of massive transition. For the first half of this century, resources were substantially unlimiting and manpower was in short supply. Now, the situation is almost reversed. Technological advances have made such claims on natural resources that they are now quickly becoming in short supply. The same technological advances have greatly reduced the need for manpower in many activities such as agriculture, mining and manufacturing. Accordingly, manpower presently is becoming very incompletely used in the traditional occupations. The deepening problems of unemployment have generated signs of uneasiness and panic. Some long-term moves to develop new potential uses for our presently unutilized human-resource pool seem clearly in order."
"Both analog and equivalent digital filters having adaptive capability are discussed. The analysis is restricted to second order sections but is extendable. Simple to implement gradient procedures using energy or phase information are used. Neither require supervised adaption. Applications include tracking nonstationary signals such as in seismic and acoustical sensing. Aside from the results shown, the tutorial nature of the paper establishes the need for further study to determine the optimum transformation that will minimize the interaction of the analog parameters (center frequency and bandwidth) in the transformed digital domain. It is suggested that this be realized by adaptive decorrelation, modification of the topological structures, and design of sm appropriate equivalent transformation."
"This paper summarizes two high-speed, adaptive modems for voice-band channels. The first is a 4800 bps, MOS/LSI modem which is almost entirely contained on 5 to 8 MOS/LSI chips, depending upon the version. The second modem is experimental and employs advanced, novel techniques for automatic equalization, carrier recovery, timing recovery, and jitter correction. Partial response, SSB signaling provides both high bandwidth efficiency and error correction without digit redundancy. Measured performance curves, including bit error rates, show that, under various transmission conditions, this modem provides outstanding performance. Implementation on a few MOS/ LSI chips or in an inexpensive signal processor is feasible."
"Adaptive antennas provide automatic adjustment of the radiation pattern to enhance the desired signal and minimize any interference sources that are present. Unfortunately, certain environments result in very slow convergence if conventional algorithms are used. This paper investigates the constraints that must be satisfied and presents computer simultation results for two unconventional techniques for accelerating convergence."
"A brief discussion of two types of tapped delay-line channel simulators which were built is presented: simulators which model the behavior of the channel, and simulators which reproduce the behavior of the channel. In the latter case, channel measurements were made to provide the control voltages for the reproduction. Some VHF simulation results are given. Adaptive functions of the receiver requiring simulator-type tests are discussed."
"The concepts of adaptive filtering theory are used in the development of the basic equations of the adaptive equalizer. The distortion function chosen to minimize is the mean square error. The digital implementation of the adaptive equalizer in a high speed PAM modem is described. That modem has successfully worked at 14 400 bits per second on voice telephone channels of the Autovon Network."
"This paper presents a general theory of convergence for optimization algorithms in which approximations are used. The theory indicates how the accuracy of the approximations can be controlled adaptively in order to insure convergence. The application of the theory to a parameter optimization problem for a non-linear dynamical system is briefly discussed."
"This paper presents several new algorithms for solving optimal control problems with general constraints on the control and inequality constraints on the terminal state. The algorithms are of the differential dynamic programming (strong variation) type. Thus the algorithms generate, at each iteration, a new control which is equal to a \"minimising\" control u on a subset Iα(u) ⊂ T and equal to the old control u elsewhere, where α =µ(Iαu) is the step length and T ⊂ [0,1]; this enables control constraints to be easily handled. Terminal inequality constraints are dealt with by incorporating features of non-linear programming algorithms of the feasible directions type. Convergence is proved using general results due to Polak and Klessig."
"This paper deals with the convergence of optimal control algorithms in the sense of control measures. Specifically, it shows, as a corollary, that most optimal control algorithms construct sequences of controls which always converge in cost to a local minimum."
"Practical and theoretical aspects of the use of spline functions in approximately solving open-loop optimal control problems are surveyed. It is shown how B-splines can be used to yield highly structured and sparse discrete approximations to the continuous problem; some computational methods useful on the resulting discrete problems are mentioned. The question of the accuracy obtainable by such methods is discussed."
"This paper summarizes an analysis of penalty and multiplier methods for constrained minimization, contained in Refs. [1-3]. We describe global convergence and rate of convergence results for multiplier methods, as well as a global duality theory for nonconvex problems. A main qualitative conclusion is that multiplier methods avoid to a substantial extent the traditional disadvantages of penalty methods (ill-conditioning, slow convergence) while retaining all of their attractive features."
"The purpose of this work is to formulate, analyze, and resolve structural stability of competitive economic systems in the Hicks-Metzler algebraic setting by using mathematical methods of the comparison principle and the vector Liapunov functions. A large economy is decomposed into interrelated sub-economies with time-varying interactions. Stability of the economy is determined on the basis of the aggregated stability properties of subeconomies and the nature of their interactions. It is shown that classical Hicks conditions can be used in the decomposition-aggregation analysis to establish stability of nonlinear economic models subject to structural variations caused by the time-varying interactions among the individual subeconomies."
"In this paper the discrete-time optimal control sensitivity problem is stated and a computationally convenient solution algorithm is reviewed. The algorithm is used to calculate the sensitivity of optimal public investment with respect to parameters in a regional model and welfare index. Implications of these results for regional development strategies are discussed."
"The notion of a goal has been useful in forming conceptual models about decision systems and in general about systems which exhibit purposeful behavior. While the term \"goal\" is used quite frequently it is surprising that such an intuitively useful notion has remained so ambiguous. This paper formalizes the notion of a goal and discusses some of its properties and characteristics. This formalization provides a structure within which one can compare goals, check the consistency of composite goal structrues and analyze harmony and conflict in (hierarchical) multiple goal systems."
"The question of rational behavior in dynamic non-cooperative games of incomplete information is examined. Two formulations of rationality are presented. In the first approach a player reduces his game to an 'adaptive' optimal control problem. The second approach amounts to a generalization of Nash equilibrium theory. The author discusses the applicability of the two models in light of both philosophical and technical differences between them. Both approaches are shown to accommodate Me concept of 'strategic' learning as an aspect of rational behavior. However the two differ in their ability to model or to prescribe the appealing notion of 'tacit cooperation' familiar in prisoner's dilemma games. In the last section an optimality criterion is proposed to help clarify the circumstances under which cooperation is rational."
"A class of differential games with two pursuers versus one evader is investigated for Nash equilibrium solutions. The solutions show that the state space can be partitioned into the following three regions: (i) the evader, E, plays a two-player, nonzero-sum differential game against one of the two pursuers, P, and ignores the other pursuer, Q; (ii) the evader plays a two-player, nonzero-sum differential game against Q and ignores P; (iii) the evader plays against both of the pursuers. A specific example is examined to illustrate how the theory can be applied."
"The purpose of mathematical organization theory is to explain in a reasonably quantitative fashion some of the basic characteristics which are observed in organizations of man and/or machines in practice. Such a theory is outlined below. It is based on the assumption that many organizations are designed to execute certain complex tasks which exceed the capacities of their components. With these capacities suitably defined, one is in fact led to organizations whose structures and standard operating procedures bear a remarkable resemblance to those observed in practice."
 "We give an algorithm for solving the Padé approximation problem for matrix sequences over an arbitrary field. The algorithm is a multivariate version of one first proposed by Berlekamp and Massey in a coding theory context, the extension being obtained using matrix-fraction descriptions of multivariable systems. The algorithm is recursive and seems to have some computational advantages. Furthermore, our results are in a form that permits easy determination of state-space models from the transfer functions, solving what is called the partial realization problem. Our algorithm also shows how to obtain a characterization of the invariants of this problem."
"The well-known Routh and Jury tabular schemes for determination of linear system zero location relative to the left half plane and unit disc respectively are formulated as special cases of two algorithms for finding the greatest common divisor of two polynomials. Two recent extensions of the tabular methods are expressed similarly, and this enables a previously unknown 'duality' property of the two zero location algorithms to be demonstrated. Namely, that a Routh-type array can be applied to the unit disc problem, and a Jury-type array to the left half plane problem, and these applications occur in a precisely symmetrical fashion. Extensions are given for complex polynomials, and remarks are made on the problem of coefficient growth during array construcion."
"In this paper, a canonical form for state-space representation of time-delay systems will be derived. The approach taken here is to convert the state-space representation into a set of ordinary differential-difference equations of particular form and then synthesize such equations back to the canonical structure. Emphasis will be given to the simple cases of second and third order scalar time-delay systems."
 "For a constant linear dynamic system with unmeasurable disturbances, geometric necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of a state-feedback controller that localizes the disturbances and simultaneously assigns the closed-loop poles or decouples the closed-loop system. These conditions are simple, intuitively appealing, and closely related to the known necessary and sufficient conditions for the separate problems to be solvable alone. Furthermore, it is shown that for these combined problems no additional flexibility is afforded by using dynamic compensation instead of static compensation except for the combined problem of disturbance localization and decoupling where the additional flexibility is derived from that for the decoupling problem alone. Under a standard rank assumption, it is established that the combined problem of simultaneously localizing the disturbances, assigning the poles and decoupling the system has no solution."
"The problem of making the transfer function between disturbances and controlled outputs identically zero by using state feed-back, feedforward control and dynamic compensation in a linear time invariant system is treated and a constructive solvability condition is presented."
"A point set with a partial order (poset) P is a useful \"generalized time\" set for linear system theory, since the fundamental concept of causality can be defined for linear operators on a function space on P. The causal-operator algebra has a rich structure, known to combinatorists. Specializing to posets which admit shift operators, some novel generalizations of time-invariance are obtained; P becomes an ordered semigroup. A Kalman-Wyman algebraic system theory is indicated for these systems."
"This paper starts with a brief review of the syntactic (linguistic) approach to pattern recognition. One-dimensional and high dimensional languages for pattern description and recognition are domenstated by application examples. Several problems motivated by practical applications of syntactic pattern recognition are discussed. In applying syntactic approach to pattern recognition problems, abstract pattern primitives are often required. A sentence structure representing a pattern can then be analyzed with respect to the given pattern grammers. Pattern matching or/and syntax analysis (parsing) is in general used as a recognition procedure. In practical applications, noise and distortion involving in the pattern measurements are unavoidable. A perfect recognition of primitives and the relations among them would be very difficult, even with excessive proprocessing and sophisticated recognition techniques. Consequently, ambiguity often occurs. Also, at the present, patterns grammars are primarily constructed by the designer. The quality of a heuristically constructed grammar in terms of its pattern descriptive capability is difficult to evaluate. Such a grammer may generate sentences representing unwanted patterns or it may not be able to describe the patterns in the same class which have not occurred before. There is a need to have systematic learning or inference procedures which will learn (with generalization) a pattern grammer from a set of training patterns. With these practical considerations in mind the following topics and their potential applications are then discussed: (1) transformational grammers, (2) stochastic grammers and languages, (3) syntax analysis in the presence of errors and (4) grammatical inference."
"Sufficient conditions for the stability of self-organizing control algorithms based on a subgoal approach are given. A method is presented which aids in the a-priori choice of the structure of the feedback control law under the assumption that on-line or off-line identification of the structure of the plant has been accomplished. Subsequent to closing the loop, bounds, which depend on the control law chosen on the performance index say be estimated. Illustrative examples are presented."
"This paper presents adaptive universal fault-tolerant logic arrays which have cellular structures, low numbers of input-output terminals, and are thus compatible with large scale integration technology. These cellular arrays can implement fault-tolerant digital systems capable of adapting on-line to realize any logic function on a given number of variables. The same simple adaptation algorithm employed to realize either a completely specified or an incompletely specified logic function is also used for dynamic error correction (on-line repair). The adaptive fault-tolerant cellular arrays are based on a proposed redundant decomposition of a switching function. A two-rail scheme of such arrays is shown to be capable of both error detection and dynamic error correction through adaptation. A comparison is carried out, which indicates that the reliability of the two-rail scheme is better than that of TMR schemes, for a comparable cost in hardware."
"The problem of the minimization of a functional of several parameters is treated. It is supposed that the gradient of the functional is known but the stochastic approximation method cannot be applied since its convergence is not guaranteed due to the form of the functional. A mixed random search-stochastic approximation method insuring this convergence is developed. Several applications in the field of pattern recognition are highlighted."
"In an adaptive quantizer that has been used for speech encoding, the entire amplitude range expands or contracts by a multiplicative constant after each input sample. The constant, Mi, depends only on the magnitude of the current quantizer output. Assuming independent identically distributed input samples, we show that the sequence of quantizer ranges is a stochastically stable process. Furthermore, we derive a key design equation, Σpi(X) log Mi=0, where Pi(X) is the steady-state probability that a quantized sample lies in the ith magnitude level when the ratio of quantizer range scale to rms signal level is X. A designer may specify X and solve this equation for multipliers that provide the desired steady state performance. There are many such sets of multipliers and we show that the adaptation time constant associated with each set depends on MN/Ml, the ratio of largest to smallest multiplier."
"The application of Kalman-Bucy filters entails precise knowledge on the a priori noise covariances as well as the system parameters. In many practical cases, however, such precise knowledge is not available, and approximate values are usually used or assumed. It has been pointed out that incorrect covariances often cause severe inconsistency between the calculated error covariance and the actual one. Approaches of adaptive filtering have been studied by various researchers for mainly time-invariant systems. An iterative procedure for the adaptation of the assumed a priori observation-noise covariances of time-variable systems is investigated in this paper. The procedure proposed here computes at each iteration a necessary correction from the covariances of the innovation process, and adapt the noise covariances thereby. The calculated error covariance is shown to tend to the actual in the limit. Simulated examples show that initial choices of the a priori covariance do not seem to be crucial to the convergence. An approach to adaptive filtering is also proposed."
"The signatures of remote sensing data from agricultural crops exhibit significant non-stationarity, so that the performance of fixed parameter classifiers degenerates with time and distance from the initial training data. A class of adaptive decision-directed classifiers are being developed, based on Kalman filter theory. Limited results to date on two data sets indicate approximately a 25%-40% reduction in rates of misclassification."
"A generalized Bush-Mosteller learning model is discussed simulating both finite memory range learning and infinite memory range imprinting processes, as well as an ideal learning scheme storing all experiences with equal weight. The learning and imprinting dynamics in stationary and non-stationary environments is studied using as a performance criterion the relative entropy of the true with respect to the system's subjective environmental probabilities. For the stationary case learning and imprinting schemes exhibit a symmetrical performance which is nearly optimal for small deviations from the ideal learning scheme. In the non-stationary case imprinting schemes perform poorly, while proper learning processes are capable of keeping the relative entropy at a low level. Their optimal memory range is calculated in terms of the environmental fluctuation time."
"The past contributions of NASA to adaptive control technology is reviewed. The review places emphasis on aircraft applications although spacecraft and launch vehicle control applications are included. Particular emphasis is given to the adaptive control system used in the X-15 research aircraft. Problem areas that limited the realizable performance of this adaptive system are discussed. Current technological capabilities are used to extrapolate the present-day potential for adaptive flight control. Specifically, the potential created by use of the modern high-speed digital computer in flight control is discussed. Present plans for research in digital adaptive control systems for the NASA F8-C digital fly-by-wire program are presented. These plans are currently envisioned to include research in at least two types of adaptive controls, the system identification/on-line design type, and the model reference type. The former type is expected to provide spin-off in other important experimental test programs. One spin-off relates to the use of online system identification to improve flight-test procedures. Another relates to the use of self-reorganizing control concepts to establish an on-line design capability that takes advantage of the maximum level of redundancy provided by the entire aircraft control system. This plan would make the flight control system optimally tolerant of system failures in both sensors and actuators."
"A transportation control system maintains the flow of traffic according to a schedule by implementing various policies (e.g. procedures, rules, priorities, etc.). In a conventional control system the schedule is fixed and the policies are deterministic. An adaptive control system, on the other hand, has an internal mechanism for altering its policies which, in turn, adjust the schedule in response to demand and system status. An adaptive control system combines five basic functions: (1) surveillance, to detect traffic; (2) communications, to relay surveillance data and control signals; (3) performance evaluation, to compare the difference between the desired and current operation; (4) on-line data processing, to determine the control signals and scheduling; and (5) overall system operation, i.e., the functional summation of (1), (2), (3) and (4). An ultimate system would also generate predictions of future demand which would be factored into the control adaptation process. This paper summarizes recent progress in the implementation of adaptive control systems in transportation. The applications discussed include control of freeway ramps, urban street traffic, air traffic, and urban rapid transit."
"Pattern recognition and its application to ocean surveillance and the near-real-time screening of tactical reconnaissance imagery presented to the pilot were chosen as a typical adaptive systems project in the Navy. The performance of a pattern-recognition device is compared with that of a human operator. It is concluded that the human operator will make the final decision, but he will be aided by a pattern-recognition device. The interpretation of unfamiliar information such as radar imagery or radar range profiles poses considerable problems for the human operator, and therefore pattern recognition is needed the most in this area. The basic pattern recognition process is briefly described and an example is given of processing techniques for pattern recognition which were implemented. The requirements and the need for a pattern-recognition device for ocean surveillance and near-real-time automatic screening of tactical resonnaissance information are outlined."
"Linear and nonlinear adaptive algorithms for coping with intersymbol interference and additive noise in high speed data transmission over time-dispersive channels are presented. The algorithms perform the signal detection function and simultaneously, either directly or indirectly, estimate the channel for the purpose of identifying the characteristics of the inter-symbol interference. The stability and the convergence properties of the algorithms are treated as well as their performance capabilities."
"This paper attempts to survey our knowledge, and the practical scope of our use of, the method of conjugate gradients and its close relatives in the numerical solution of problems of quadratic and nonquadratic optimization."
"This paper describes the evolution of modern secant methods and compares their performance."
"The convergence rates of descent methods with different stepsize rules are compared. Among the stepsize rules considered are: constant stepsize, minimization along a line, Goldstein-Armijo rules, and stepsize equal to minimum of certain interpolatory polynomials. One of the major results shown is that the rate of convergence of descent methods with the Goldstein-Armijo stepsize rule can be made as close as desired to the rate of convergence of methods that require minimization along a line. Also, a descent algorithm that combines a Goldstein-Armijo stepsize rule with a secant-type step is presented. It is shown that this algorithm has a convergence rate equal to the convergence of descent methods that require minimization along a line and that, eventually (i.e. near the minimum), it does not require a search to determine an acceptable stepsize."
"This paper surveys some of the unifying approaches used to derive formulae for updating the inverse Hessian approximations in quasi-Newton algorithms and presents a new approach of this kind based on geometric considerations. The paper discusses the intuitive motivations for these approaches and their potential in providing explanations for observed behavior of such algorithms."
"A combined primal-dual and penalty method is given for solving the nonlinear programming problem. The algorithm generalizes the \"method of multipliers\" and is applicable to problems with both equality and inequality constraints. The algorithm is defined for a broad class of \"penalized Lagrangians,\" and is shown to be globally convergent when applied to the convex programming problem. The duality aspects are explored, leading to geometrical interpretations of the method and its relationship to generalized Lagrange multipliers. The rate of convergence is given and the method is shown to be superior to ordinary penalty methods."
"The performance of hybrid navigation systems for commercial transoceanic flights is evaluated by means of a digital computer simulation. Error models are developed for aided-inertial navigation systems with external measurements from Doppler radar, Omega and satellite-ranging. Key features of the simulation program AIRNAV (Aided-Inertial Reference NAVigation) are described. Covariance matrix error analysis is used to obtain the navigation error histories, with recursive navigation techniques to incorporate the measurements. A 34th-order error state vector is defined, which requires the numerical integration of up to 585 first-order differential equations to propagate the covariance matrix. Example computer results are presented for a typical North Atlantic flight."
"This paper describes a technique for combining satellite tracking and user receiver error statistics to compute resultant user navigation errors. In addition, an error allocation technique is developed that permits the direct computation of the percentage contributions of ground tracking, satellite and user error sources to total user navigation errors. Significant insights into the relationship between satellite tracking and user navigation accuracy are shown."
"This paper describes some design considerations of a navigation filter for an unmanned aircraft. Emphasis is on a simple, but accurate approach to navigation. Design considerations are discussed for the implementation of a fixed gain extended Kalman filter. Representative sensors including true airspeed, doppler, and LORAN are described, and their integration into a modular navigation system is explained."
"For a two-aircraft encounter, the computer realization of a cooperative horizontal collision avoidance system is analyzed. The system is based on range, relative bearing, relative heading and speed ratio information, and the realization accounts for the turn dynamics of both aircraft."
"Aggregate (or macro-) econometric models are systems of equations designed to represent the basic quantitative relationships among, and the behavior over time of, such major economic variables as national income, consumption, investment, employment, the price level, etc. They vary greatly in size, complexity, dynamic characteristics, and estimation methods. Increasingly, large quarterly models with non-linearities in variables are constructed and consistent estimation methods are used. The models serve the purposes of testing macroeconomic hypotheses, simulating the effects of alternative policies, and forecasting changes in the economy. The results are mixed and partly inconclusive but the potential contributions of the models are large. My assignment in this paper is to describe briefly what macroeconometric models are and how they are used. I shall try to give a general survey of the principal topics in this broad and growing area of study, in the belief that they are of sufficient interest to an audience of professionals from different but not unrelated fields."
"The stabilization trade-off between Inflation and unemployment is investigated in a continuous time growth model where disequilibrium can occur in the labor market. The emphasis of the paper is on the policy implications of rational expectations, as an alternative to adaptive expectations. The rational expectations approach is useful in describing the way in which a particular policy plan alters economic agents' expectations of future inflation rates. It is shown that it is not possible to achieve an unemployment rate which is deterministically different from the equilibrium rate, when economic agents form expectations rationally."
"This paper examines the use of linearly optimal policies in systems which are in fact nonlinear. Any linear representation of a non-linear system involves some loss of information about the system, and this loss of information in general leads linearly optimal policies to differ from corresponding nonlinearly optimal policies which are truly optimal. This paper indicates the nature of the resulting discrepancies in a stochastic framework and reports on results of several numerical experiments dealing with macroeconomic stabilization policy."
 "A simple macroscopic freeway traffic corridor model is formulated for the purpose of developing optimal allocations of freeway on-ramp metering volumes. The model represents a unidirectional freeway and a single parallel \"equivalent surface street\" which are interconnected by freeway on-ramps. Since a choice of routes is included in the proglem formulation, the fairly standard methodology of \"traffic assignment\" is employed to predict how drivers will react to the on-ramp metering. An explicit traffic assignment algorithm which includes ramp queueing is developed. Both the corridor and traffic assignment models are restricted to stationary traffic patterns. Two specific corridor performance criteria, freeway travel rate and total travel time rate, are formulated in terms of the model variables. Then the problem of choosing ramp metering volumes to optimize a performance criterion is posed. A computationally efficient suboptimal dynamic programming scheme is developed and illustrated by example."
"In this paper a model for the longitudinal dynamics of a multi-locomotive powered train is developed. Using this model the theory of the LQG problem is applied to the problem of minimizing coupler forces in the train consist while maintaining a practical schedule velocity. The controllers developed are easily realized and in one form provide commands for throttle setting changes to a human operator. Experimental results are presented for a 62 car consist traversing a severe grade with locomotives placed at the front, middle and end of the consist. For these experiments the controllers developed were found to meet the system specifications."
"This paper reports on the construction of a crossword puzzle generator. After an unsuccessful attempt to construct puzzles by whole word insertion, puzzles were constructed letter by letter. Heuristically determined decision structure was required. The constructor resolved questions of letter selection, ordering and reordering of the solution sequence, dictionary structure and access, and decision path selection. The decision basis for letter selection was based on a psuedo-probabilistic approach."
"This paper considers some of the sociological problems and benefits which must be anticipated by any community which is planning a major TV cable system with a large, on-line computer system at the cable head, providing a large-scale data retrieval and store-and-forward system. We will confine the discussion to the impact of (and on) the provision of data services. The University of Illinois experiment has already shown the basic technical feasibility of such a system for 4000 active users.1"
"An important problem in manual control concerns the identification of human operator model parameters from measured data. This paper considers the identifiability properties of the optimal control model structure for the human operator. The formulation of the model may be summarized as follows [1]: Let the plant dynamics be given by x(t) = Ax(t) + bu(t) + w(t) (1) where the n-vector x(t) is the plant state vector, u(t) is the human's scalar control input to the system, and w(t) represents random external disturbances assumed to be zero-mean, Gaussian and white with covariance W."
"In this paper, the function of visual system was mainly analysed by spatio-temperal characteristics based upon Enroth's model, Broca-Sulzer phenomenon and Mach effect. (a) In order to get the excitatory and inhibitory potential of intermediate cell layer in the retina, the exponential value exp {(FM/kT)-Imn} was calculated based on the physiological theory in neuro-phenomena. (b) To show the visual characteristics by the analog simulation for generating stimulus waveforms and analysis, the visual adaptation was recorded as electrical stimulation in the form of step functions. Furthermore, it was shown that there was a satisfactory agreement within experimental errors between those data obtained and the theoretical values, which is psycho-physiological."
"This paper considers input forcing function selection for discriminating among alternative structural models and for estimating parameters of functional models. The model outputs are corrupted by an additive noise source, which represents the so-called breath-to-breath variation in the observation of a ventilation response to an end-tidal CO2-O2 forcing function input. The problem of forcing function selection for model discrimination is formulated around minimizing the probability of error in model selection while the problem of forcing function selection for model parameter estimation is formulated around minimizing the parameter estimation error variance. Forcing function selection is illustrated by considering end-tidal CO2 inputs that enhance parameter estimation for a functional model that summarizes normoxic respiratory controller behavior."
"This paper attempts a unified presentation of general schemes using Lyapunov's direct method for (i) the adaptive control and (ii) the identification of multivariable systems. The first part deals with cases where all the state variables of the plant are accessible. In the second part, an adaptive observer is synthesized to identify the plant parameters and to simultaneously estimate the plant state vector, when only the output of the system is accessible."
"This paper considers the problem of estimating the state of a discrete linear time-invariant system when the noise statistics are unknown. In the absent of any knowledge of the noise statistics, an observer with a fixed gain can be used in estimating the state. When more observation information is accumulated, the estimation performance can be improved by directly adjusting the gain of the observer adaptively. An adaptive observer is developed which will converge in mean square to the optimum filter asymptotically."
"The problem of estimating the state of a linear dynamic system driven by additive gaussian noise with unknown time varying statistics is considered. Estimates of the state of the system are obtained which are based on all past observations of the system. These observations are linear functions of the state contaminated by additive white gaussian noise with unknown time varying statistics. The case of scalar measurements is given first and the more general solution for vector measurements is stated. A previously developed algorithm designed for use in the case of stationary noise is modified to allow estimation of an unknown Kalman gain and thus the system state in the presence of unknown time varying noise statistics. The algorithm is inherently parallel in nature and if implemented in a computer with parallel processing capability should only be slightly slower than the stationary Kalman filtering algorithm with known noise statistics. Numerical examples for both the scalar and vector measurement cases are given."
"This paper describes a specific postflight data analysis (PFDA) technique, which is termed adaptive, iterated, extended Kalman filtering (AIEKF), and illustrates the application of this PFDA tool to the estimation of aerodynamic coefficients (Cx, CN, and Cm) for a single-axis model of a thrust-vector-controlled missile."
"In this paper, a comprehensive look is taken at the Newton-Raphson method of solving the algebraic matrix Riccati equation. Its important numerical properties and computational requirements are also discussed."
"The solution of the Riccati equation corresponding to the Kalman filter, with a single perfect measurement and possibly one or more noisy measurements, requires the numerical integration of a nonlinear matrix differential equation whose dimension is one less than that of the system state vector. A similar requirement exists for the linear regulator problem when one of the controls has no penalty and the others, if they exist are penalized. One would think that similar requirements would exist when the single measurement is almost perfect and the single control is only slightly penalized; however, not only is the dimension of the matrix differential equations increased (it is equal to the dimension of the state), the small numbers make the solution ill-conditioned. Approximations to these ill-conditioned Riccati matrices are derived along with measures of the slight degradations in the performances of the estimators and regulators resulting from their use."
"The paper is an outline of a talk that will survey some algorithms that have recently been developed for linear estimation in dynamical systems with time-invariant parameters. The algorithms have potential numerical advantages and in particular require less effort than the Kalman filter. Special cases of the algorithms are closely related to certain early (1947) work in astrophysics by So Chandrasekhar and in estimation by N. Levinson. The algorithms can be used to solve several other problems beside estimation. Furthermore, they are closely related to algorithms for minimal realization and for system inversion."
"A new algorithm for solving discrete time linear-quadratic control problems is given. This algorithm is shown to be a special case of the \"structure algorithm\" used for characterizing properties of linear systems. It is also shown to be related to the Chandrasekhar-type equations recently introduced by Kailath."
"In a large class of multi-loop control systems, many feedback loops are \"closed\" through a timeshared digital computer, using algorithms which require information from sources which are sampled at a rate which is not synchronized with the sampling of the individual \"Plants\". This mis-synchronization, in conjunction with variations in the computer's task load caused by \"interrupts\", results in a randomly time-varying delay in the closing of the various feedback loops. Consequently, the dynamics of each controlled \"plant\" in such a system may be modeled by means of a stochastic delay-differential equation. This paper presents some new research resets concerning the sample stability (as opposed to statistical, or ensemble stability) of non-linear stochastic delay-differential equations."
"The problem of developing L2-stability criteria for feedback systems with a single time-varying gain, which impose average variation constraints on the gain is treated. A unified approach is presented which facilitates the development of such average variation criteria for both linear and nonlinear systems. The stability criteria derived here are shown to be more general than the existing results."
"This paper reports a reasonably complete theory of necessary and sufficient conditions for a control to be superior with respect to a non-scalar-valued performance criterion. The latter maps into a finite-dimensional integrally closed directed partially ordered linear space. The applicability of the theory to the analysis of dynamic vector estimation problems and to a class of uncertain optimal control problems is demonstrated."
"The problem of characterizing optimal controls for a class of distributed parameter systems is considered. The system dynamics are characterized mathematically by a finite number of coupled partial differential equations involving first-order time and space derivatives of the state variables. Boundary conditions on the state are in the form of a finite number of algebraic relations between the state and boundary control variables. The performance index is an integral over the spatial domain of penalty functions on the terminal state and on the distributed state and controls. Variational methods are used to derive first- and second-order necessary conditions for a control which minimizes the performance index. Of particular interest are conditions on the boundary value of the costate and on the optimal boundary controls."
"A class of singular quadratic minimization problems is examined by reducing the performance index to a quadratic form in the control variable. A necessary and sufficient condition for minimality is that the kernel of this quadratic form be non-negative definite, or equivalently, be a covariance kernel (function). Various properties of such functions are then used to obtain different sets of necessary and sufficient conditions. The present paper deals only with those properties of covariances that do not involve differentiability or integrability conditions. The properties include non-negative definiteness, continuity, symmetry, and factorizability. A study of these properties yields natural interpretations of a number of quantities and conditions which arise in singular quadratic minimization theory."
"A set of sufficient conditions for a weak minimum is derived for a form of the nonsingular Bolza problem of variational calculus, with interior point constraints and discontinuities in the system equations. Generalized versions of the conjugate point/focal point, normality, convexity and nontangency conditions associated with the ordinary Bolza problem are obtained. The resulting set of sufficient conditions is minimal, in that only minor modifications are required in order to obtain necessary conditions for normal, nonsingular problems of this form. These conditions are relatively easy to implement. Analogous second-order optimality conditions for problems with natural corners or control constraints are also obtained. Previously stated sufficiency conditions for problems with control constraints are shown to be unnecessarily restrictive, in some cases."
"This paper presents a functional analysis solution to the discrete optimal control problem with quadratic cost functional, dealing with the case of unconstrained control and fixed endpoints."
"We present a rigorous approach to nonlinear estimation of signals in additive white Gaussian noise using the innovations method. The general argument is deliberately chosen to follow the same lines as in the linear case given in a previous note. Although a much heavier use of martingales is necessary here, the parallelism is quite striking."
 "Whereas previous studies have indicated that Chebyshev estimation procedures should be readily applicable to parameter identification problems, little experimental work has been reported. To this effect, a quasilinearization-linear programming approach was used to estimate the elements appearing in the discrete transition matrix for a stabilized missile roll control system. Results indicate that Chebyshev estimation is best for a system with bounded measurement noise (i.e., quantization or roundoff noise) and gives improved estimates as the number of samples increases."
"A new algorithm is proposed for estimating the state of a nonlinear stochastic system when only noisy observations of the state are available. The state estimation problem is formulated as a modaltrajectory maximum-likelihood estimation problem. The resulting minimization problem is analogous to the nonlinear tracking problem in optimal control theory. By viewing the system as an interconnection of lower-dimensional subsystems and applying the so-called ϵ-coupling technique, which originated in the study of the sensitivity of control systems to parameter variations, a near-optimal state estimation algorithm is derived which has the properties that all computations can be performed in parallel at the subsystem level and only linear equations need be solved. The principal attraction of the method is that significant reductions in the computational requirements relative to other approximate algorithms can be achieved when the system is large-dimensional."
"The Dyer-McReynolds square root information filter (SRIF) is rederived, using recursive least squares arguments. The result is applied to a system composed partly of biases. The filter \"sensitivity\" matrix, \"computed\" covariance, and \"consider\" covariance for this augmented system are reviewed. A new computationally attractive representation for the smoothed estimates, in terms of a smoothed \"sensitivity\" matrix and a smoothed \"computed\" covariance is presented."
"A method is presented for estimating the parameters of a fixed order autoregressive moving average model, based on maximization of an appropriate likelihood function. The resulting static optimization is accomplished with a modified Newton numerical algorithm. Under suitable initial conditions for the model, the gradient and hessian matrices of each iteration can be compted analytically. Because of the highly nonlinear character of the likelihood function, starting values of the algorithm are important. Extensions of the method to more complicated models are described. Some numerical examples illustrate the properties of the method."
"The solution to a continuous-time LQG minimax terminal state estimation problem is obtained using a Hilbert space approach. The minimax decision rule is determined via the method of least favorable prior distributions. The minimax estimator is shown to be a linear functional of the observed data, and the least favorable prior distribution is shown to be a degenerate Gaussian stochastic process."
"Some simple mathematical models relating to various attributes of a route network are presented. These models include number and duration of potential conflicts, intersection and air route capacity, flight and route mileage, and intersection density. Using these models enables a designer to compare quantitatively the various network design alternatives. An outline of a computer program that systematically computes the various attributes is presented."
"This paper addresses the design and evaluation of those units of airspace (sectors) under the jurisdiction of a team of air traffic controllers. The limitations of the current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) criterion for the creation of new sectors are discussed, and other necessary considerations are enumerated. A methodology for sector design and evaluation is described that is sensitive to these additional features. The technique relates the traffic variables, route and sector geometry, and control procedures to the decision-making time (DMT) required on the part of the air traffic control (ATC) team. The term \"decision-making time\" is used synonymously with \"controller work load,\" which constitutes the required sector evaluation criterion when overall ATC facility capacity and manning efficiency are desired."
"In pattern recognition and other forms of data analysis, the investigator would like to find the parameters which most efficiently describe the data. This is useful for feature extraction and to gain insight into the meaning of the data. A number of techniques have been developed to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of a data set. This paper describes a technique which utilizes the interactive capabilities of computer graphics to find a nonlinear transformation to project the data into its intrinsic parameter space."
"This paper describes a CAI (computer-aided instruction) system which is based on algorithms for problem generation and solution. A heuristic monitor has been developed which tailors the path taken by each student through the course concepts in accordance with his previous performance. This monitor will be described as well as general techniques for problem generation and solution monitoring."
"The paper addresses both the discrete and continuous time linear-quadratic control problem with an arbitrary number of controllers each of which is making proprietary measurements. To force a tractable solution, the structure of the controllers have been fixed, resulting in a time varying matrix parameter optimization problem. Necessary conditions for the solution of the discretized problem are given. The analogous conditions for the continuous case are referenced; viz., the document from which this paper is an abridgement. An example is considered which permits comparison of the solutions developed here to that resulting from the separation principle."
"The problem of control of a stochastic system with control dependent noise is investigated. Both the system driving noise and system measurement noise are assumed to have control dependent terms. The approximation of neglecting higher order terms in the control is introduced in the derivation of the a posteriori conditional covariance matrices of the system state. These approximate conditional covariance matrices are used in a stochastic dynamic programming algorithm to obtain a linear feedback law. The control feedback matrices multiplying the estimates for system state are not those of the equivalent deterministic system and the separation theorem in its usual form does not apply to this class of problems. The control policy given by the algorithm reduces to the optimal control policy in two cases in which the optimal control is known. These are the case of no control dependent noise and the case of no measurement noise. A third order numerical example is investigated to illustrate the nature of the algorithm."
"An optimal control in a stochastic system is often one which minimizes the mean value of a specified performance index. Exclusive concern with this single parameter of dynamic response may mask anomalous behavior which occurs with small probability. Before utilizing an optimal controller further study of its properties is warranted. This paper provides an algorithm for finding an approximation to the least favorable trajectory for the system."
"A cost functional, which is the integral of a cost rate over a random time, is associated with a control system described by a stochastic differential equation. The control policy is confined to measurable Markov controls. In connection to the problem of selecting a minimizing control, two results are shown in this paper. The first one is the continuity dependence of the cost functional on controls, i.e., it is shown that if a sequence of controls converges weakly to a control then the corresponding sequence of the cost functionals converges to the cost functional corresponding to the limiting control. Using this result, the second one is to show an existence theorem of optimal stochastic controls among an appropriate set of admissible controls under some assumptions."
"In this paper, a computer control technique for controlling a class of largely uncertain multivariable plants using model tracking method is presented. The approach uses a \"Two-level\" controller, with a feedforward controller on its first-level, and a conditional feedback controller on its second-level. The design procedure presented employs the deterministic type Liapunov signal synthesis procedure which can be implemented on a suitable digital computer, and does not need an explicit knowledge of the plant."
"This paper deals with the realization of a best approximation of an unknown optimal decision rule by means of a self-learning hierarchical system. This optimization implies the simultaneous use of adaptive estimation and classification techniques. An unsupervised learning discrete algorithm based on stochastic approximation theory is proposed as a solution to this problem. Some applications are suggested, particularly, in the field of modelling of static and dynamic non-linear relationships. Numerical results are given."
"This paper introduces a measure of the ability for a pattern classifier to discriminate among different pattern classes. The use of this measure then defines a compromise between pattern discrimination and recognition error. The measure is particularly useful in sequential pattern classification in allowing control of discrimination level versus recognition error. The trade-off between discrimination level and recognition error is demonstrated for data used in a medical diagnosis problem."
"The problem of rapid automatic equalization of a highly distorting wireline channel is considered. An appropriate training signal received through the channel is processed by a 100-tap transversal filter comprising the equalizer and subsequently compared with a locally available properly synchronized reference signal. Errors between these two signals motivate a steepest descent (SD) controller to iteratively synthesize the equalizer's impulse response which tends to minimize the mean-squared error. Using matrix notation, a deterministic analysis leads to a mathematical block diagram of the equalizer system. A computer-simulated example demonstrates the effectiveness of the process in a specific case. The evolution of the equalizer's impulse response is summarized graphically in a \"learning surface\". Implementation considerations lead to a nearly optimal but considerably simplified system. Smoothing techniques allow for effective equalization in the presence of white additive noise. Experimental observations support predicted results."
"This paper describes the development and operation of a vehicle scheduling algorithm which has applications to the NASA problem of assigning payloads to space delivery vehicles. The algorithm is based on a discrete, integer-valued, non-serial, dynamic programming solution to the classical problem of developing resource utilization plans with limited resources. The algorithm places special emphasis on incorporating interpayload (precedence) relationships; maintaining optimal alternate schedule definitions (a unique feature of dynamic programming) in the event of contingencies (namely, resource inventory changes) without problem resolution; and, by using a special information storage technique, reducing the computational complexity of solving realistic problems. This information storage technique is demonstrated with a brief example. Reference is made to an operational computer program which solves the problem of assigning payloads to space delivery vehicles."
"Many future NASA programs require very high accurate pointing stability. These pointing requirements are well beyond anything attemped to date. This paper suggests a control system which has the capability of meeting these requirements. An optimal control law for the suggested system is specified. However, since no direct method of solution is known for this complicated system, a computation technique using successive approximations is used to develop the required solution. The method of calculus of variations is applied for estimating the changes of index of performance as well as those constraints of inequality of state variables and terminal conditions. Thus, an algorithm is obtained by the steepest descent method and/or conjugate gradient method. Numerical examples are given to show the optimal controls."
"This paper treats variable structure systems with vector control inputs. Each component of the control vector is discontinuous on a corresponding surface in the system coordinate space. In such systems, sliding modes may arise and then trajectories lie on the discontinuity surfaces or their intersections. A so-called method of equivalent control is suggested which allows formal development of equations of such motions. The validity of the sliding mode equations derived through the equivalent control approach is established by introduction into the system of small nonidealities (of hysteresis, time-lag, and a periodic type) which are then made to tend to zero. It is suggested that Liapunov stability concepts be applied to derive the conditions for existence of sliding modes. It follows from the equations describing system evolution in the sliding mode that trajectory characteristics are dependent on the discontinuity surfaces equations. Therefore, proper selection of the surfaces on which the components of the control vector are discontinuous enables one to introduce desired properties into the system response. A desired response can be obtained if the trajectory reaches the intersection of the discontinuity surface starting from any initial state, and that at each point of the intersection the existence conditions for the sliding mode hold. The paper considers different methods of variable structure systems synthesis on the basis of the sliding modes being deliberately introduced into the system. Algorithms are described for controlling plants with both constant and variable parameters, and also plants with external disturbances. A class of systems is indicated in which evolution in the sliding mode possesses invariance with respect to variable parameters and disturbances."
"This paper considers the problem of designing a decentralized feedback controller for a class of interconnected linear dynamical systems. The structure of each local controller is constrained to be such that it can be defined via a constant output feedback matrix, and necessary conditions for the resulting parameter optimization problem are given in the form of simultaneous nonlinear algebraic equations. Two methods for solving these equations are discussed and compared relative to computational efficiency. The design methodology is then illustrated via an application to an interconnected electric energy system."
"A new recursive procedure, based on state space techniques is presented to solve the restoration problem of images degraded by motion in one direction."
"A system and sensor configuration control problem has been formulated for a class of linear stochastic control systems corrupted by Gaussian noise. The criterion function is a weighted trace of the terminal error covariance matrix for the optimal linear estimator of the state of the system. A numerical optimization algorithm for this problem has been based on a parameter optimization approach. This approach is applied to a problem of optimal missile launcher control while estimating the relative alignment of two inertial instrument packages."
"Estimation of the state variables of a linear system with parameter uncertainties is performed using an asymtotically unbiased linear minimum-variance recursive estimator in continuous time. Estimates of the parameters can be obtained simultaneously, but are found to be biased. A linearized structure is formed for this nonlinear problem by augmenting additional linear dynamic equations which represent an asymtotic expansion in the unknown parameters. The convergence properties of the state variance for this expansion are illustrated analytically by a scalar state variable example. The numerical aspects of this example illustrate the behavior of the actual variance of the error in the state estimate and the predicted error variance as the order of the approximation increases. For the vector state problem, only the multidimensional dynamic system in canonical form with a single output is developed. For an n dimensional system with n unknown constant parameters, a first order approximation requires n additional linear equations. It is seen that this approach can be extended to correlated parameter processes."
"A criterion for characterizing an iteratively trained classifier is presented. The criterion is based on an information theoretic measure that is developed from modeling classifier training iterations as a set of cascaded channels. The criterion is formulated as a figure of merit and as a performance index to check the appropriateness of application of the characterized classifier to anunknown data base and for implementing classifier updates and data selection respectively."
"This paper presents modified formulations of the generalized least squares estimation algorithm for system parameter identification. Two sets of results are derived: First the existing algorithm is reformulated by eliminating the intermediate filtering procedures and introducing the system's input-output correlation matrices. Then it is shown that the new algorithm can be conveniently simplified to a form which does not require repeated matrix inversions."
"Nonlinear systems composed of linear dynamic subsystems in cascade with static power nonlinearities are considered. A structure theory is developed based on the representation of input/output behavior by rational functions in several variables. An algorithm is given which solves the minimal complete realization problem for two forms of the representation. A basis for identification of the representation from input/output experiments is also developed. Examples are worked in detail to illustrate the results."
"This study presents the conditions of applicability of stochastic approximation algorithms that minimize a mean-square error criterion for identification of a linear discrete-time stationary system without dynamical numerator. The acceleration of the convergence is discussed. Then a tentative is outlined to overcome the previous requirement of states accessibility."
"A global to local philosophy is presented as a methodology for cluster analysis. The global algorithm is presented as an estimator of initial cluster centers, while the local algorithm is presented as a refinement procedure of the global algorithm's estimate. Global-local techniques are discussed and experimental results are presented. This research was sponsored in part by NASA Grant NAS9-12931 and a UWM Graduate School Research Grant."
"One of the most important parameters in air-air guided missile performance is the navigation ratio. A technique for on-line estimation and control of the navigation ratio for a typical tactical, air-air guided missile is described."
"Digital fly-by-wire flight control systems are currently of interest because simple mechanical linkages are no longer able to cope with the many control problems associated with high performance aircraft. In view of this, a digital adaptive flight control algorithm has been developed by combining a weighted least squares estimator with optimal linear regulator control logic designed to minimize a quadratic model following performance index. Results for a typical fighter aircraft's trajectory over six distinct flight conditions are very promising."
"A technique for autonomously allocating control between an \"intelligent\" aiding system and a human operator is presented. A criteria function based on operator utilities and task related performance measures is used to adaptively optimize the allocation under changing operational conditions. The technique incorporates the following functions: (1) Adaptively estimate operator utilities; (2) Search for, and obtain, an optimum control allocation policy; (3) Adapt criteria function parameters to time variations in operational conditions."

 "To bridge the growing communications gap between meteorologists and engineers, a provisional list of definitions of terms frequently used by both groups is presented. These definitions are divided into four categories: A) Basic terminology (definitions of terms such as sensor, transducer, instrument, and data acquisition system). B) Terms relating primarily to the sensor (definitions of terms such as time constant, distance constant, damping ratio, and hysteresis). C) Terms relating primarily to the instrument (definitions of terms such as sensitivity, resolution, error, accuracy, and linearity). D) Terms relating primarily to the measuring process (definitions and discussions of terms such as precision, reliability, and representativeness). The authors hope this selected set of definitions will not only be of immediate use as a step towards a standard terminology but also will form the basis for a more comprehensive Glossary of Meteorological Instrumentation Terms."
"This paper outlines an American Meteorological Society-sponsored approach for developing a system of standard test procedures for the basic meteorological instruments. The approach involves establishing a number of working groups, under the direction of a suitable committee, composed of members from both industry and the profession. The approach is parallel to similar approaches successfully taken by other professional societies faced with similar problems."
"A standardized test for evaluation of meteorological measuring systems in the natural environment is described. The test is designed to provide a quantitative statistical value that will indicate the reliability of a particular system output. This quantity called functional precision provides a quantitative estimate of the difference in readings that can be expected from systems of identical design and construction when exposed to the same environmental conditions. The mathematical definition of this parameter is described and methods of application are discussed. Two specific examples are presented. A new surface sensor for measuring wind gust is compared with present observational practice and the functional precision determination for an upper air sounding system is summarized."
"The basic and readily observable meteorological variables are related to each other through partial differential equations in a fourdimensional space-time domain. With these one can compute unmeasured quantities, such as the vertical velocity and sea surface evaporation. Several estimates of the same derived quantity can be made by using several observation systems, such as a rawinsonde network, a fleet of aircraft, and instrumented ships. Intercomparison of the final results provide one measure of the error in the derived quantity. However, more extensive intercomparisons and cross-calibrations are required to understand the error content of each result in order to weight them before reaching a final conclusion, to avoid systematic errors or biases among the many observations taken by the component parts of any single observation system, and to substitute observations from one system in place of those deficient or missing from another system. In a future project, such as the GARP Atlantic Tropical Experiment, the international character of the effort and the desire to work on smaller space scales and shorter time intervals than in the Barbados Oceanographic and Meteorological Experiment (BOMEX) places especially stringent demands on the designed system accuracy and the intercomparisons necessary to ensure that, in fact, these demands have been met and preserved throughout the experiment."
"The Weather Service of the Federal Republic of Germany, along with several other national services, has responded to an international call for development of reference radiosondes. Such devices make use of sensing methods with a high degree of precision which are superior to any conventional upper-air sensing system. Reference radiosondes serve in quality control of conventional upper-air data by means of in situ comparisons. At the Instrument Division München, substantial progress has been made towards the development of sensing systems of a suitably high degree of accuracy. Temperature will be measured by means of a 15 μ platinum wire of 100 ohms resistance, operated in connection with a Wheatstone bridge. To measure humidity, the dry bulb -wet bulb temperature spread will be determined from a pair of bead thermistors, one of which will be coated by a film of water or ice while the other has a dry coating thick enough to produce a match in time constant of the two beads at the ice phase. Pressure will be determined at 180 points as an aneroid cell constantly expends to inake successive electrical contacts with a micrometer which retreats incrementally after each contact; an essential feature is that the aneroid cell carries no load."

"High quality magnetic field measurements in the auroral zone are particularly important in present studies of magnetospheric physics. The standard analog magnetometers are inappropriate because of limited dynamic range, sensitivity, and time resolution and inconveniences in the manipulation of the data. Remote observatories using satellite type magnetometers and digital data acquisition systems are therefore a desirable improvement. To complement the UCLA magnetometer on ATS-1, we have established a magnetic observatory near the ATS-1 conjugate point at Tungsten, N.W.T., Canada. The maintenance of this station and computer processing of the data have involved a number of unexpected problems which could delay similar efforts elsewhere. Therefore, the instrumentation and data processing for this observatory are described, with particular emphasis on outstanding problems. Alternatives to the use of digital incremental tape recorders as in the present system, e.g., data transmission via satellite link, are also discussed."
"Three geophysical methods of sensing and rapidly locating small voids or non-metallic artifacts in the top 50 cm of the soil, without physical contact, have been studied. The acoustic method employed a search head consisting of one to three loudspeakers, used C. W. either as sources or sensors at around 100 Hz, which were held within 5 to 25 cm of the surface. It apparently detected local variations in acoustic compliance. The electric resistivity method employed a field of alternating current injected into the ground outside the area to be searched, and a symmetrical-coil magnetic-gradient search head. Both methods utilized induced proximity effects which diminish rapidly with distance, but experiments indicated that they are capable of detecting nonmetallic objects buried as deeply as 25 cm in bare or grass-covered soil, without disturbing or touching the ground being searched. The thermal method employed a differential radiation detector operating at infrared wavelengths greater than 5 microns. It has detected localized thermal and moisture barriers under 12 cm of a uniform, bare soil, using the diurnal insolation cycle as an energy source."
"Two-dimensional recursive filters are useful only if stable, that is, if their outputs remain bounded for bounded inputs. The stability of a recursive filter depends on the phase spectrum of its denominator array. A two-dimensional generalization of the discrete Hilbert transform leads to a scheme producing stability with nominal distortions of the filter's desired amplitude spectrum. The method is therefore an attractive alternate to a least-squares procedure recently described by Shanks et al."
"The Fast Fourier Transform has been used to determine the reflection of a normally incident pulse from a three layered medium. The results show that the pulse reflection offers a diagnostic tool for obtaining information from stratified media. The detection of water layers in dry earth at depths up to approximately 10 meters or the measurement of ice thickness are specific examples."

"A theory of a three component heterogeneous dielectric has been developed to provide a basis for an analytic description of the electromagnetic properties of soil systems. The theory is valid for frequencies where the electromagnetic wavelength is much greater than the particle size. Essential parameters of the theory ase the amounts and properties of the separate constituents. Agreement between theory and experiment for low surface area sand systems at both audio and p-band radar frequencies is demonstrated."
"A procedure is developed to extract numerical features which characterize the pore structure of reservoir rocks. The procedure is based on a set of descriptors which give a statistical description of porous media. These features are evaluated from digitized photomicrographs of reservoir rocks and they characterize the rock grain structure in term of (1) the linear dependency of grey tones in the photomicrograph image, (2) the degree of \"homogeneity\" of the image and (3) the angular variations of the image grey tone dependencies. On the basis of these textural features, a simple identification rule using piecewise linear discriminant functions is developed for categorizing the photomicrograph images. The procedure was applied to a set of 243 distinct images comprising 6 distinct rock categories. The coefficients of the discriminant functions were obtained using 143 training samples. The remaining (100) samples were then processed, each sample being assigned to one of 6 possible sandstone categories. Eighty-nine per cent of the test samples were correctly identified."
"Direction finding techniques for determining the position on the surface directly above a small electromagnetic (loop) transmitter were tested at two hardrock mines and two coal mines in the fall of 1971. The actual locations of the underground transmitters in each case were projected to the surface using mine maps and conventional surveying techniques. A crossed loop direction finding receiver was developed to respond to the magnetic field. A null in the horizontal magnetic field was used to identify the surface location directly above the transmitter. Evaluation of this system at five locations in the four mines revealed location errors of 13 meters, 7 meters, 3 meters, 2 meters and 0. 5 meters respectively. Theoretical computations of magnetic field strengths based on transmitter frequency, ground conductivity and transmitter depth are shown along with measured profiles for two of the four mines visited. The effects of uniformly sloping terrain and dipole tilt are also examined theoretically and the results are shown to be consistent with the field measurements made under these conditions. Using known theoretical corrections for hill slope, it is shown that the measured source location can be improved to where it is within three meters of the actual location."
"With the aid of the least-square inverse-filtering theory, a simple minimum-phase criterion has been derived for sampled signals. The criterion provides the user with the number of zeros of the z-transform of the signal inside the unit circle (|z|<1). In addition, a measure of stability is proposed, showing how far the signal is remote from the (non) minimumphase property."
"An improved technique for obtaining stereo radar image pairs is described. The technique uses a unique combination of two different radar beam pattern characteristics. The resulting stereo radar images are illuminated from very nearly the same aircraft position which results in radar shadow and backscatter characteristics which are very similar and in improved image registration possibilities. The reduction in illumination angle and aircraft position differences is shown to be nearly an order of magnitude or more when compared with a previously proposed single flight technique which used two vertical fan beam patterns at different azimuth angles. As a related sidelight it is shown that this previous technique requlres the two fan beam patterns to generate parallax on the images and thus can not be implemented with synthetic arrays squinted at two different squint angles."

"This paper presents a generalized analysis for the dual-excited synchronous machine, in which, on the contrary of previous work, the two field windings are not necessary located on the rotor axes, and may not have the same number of turns or the same inclination angle to the physical axis of the pole structure. In deriving the general equation of the machine, no approximations are introduced other than those required for deriving Park's transformation, and so the analysis provides a more exact representation for this machine. Also a new per-unit system is applied, as the conventional one would introduce errors if the saliency is to be taken into consideration. The external connection is considered in a general form so as to allow for studying the machine performance when it is connected to an infinite-bus through a general transmission system. The small displacement model is derived and arranged in a form suitable for investigating dynamic stability problems. The model provides a good tool for studying the effect of using numerous schemes of excitation regulation on the dynamic behaviour of the machine."
"The per-unit systems used for the conventional synchronous machine are not equally applicable to the dual-excited one when the field windings are not located on the rotor axes. This is because the mutual inductances between any of the two inclined field windings and the armature windings are dependent on the permeance in both the direct and the quadrature-axis. In this paper, a sound per-unit system, taking this dependence into consideration, is suggested for this machine. The system is derived in such a way so as to provide normalized equations representing the physical nature of the magnetic couplings between the different machine circuits."
"This paper summarizes the results of a laboratory investigation on the RI and TVI performance of cap-and-pin insulator strings and single insulators, both clean and naturally or artificially polluted, in different ambient conditions (dry conditions, rain, fog, salt-fog)."
"The influence on switching surges of the lineasymmentry is analysed here by means of the Transient Network Analyzer (T. N. A.). Consideration is given to a 1050 kV line with two different source configurations causing different surge wave shapes. The influence on the results of possible different line simulations is focused and information is given on the number of operations necessary to get a consistent frequency distribution of overvoltages."
"The rapid convergence that Newton's method possesses, by use of the Jacobian matrix, has led to an investigation of using a higher order matrix, the Hessian, for an even faster convergence. It turns out that this approach unifies the fields of nonlinear programming methods and Newton based methods. The load flow problem can be defined as the solution of a system of simultaneous equations fI(x)= O, i= l, ..., n. It can be shown the Newton's method proceeds in a direction that minimizes F=∑fI(x)2. The Hessian load flow also minimizes F by assuming that it is a quadratic function, such that the linearizations become HΔx=-g, where the Hessian H is the matrix of the second partials of F and the vector g is the gradient of F. The optimal load flow problem can be formulated by including some additional terms in F so that a single algorithm, based on the Hessian, essentially solves both the normal and the optimal load flow problems. An interesting aspect of the method is that an existing Newton's program can be updated to a Hessian program quite simply. The H matrix is somewhat less sparse than the corresponding Jacobian but enough so that sparse techniques should be used. Furthermore, the Hessian can be completely obtained from the Jacobian, thus avoiding extra explicit function evaluations in the program. The paper presents enough details of the method for an implementation of a computer program. Numerical examples are given and compared with Newton's method results."

A review is provided of the theoretical solutions to the fade problems and the success of applying these solutions in the field to reduce outage time caused by path fading. This presentation is made on the basis that others who have similar tasks in providing microwave systems with better than 99.992% reliability can benefit from our experience."
"A series of staged power-fault tests was conducted by the U. S. Bureau of Reclamation with the Bell System participating. One of the main purposes of these tests was to observe the effects of power-system disturbances on leased audio-tone relaying channels. Interference on these circuits was minimized by using bifilar-wound loading coils to avoid signal modulation effects; high-potential testing of telephone cable facilities ensured adequate dielectric strength. In addition, a communication-facility electrical protection system was installed which employed longitudinal drainage that was applied as needed to mitigate 60-Hz potentials introduced into the telephone plant."
"A model of a single steam turbine generator is developed which includes the effects of random load fluctuations observed in interconnected power systems. This model is used in the design of an on-line state estimator for an individual generator. A digital simulation of the generator model and state estimator indicates the state estimation procedure is feasible and can be implemented on a small control computer."
"The ammeter described in this paper is essentially a resistor with a variable cross section and a reversible temperature indicator. It has a foil cut into the shape of a double taper with the narrow ends joined at the center of the foil. Current flow through the foil causes a temperature gradient with the higher temperatures in the center. Liquid crystal material coated on the foil substrate changes color reversibly over a discrete range. A narrow color band forms and moves on the taper. The location of the color band is shown to be linearly proportional to the rms current passing through the foil. With the use of irreversible temperature sensing materials, this device will record the peak rms current. The analysis, experimental verification, and design data are presented. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of this ammeter are described."
"Utilization of the earth's geothermal energy resources for production of electric power has been achieved in several areas throughout the world. The only commercial development in operation in North America is at \"The Geysers\" north of San Francisco. A 12 MW unit commenced operation in 1960, and additional units have been added bringing the total capacity to 192 MW. Design and construction now under way will increase this to 522 MW by the end of 1974. There are plans for continuing increments of approximately 100 MW per year as steam reserves are developed. The steam supply, mechanical and electrical features, operating experience, and special problems are described."

Design features and development of the relay, and results from tests conducted at a typical reactor installation are presented. The relay demonstrated successful detection of simulated layer-to-layer reactor faults in about one cycle and sufficient immunity to false operation during the test series to be left in service for further evaluation. A comparison between the conventional reactor protection and that afforded by the new relay is illustrated."
"A solid-state power rate relay to aid system preservation has been developed by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. The device is sensitive to a preselected combination of magnitude, direction of flow, and rate of change of power. Depending on application requirements, the relay may be used alone or in combination with acceleration relays to sense conditions which threaten system integrity and to initiate the appropriate action to maintain system stability."
"Measurement of transient potentials in substation yards on control circuits, CTs, CPTs, 115 vac receptacles, howlers, yard telephones, heaters, flood lights and cable lead sheaths during disconnect switch arcing require more stringent instrumentation techniques than comparable measurements made in the control house. Methods and equipment have been devised to trigger oscilloscopes independent of recorded transient and reduce measuring circuit interference voltages."
"Resistance dividers, capacitance dividers, shunts, termination resistors, and multi-coupling devices have been developed to use with triaxial cable during EMI, LVI, and transient potential measurements. Arcing disconnects switches - back-to-back switching of shunt capacitor produce EMI voltages, intercept potential on fences and ground mat potential rise. Circuits used to measure these voltages and a method to measure ground mat surge impedance is summarized in this report."

"The appropriate form of the Poisson equation, for a region that is anisotropic and continuously inhomogeneous, is derived. A practical example is furnished by the axially laminated anisotropic rotor of a reluctance machine. A functional is presented which is made stationary by the solution of the Poisson equation under natural Dirichlet, mixed, and Neumann boundary conditions. Because of anisotropy, the latter two boundary conditions involve B rather than ∂ϕ/∂n . The finite element scheme caters for curves along which the boundary condition may vary continuously. Results presented include air gap flux and magnetic potential plots for both the direct and quadrature-axis positions."
"Practical techniques have been established for the seismic testing of Class I instrumentation for Nuclear Power Plants which meet the requirements of IEEE-JCNPS/SC2.5 without placing an unreasonable burden on the utility customer costwise or delivery wise. Test method details and results from the application of these techniques are discussed."
"The purpose of this paper is to present results of energy production cost calculations made for three sample power systems using a new, probabilistic technique which computes the statistical, expected value of the energy cost. These results demonstrate the importance of the effect of forced outages on expected, future power system energy costs. Unscheduled unit outages may increase calculated production costs by 2 to 5 percent. The calculations yield both expected cost values and loss-of-energy power system reliability measures and will provide information on the energy and power demand expected to be required for emergencies. These data are useful for system design. The paper illustrates the effect of the size of the available generating reserve on the system's probable loss-of-energy and expected production costs."
"Stabilization of a synchronous machine through the control of its exciotation is discussed in this paper. The control laws are derived from the linearized equation of performance of the synchronous machine by the minimization of a scalar performance index. The manipulated variable is an increment to the exciter reference voltage having an amplitude constraint. Control laws are dependent on the selection of the weighting coefficients of the states and the input. Guidelines are given for the selection of these coefficients so that both the small signal dynamic performance and the large signal transient performance of the machine are improved. It is shown that suboptimal controls corresponding to the feedback of machine slip velocity and its derivatives produce substantial improvement of machine response. Different transient conditions are simulated on the nonlinear machine model and the extent of improvement of machine performance by using the proposed control laws is demonstrated."
"This paper describes the results of studies made to improve the dynamic response and damping torques of power systems incorporating synchronous machines with 2-axis excitation control. Dynamic optimization techniques have been used to determine the optimum controls subject to a quadratic integral performance index. The system has been simulated as a seventh order, closed loop, non-linear model incorporating speed governor and voltage and angle regulators. Modified quasilinearization and first order gradient methods have been utilized for solving the optimization problems for this non-linear system. The investigations indicate that optimal control of doubly excited synchronous machines is possible and that it yield, s improved transient performance. Incidentally, some possible limitations of the quasilinearization technique have also been brought out."
"The concept of transfer function can be easily extended to rotating machines if Laplace transform is applied to generalized vector equations. The solutions are directly available, are rigorous and are very easy to handle. The only restriction imposed is linearity, by virtue of the Laplace transform. Classical concepts like transient and subtransient reactances and time constants can be precisely defined. Two results are of immediate practical value: during disturbances the ac current components will deviate from 60 Hz, even if the rotors of synchronous machines maintain their speed, affecting the operation of frequency relays; an inexpensive analog model can be developed some 100,000 times faster than the 60 Hz real time frame."
"Historically in North America, partial discharge or corona measurements in MV have been used for transformer quality control and customer acceptance, but in the future it is anticipated the pC unit may also be used."
"Virtually all hydraulic generating units installed in Ontario Hydro since 1964 have been equipped with static excitation systems, necessitating supplementary stabilizing signals to suppress power oscillations. This paper reviews the experience gained with alternative types of stabilizing systems at these stations and discusses advantages and disadvantages of each, problems in meeting accuracy requirements, permissible levels of noise content in the signals and the problems in application of stabilizing signals to thermal machines."
"Torsionalvibrations have been observed on large thermal units with both static exciters, and stabilizing signals based on shaft speed measurement. Studies of transfer functions of round rotor machines and mechanical modes of torsional oscillation of a 500 MW turbo-generator, have led to a solution based on derivation of the stabilizing signal from a speed measurement close to the node of the first torsional mode. New arrangements have been designed and installed on four units now in service."
"Currently 1300 MW machines are being installed in power plants and 1500 and 2000 MW machines are a distinct possibility. Consequently isolated phase bus in power plants has to carry continuous currents as high as 40,000 amps or more. In this paper the results of tests conducted under laboratory conditions up to 36,000 amps is analyzed and discussed. An empirical approach for determining time-temperature behavior under emergency conditions, such as failure of cooling equipment, is suggested. The detailed design of a forced cooling system for isolated phase bus is discussed."

Steady-state equivalent circuit models are developed for both the synchronous and sub-synchronous modes of operation. A comprehensive analysis of rotor parasitic loss components and stator saturation effects is made and these are represented by suitable parameters in the general equivalent circuit models. Reasonably close agreement between the measured and calculated terminal quantities is obtained."
"New generation capacity is not keeping up with load growth. Heavier interconnections are of little value if the needed capacity does not exist. The reports on the Great Northeast Blackout urged the industry to build more ties, reduce the component failure rate and the frequency of outages, and make plants so that they could be restarted without bringing in outside power."
"This paper presents an easy-to-use method for evaluation of energy from power plants with different output and cost characteristics. The approach described takes into account the suitability of stations for covering a certain demand pattern. It is based on the comparison of generation cost of the power station in question to the cost of generating energy with constant power, expressed by a value factor, and an analysis of the demand arranged to certain groups of daily utilization hours. It permits an easy qualitative evaluation of the effect of different types of station on the development of overall generation costs."
"The effect of the power plant time response on the closed loop roots of an optimum load frequency control system which minimizes the integral square error of control action, economic error, area control error, and the integral of area control error was obtained using root square locus techniques. A maximum value of 30 seconds for the first order plant time constant was estimated by considering rate limiting and bandwidth reduction effects."
"Meeting requirements for seismic capabilities in electric equipment installed in nuclearpower generating stations requires a working relationshipwith an esoteric and complex technology.

Basic requirements are explained, followed by more detailed discussions of methods of qualification and application of specific types of equipment."
"In the last decade great progress has been made in the area of optimal control and system optimization. In this paper, optimal control theoretic approach to the design of controllers for a synchronous machine is attempted to improve the dynamic response of the power system. An accurate linearised state space model of a single machine system is derived for which an optimal output feedback regulator is obtained. Both finite and infinite time regulator problems are considered. The superiority in the performance of the system with optimal output feedback controller compared to that of a conventional regulator is conclusively established."
"This paper concerns a real-time control scheme of voltage and reactive power in power systems when more than two control computers as well as one central coordinating computer are involved. When a large number of voltage and/or reactive power regulating devices are involved in a power system and the number of nodes or lines in which the voltages or reactive power flows are observed and controlled increases, the necessary computing time and memory requirement increase exponentially if the central computer installed at the central dispatching office should take care of all control functions. In addition, the number of channels of the data transmission network becomes very large because the voltage and reactive power flow at each electric station must be transmitted to the central computer and the optimum operating values of regulating devices should be transmitted back to the regulating stations."
"The capacitive power, which a properly regulated conventional synchronous machine can supply is severly limited at no load as well as at light loading. Such a machine, when operating at these loading conditions, cannot be fully utilized. In this paper, it will be shown that these limitations can be overcome by the dual-excitation of the synchronous machine. Such a dual-excited synchronous machine, when provided with appropriate schemes of excitation control, has extended dynamic stable region at any loading condition. Two modes of operation are found possible in this case. In the first, the two field windings are always equally excited, while in the second their excitation currents are adjusted so as to keep the rotor-angle fixed at a certain value independent of the loading condition. Although the first mode of operation is of advantage from the rotor heating point of view, it suffers from the drawback that the sign of the control signal for stable operation depends on the operating condition. To overcome this drawback, the second mode of operation is suggested. With this mode, the dynamic stability of the machine can be greatly improved over the whole loading range. However, since fixing the rotor-angle at a certain value necessitates unequal excitation currents in the two field windings, this mode of operation would result in unbalanced distribution of rotor heating."
"An experimental modelling technique of a grounding electrode in non-homogenous soil is presented, and the experimental results obtained are compared with theoretical figures computed from known analytical methods.(1,2) This technique is suitable for dc or ac testing of a grounding electrode. A description of the physical model is given, and the choice of the model parameters discussed."
"The capital costs incurred in the provision of power circuits through underground tunnels is such as to make further efforts in the refinement of thermal rating computations worth while. In the present work steady state and transient temperature calculations are performed via thermal network models of the system. Heat transfer by radiation is separately accounted for and heat transfer by free or forced convection determined by means of new empirical formulae established experimentally on groups of cables."
"The paper describes a mathematical model for calculating electrical resistance and inductance of a conductor of any form (ground included), by taking into account the actual distribution of current inside its section."
"Communications systems are often used for transmission of control signals where the possibility of false outputs must be minimized. To minimize erroneous system outputs, special design considerations are involved."
"Switching of series capacitors to improve system stability is of current interest. Investigations indicate that modern control theory might be applied to determine switching of a combination of series capacitors so that the system may be transferred from one state to another in minimum time and in a nonoscillatory manner. In these studies, a simplified voltage-reactance equivalent of the one-machine infinite bus system was used. The material presented in this paper shows that this simplified model does not predict the performance of a one-machine infinite bus system with the accuracy necessary to determine the capacitor switching times so as to achieve the control objectives. However, it is shown that computation accuracy may be improved by including system losses. It appears that in order to apply optimal control techniques it will be necessary to develop more accurate models of the power system components. Also, faster than real time iterative, on-line, computation techniques as simulatedc in this paper should be implemented and used to calculate the switching times. Until these obstacles are overcome, optimal control theory will have little impact upon the power industry."

"A relation is derived for the magnetic energy storage of a synchronous machine as a function of machine reactances, excitation and terminal voltages. The stored magnetic energy may be represented in terms of a per-unit magnetic energy parameter, having the dimension of seconds, analogous to the representation of stored kinetic energy in terms of the per-unit inertia constant, H. It is found that for most conventional synchronous machines, operating at 60 Hz, the magnitude of the stored magnetic energy is about three decimal orders of magnitude less than the stored kinetic energy."
"Performance tests were conducted on nuclear service diesel electric generating sets to verify their capability, to start a number of times without outside power available, to accept and reject loads, to accept loads after prolonged no load operation and to operate for a period of time with no external cooling available."
"The problem of optimum scheduling of hydro-thermal power systems is considered. A functional analytic optimization technique is applied to a general system. The power system considered contains (n-m) hydro-plants on the same stream. The time delay of the flow between upstream and downstream plants is taken into consideration. This is an extension of the results reported in [1]. Optimal solutions to some special cases of this problem are given and shown to agree with results obtained earlier using other techniques. The resulting optimal schedule can be easily incorporated in existing economy dispatch program that neglect the hydraulic coupling."
"A method is presented which calculates approximately the electrical torque in synchronous machine at multi-phase reclosing, neglecting subtransient saliency and electrical decrements. A new digital simulation program, with some examples of digital calculations, is presented in detail which is used to analyze the transient phenomena accompanying power swings at multi-phase reclosing, after multi open conductors following the fault."
"Minimum protection, interlocking and control of a fossil fuel unit connected steam station requires accurate sensing of the process variables, and coordinated interlocked tripping to prevent or minimize damage to the process. Equally important in preventive protection is logical sequences for starting and stopping the unit, containing interlocks and/or operating instructions to enforce the correct procedures.

"This paper describes mathematical models of varying complexity for the digital computation of transient behaviour of generators and motors in a synchronous power system, and their application in the light of extensive studies which have been made on a model power system. The computed and measured responses to transient disturbances are compared and the representation of terms in the equations which substantially affect behaviour is discussed."
"This paper evaluates the application of bang-bang switching to the control of the system impedance presented to the generator, and proceeds to the evaluation of a similar form of control applied to excitation voltage. The general theory is explained, and both applications are supported by digital studies and experiments on a model power system. Attention is paid to the correlation between computed and measured responses and to the effects of erroneous switching times."
"The application of probability methods to the spinning reserve area has been illustrated in several recent publications. This material has included the effects of unit deratings1, peaking and hot reserve equipment2 and the benefits associated with interconnected systems3. In the latter case, the effects of load forecast uncertainty and the consideration of unit derating levels were included in the two system interconnection studies. Results were shown for the Saskatchewan and Manitoba Power Systems3. This paper also presented a general approach to interconnection studies in which the assisting system is represented by an equivalent multi-level assistance unit. This equivalent reflects the units in operation and the available reserve in the assisting system and the existing transfer capability between the two systems. The transfer capability may not be a constant value as is normally used in system planning studies but may vary with system conditions."
"For a more accurate load analysis of the Homopolar Inductor Alternator (HIA), a magnetic vector potential analysis must be used which considers the nonlinearities of the iron and the actual current density fields. A nonlinear quasi-Poissonian partial differential equation, subject to the appropriate boundary conditions, is defined to solve for the vector potential in the middle cross section of the alternator. The partial differential equation and boundary conditions are transformed into a set of partial difference equations which are solved numerically by a successive line-overrelaxation method. The magnetic induction, flux distribution and volt-ampere characteristic are obtained for a 95 KVA, 208/115 V, 3400 Hz experimental alternator."
"For three phase shunt reactors to function effectively in EHV power systems the behavior of the circuit reluctance must be known under all operating conditions. Difficulties have occurred in effectively designing electromagnetic circuits with multiple air gaps in shunt reactors. This paper describes design techniques for magnetic shunts which can be applied to three phase shunt reactors resulting in size and weight reduction. Performance characteristics of shunt reactors under imbalanced system conditions are presented and magnetic shunt performance for a 345 kV, 100 MVAR three phase shunt reactor is given."
"The IEEE Working Group on Power Plant Response has been in existence under the joint sponsorship of three IEEE Subcommittees. These subcommittees are the Power Plant Controls Protection and Automation Subcommittee of the Power Generation Committee, the System Controls Subcommittee and Systems Operations Subcommittee of the Systems Engineering Committee. The purpose of the Working Group is to study the subject of power plant MW response characteristics in the context of their role in meeting normal load changes."
"A computer model and small disturbance response of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Valley Steam Plant is reported. Operating equipment tests determined the generator voltage regulator computer model. The generator voltage regulator computer model is tested with and without supplementary control under various loading conditions. On-line test of the Valley Steam Plant verified the operating deficiencies indicated by the computer model. Supplementary excitation control was found to have a beneficial effect on intertied network operation, but may be detrimental with certain network configurations."
"This paper summarizes a research effort investigating the effects of geomagnetic storms on electric power systems. Geomagnetic storms, which are caused by solar flares, can cause spurious quasi-dc currents in power systems; these are termed solar-induced-currents (SIC). A summary of SIC data recorded on over 30 power systems across the United States is presented, and power system effects are discussed. The important problem of internal localized heating in power transformers due to SIC is presented, as well as a consideration of possible methods of mitigation of the SIC."
"Computer applications in power systems have tended to evolve at the supervisory levels in system operation. Controls at the generation levels remain primarily an analog domain. To make the entire system operation flexible it is essential that the control devices be compatible. This points towards the application of computers as dedicated direct digital controllers at the primary control levels. This paper describes the development of an integrated and compatible scheme for complete digital control of a generating unit. The overall concept and details of a physical model being built to test the proposed control scheme are given."
"The hysteresis losses inherent in the conventional high voltage pipe-type cable system can be avoided by the use of non-magnetic pipe. A new system is proposed consisting of single-phase cables in filament-wound epoxybonded fiberglass covered aluminum pipes. Investigation indicates the proposed system to be practicable, economically sound, and to offer a reasonable and feasible method of increasing the load capability of pipe-type cables."
"In view of the fact that installation costs may represent up to half the investment in an underground cable system, it is desirable to develop concepts for superconducting cables which, from the beginning, promise to keep this expense to a minimum. Superconducting cable will be very light and, providing it is flexible, the cable should be capable of being pulled in long lengths. Two concepts for flexible superconducting cables are presented together with a discussion of expected performance in the system."
"To apply cross-linked polyethylene for EHV cable insulation, several cables are designed, and manufactured and their characteristics are measured. By manufacturing, normal cross-linked polyethylene are used for comparison together with special cross-linked polyethylene insulations which have been newly developed. It is found that non-carbon filled and voltage-stabilized insulations possess excellent properties in corona and treeing deterioration resistance, and electrical breakdown strength which indicate the possibility of application these cables to real service. Problems and aspects of plastic-insulated power cables for higher voltage grades, such as 275kV class, are discussed."
"In recent years, a number of research projects have been initiated to study the application of unconventional technologies to extend the capacity of underground power transmission systems. General Electric Corporate Research and Development has recently completed a three-year study of resistive cryogenic cable systems. This study was sponsored by the Edison Electric Institute, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the American Public Power Association. The results of this research indicate that the application of cryogenic technology to the development of high-capacity underground transmission systems is within the scope of current technology, and should be economically competitive at single-circuit capacities over 3000 MVA."
"Future transmission systems will handle larger blocks of power and a greater percentage will be installed underground. Solutions to the present limitations on operating such systems are being developed and it is anticipated that the economies of size will reduce the competitive disadvantage. It is important that continued effort be directed in this field so that the necessary systems are developed."
"Previous papers have shown how to design a phase transformer winding component, of order (n,k), to link any sequence component of order g of the n-phase system with any sequence component order f of the k-phase system. For a (7,5) phase transformer this means there may be up to 35 such distinct components of the winding matrix."
"A device employing an ion chamber has been developed for the sensitive, reliable, and very rapid detection of local ovetheatingin a gas-cooled electric machine before extensive damage can result. The device detects the presence of pyrolysis products generated by the thermal decomposition of organic materials such as insulations and polymers. The pyrolysis products include particles of the size of condensation nuclei (about 0.001 to 0.1 microns), and smaller, which have such a pronounced effect on the ion current in the ion chamber that a definite signal is obtained from a hot spot as small as one square inch in area in a large hydrogen-cooled generator. A considerable amount of test and operating experience has been acquired."
"This paper presents theoretical equations, describing the relations between the performance and design details of a three phase salient pole type generator with simultaneous AC and DC output, the latter being obtained by bridge rectification. The AC voltage is regulated and the DC voltage floats; however, the inverse condition is also included. The start and duration of DC commutation, all damper and field winding currents, the DC commutation current and both average, RMS and instantaneous DC and AC voltages are determined."
"The equations derived in Part I of this paper are applied numerically to an actual generator design. The results are shown in performance curves, demonstrating the relations between AC and DC loading and the angle of start of commutation, commutation duration, the average field current, the internal generator angle and the RMS, average and instantaneous AC and DC voltages. Also, the influence of DC commutation and the relative spacing between the AC and DC stator windings upon the deformation of the AC voltage is shown."
"The general problem of which insulator configuration is best for gas-insulated systems is considered. A smooth disc is compared with both a corrugated disc and a cone and the cone is seen to have considerable potential. Impulse and switching surge voltages are more severe than 60 Hz when contamination is present on the insulators. When insulators are contaminated, the dielectric strength cannot be increased by increasing pressure."
"In this paper mode of operation of multiple-input moving-coil relay with fully rectified inputs, transistor block average phase comparator and rectifier bridge amplitude comparator are analysed. Methods for obtaining special threshold characteristics of elliptical, hyperbolic, etc. form and composite threshold characteristics formed by the intersection of straight lines, circles, etc. are shown and examples given. In each case the inherent dynamic performance of the relay, in relation to power system conditions, is determined in order to see its suitability for application."
"A study was made of the accuracy of utility power system stability simulations, as affected by the complexity of the synchronous generator models and the data used with the models. The investigation was performed by simulating the operation of a representative multimachine power system with many combinations of disturbance, initial load, system stiffness, model detail and model data. The findings from this study provide guidelines for the selection of the simplest computational machine models for use in large scale stability analyses, with the goal of minimizing the cost of computer usage while assuring sufficient accuracy of the results. Recommendations are made for selecting machine data more suitable for use in stability studies than the standard machine data."
"The method of finding flux plots in the cross section of salient pole rotating machines is extended to large, internally cooled turbogenerators. The relaxation procedure used by the authors in former papers [1,2,3] is assumed to be known to the reader and is not reviewed here. The grid systems for the partial differential equations are described in detail for a Westinghouse Electric Corp. 200 MVA, 15 kV, wye-connected, four-pole, 1,500 r/min, 50 Hz generator. Flux plots in the cross section of the alternator and the distribution of the radial magnetic induction on the stator bore are determined at no-load, three-phase short circuit, and at balanced lagging and leading loads. Available test data compare well with calculated results."
"The method in Ref. [1] is used to determine synchronous reactances for the turbogenerator at operating conditions in Part I [2]. The influence of saturation on the direct and quadrature reactances is studied and the difficulties caused by linear parameters in nonlinear theory are discussed. A modified phasor-diagram taking the small angles dγ and γq into account is developed. The results are given for a Westinghouse Electric Corp. 200 MVA, 15 kV, wye-connected, four-pole, 50 Hz generator. Available test data are compared with computations."
"Justification for using more realistic load models in stability studies than has been the practice heretofore is presented below. Examples are given which show that stability tests may be dramatically affected by load-voltage characteristics, or that more sophisticated models are necessary under conditions which preclude the usual composite load assumptions. In conclusion the paper states that system measurements are the most practical means of obtaining realistic load-voltage data for use in computer stability programs."
"The determination of power system network topology for off-line studies is a relatively simple problem since one-line diagrams inherently describe system configuration. In real time environments, system configuration is dynamic. Breakers may operate at any time producing some of the following effects: 1) circuits may or may not be disconnected, 2) substations may or may not separate possibly forming new nodes, thus varying the total number of nodes in a system, and 3) an interconnected system may split into several separated areas. Unless provisions are made to automatically incorporate in real time the effects of breaker operations on system topology, any calculation and decision based on a wrong configuration would be dangerous, especially when most needed: immediately after the occurrence of the abnormality ity which lead to breaker operations."
"A critical step in the efficient use of piecewise solution techniques is the network decomposition1. This paper presents a completely automatic decomposition algorithm for power system networks. The criterion for decomposition is to minimize the total storage requirement while complying with the specified upper limit of nodes per subdivision."
"The paper describes a novel method for polyphase ground fault relaying with the help of a simple coincidence principle of the selected input quantities. The general principle of operation, actual design and performance results have been discussed. The relay operates correctly for all single line to ground faults, as well as double line to ground faults with the same reach in each case. For line to line faults and 3-phase faults the relay remains completely inoperative. Like other reported relays of the same category it has the advantages of insensitivity towards balanced overload and power swings in the transmission line. Moreover it has greater tolerance for arcing faults and is less susceptible to transient over-reach or maloperation due to other spurious signals. The relay is also completely directional in nature."
"This paper discusses continuing activity, since that reported by us two years ago,1 on the certifiable simulation of a seismic event applied to Class IE electrical equipment.

It provides sufficient mathematical background, application data for relative evaluation, and test data supporting the usage of the selected input signal."
"Optimum scheduling of generation subject to constraints on maximum and minimum levels and rates of change of generation, spare capacity and line flow limits, is studied. A linear programming formulation for system constraints is used with a quadratic cost function for generation and transmission line loss. An optimal solution for real power dispatch is obtained by quadratic programming, and optimum allocation of reactive power is based on a gradient technique which minimises transmission loss subject to nodal voltage and reactive power limits. An ac load flow analysis is incorporated together with a load prediction program based on a spectral analysis of past load data. The feasibility of simulating the overall system problem, including load-frequency control of equivalent generation, using a combined analogue-digital process computer system linked to a large scientific digital computer by data link is investigated."
"AC current transformers used in HVDC applications are analyzed. Their behaviour is studied and the requirements necessary for accurate operation noted.

"A crossed field (Penning) discharge device has been developed which can perform HVDC interruption. The discharge is controlled by a magnetic field, the removal of which causes the plasma to decay in a time ~10μs. The present single tube capability is 100 kV/2000 A with a recovery rate of 2 kV/μs. The tubes are capable of series and parallel operation, opening the door to many HVDC applications requiring forced current interruption at performance levels far in excess of those of a single tube."

Examples of simulations are included."
"Previous tearing algorithms have considered the interconnections in a power system at two levels, 1) the subdivision level for recognizing the interconnections within the subdivisions and 2) the inter-subdivision level for recognizing the interconnections of the subdivisions themselves. The present paper will generalize the previous work from two levels to any number of computing levels. The initial application of this work is for implementing certain change cases in two-level piecewise programs by additions in levels rather than by changing existing network models."
"A double circuit HVDC transmission linie equipped with a factacting dc circuit breaker has been studied in three modes of switching. Load breaking in one line and transfer to the other was investigated by utilizing an HVDC system simulator; breaker duty was easy and system disturbances were minimal. Fault clearing with and without system control assistance was investigated by use of a digital computer; breaker duty was more severe when control assistance was not utilized, but the duration of the system disturbance was reduced. No unacceptable system or breaker overvoltages were observed. The digital computer program was comprehensive, in that it modeled not only the line and terminal configurations but also the dynamic control characteristics of the Pacific Intertie."

"The question of possible limits of HVDC power supplied to an a.c. system is discussed on a general basis. This limit will be of interest, if a.c. systems are to be reinforced without increasing their short circuit capacity. The two important aspects, i.e. power frequency and harmonic phenomena are discussed in view of investigations on single HVDC converters published earlier by other authors. The results are extended to multiple infeed. It is shown that in contradiction to the general opinion at present, the short circuit ratio presents no limit to the rating of a single converter station, that for multiple infeed each station can be dealt with separately with regard to its rating and that increasing the number of inverter stations connected to the same system does not increase the danger of harmonic instability."
"Results of extensive studies show the ultimate power capabilities of high-pressure, oil-filled, pipe-type cable systems. Both self-cooled systems and systems utilizing forced-cooling to control shield temperatures are evaluated. Limiting mechanical factors are discussed together with the effects cable and system parameters have on the maximum power rating. Ratings exceeding 1000 MVA appear possible for self-cooled systems and ratings for forced-cooled systems can exceed 2000 MVA."
"There has been considerable work done in the past few years on the development and analysis of reliability models for power system components, subsystems and systems1. The most well known models are probably those which have evolved in the development of reliability techniques in the capacity planning area. The basic concepts of state probabilities and the frequencies associated with state encounters have also been successfully applied in subsystem and integrated system aanalysis2,3. State transition diagrams have been utilized to analyze the benefits or penalties associated with different step-up transformer arrangements for a large generating unit4. The modelling techniques illustrated in these applications are not vastly different and the solutions were obtained by considering the system as a conventional Markov process."
"Induction machine instability is predicted on the basis of equivalent circuits. The circuits are derived assuming sinusoidal perturbation of the rotor speed. Classic rotating field concept is used in the analysis. It is shown that equivalent estimates of the critical supply frequencies, at which instability occurs is obtained by the method shown in the paper and conventional eigenvalue analysis. Approximate, conservative analytical expressions are also obtained by using certain simplifying assumptions. It is possible to obtain the sensitivity of the instability region to different machine parameters. This indicates the parameter which has the greatest influence on stabilizing the machine. The approach developed may be extended to study the effect of time harmonics on the stability of induction machines."
"Integral equations are shown to offer definite advantages over conventional finite difference techniques for solving magnetic field problems. In Part I of this paper two models are presented to account for the presence of a ferromagnetic medium. In the first model the magnetic material is replaced by an equivalent dipole distribution which gives rise to an integral equation for the scalar potential. The model is limited to problems involving nonmagnetic current carrying conductors. The second model uses a current distribution to represent the magnetic material. Therefore, it is not subject to the restrictions of the dipole model. Numerical solution of the resulting integral equation in both models is discussed. The technique offers considerable flexibility in the choice of the mesh size and shape. Also, geometries involving narrow air gaps and/or sharp corners are easily accommodated."
"An integral equation formulation for the mathematical modelling of ferromagnetic materials is obtained in terms of magnetization vectors for solving three-dimensional magnetic field problems. This approach offers some computational advantages in achieving a numerical solution, so far as computing efforts and storage are concerned.

The system of equations converges very rapidly for rectangular geometries."

  "A computer model is used to demonstrate the turnon stresses of thyristors connected in series and for paralleled thyristor strings within a HVdc valve. The performance of parallel strings is compared with single strings of directly paralleled thyristors. The use of inductors in the strings is considered, and the possible benefits of controlling relative gating instants of the thyristors are analysed."
"The influence of conducting particles on the ac breakdown of compressed SF6 has been investigated for two coaxial systems having inner electrodes of diameter 75 mm and 150 mm and a 250 mm diameter outer electrode, using voltages up to 450 kV rms at pressures up to 1.8 MNm-2 (18 atm.). For filamentary particles of 0.1 mm or 0.4 mm diameter wire, there was a maximum breakdown voltage at 0.4 MNm-2 (4 atm.) which became more pronounced with increasing particle length and decreasing particle diameter. No maximum was observed with spherical particles but for each system there was a critical sphere size which gave the lowest breakdown voltage at a given pressure. There was also a slight density effect at the lower pressures, aluminum spheres producing lower breakdown voltages than spheres of brass or steel. Tests with wires and spheres fixed to the inner conductor, to simulate breakdown initiated by field enhancement at particles migrating to the inner, gave ac and impulse results which differed from the free-particle ac breakdown voltages. Calculations have been made of the motion of spherical particles and of the energy in microdischarges at the electrodes; the particles can make excursions lasting several cycles and this may be important in creating optimum conditions for breakdown."
"A new approach of characterizing the breakdown properties of insulation under switching surges is presented. The probabilistic aspects of the actual disruptive voltage and the time to breakdown are combined in one analytical function, the breakdown bivariate probability density distribution. The paper uses this novel concept to offer some useful suggestions to the design of insulation."
"A pole-to-pole short-circuit of a HVdc converter with two bridges in cascade is analyzed. The effect of a common source reactance and blocking of valves are also considered. The computed current waveforms indicate approximately the same levels of peak current as obtlined previously for short-circuits of a single bridge. The interaction of the commutating reactances is found to be marginally significant."

The influence of circuit resistance on the bus voltage patterns is reviewed."
"A new technique has been developed for analyzing switching transients on distributed power systems that is based on the principle of superposition. The main advantage of the new technique is in economy of computer execution time. A linear system must be assumed but frequency dependent parameters which result in multi-velocity waves can be included. The program that is based on the new technique utilizes step responses, that can be computed using existing programs or analog devices, to compute the desired transient responses. Because of the economy of the technique it is well suited for use in determining either the maximum transient voltage or the statistical distribution of peak transient voltages. The technique has been verified on both single-and three-phase test systems."

The models have been used to study power system hunting or dynamic stability, first swing or transient stability, load rejection overvoltages, resynchronization of cross-compound turbine-generator sets, field current and voltage during out-of-step operation, voltage dip and other phenomena associated with machine operation on power systems. The paper reviews some of the experience obtained in system studies and in comparisons between test results and computer simulations."

"This paper describes the results of investigation into the performance of suspension type insulators for HVDC transmission line under polluted condition. Shed profile plays a big role in determining DC withstand voltage value. The withstand voltage value for DC is lower than that for AC rms, and the higher the deposit density is, the smaller becomes the atio of the DC value to the AC."
"The short-term real and reactive power optimization of a large system is a non-linear programming problem and its solution requires a considerable amount of computational effort. In actual practice separate real and reactive power suboptimization techniques may be more suitable than a complete optimization(1). The results obtained by the suboptimal techniques under ideal conditions coincide with those from a real and reactive power optimization. In this paper, complete real and reactive optimization has been solved by suboptimization techniques. The proposed approach decomposes the complete problem into two halves, i. e. the optimum voltage evaluation and the real power optimization with optimally determined voltages. A theoretical treatment of the technique along with a qualitative and analytical discussion is provided. The method is applied to a small system and the results obtained are compared with a real and reactive power optimization."

"Experimental measurements of dielectric recovery following 400 *#x003BC;sec duration square current pulses of 350 A and 1000 A have been conducted on ten nozzle configurations with upstream and downstream pressures of 4 atm. and 1 atm. respectively. The data have been analyzed to determine the dependence of recovery, or current interruption capability, upon nozzle geometrical parameters. The analysis indicates that recovery is insensitive to nozzle divergence angle (ø) between 9°and 15°, but a cylindrical nozzle severely reduces arc interruption ability. Whereas recovery time tR decreases as the ratio of outlet area Ac to throat area At increases for low recovery voltages VR, a nozzle with a ratio of AC/ At equal to 2 minimizes tR at high VR because the nozzle expansion matches the expansion of the arc. The optimum value of upstream arc length ℓu is about one half of the effective nozzle throat diameter. An increase in ℓu causes a significant increase in ultimate dielectric strength, but if ℓ is greater than optimum, there is a tendency towards upstream energy accumulation, delaying recovery. Arc channel recovery is most rapid if the downstream arc length is either very short, thus limiting arc power input, or very long, thus reducing the voltage stress per unit length on the column when VR is applied."

"The propagation of voltage and current on transmission lines consisting of n conductors and ground is characterized by n modes, each composed of a particular combination of voltage and current waves, traveling at a common velocity and exponentially attenuated with distance. In general the modal composition is frequency dependent. Steady-state calculations for traveling waves on four typical ac EHV lines, at from 25 to 200 miles from the source, indicate that a real, frequency-independent modal-to-phase transformation matrix (rather than an operational one) might be used for the approximate calculation of step-function response. The elements of this matrix were defined as the real parts of the exact (complex) matrix corresponding to some \"effective, mid-range\" frequency-5 KHz proved appropriate in the cases examined."
"Radio Interference ( RI), generated due to the periodic switching of the valves, is an important factor in the design of HVDC converter stations. A method is developed in this paper for calculating the RI level of any given converter station layout. The method consists basically of determining the equivalent circuit for the valve turn-on transients, analyzing the currents as a function of frequency in all elements of the circuit, and finally calculating the RI around the station using the currents obtained above together with data on the physical layout of the station."
"A worldwide survey on transmission line radio noise was conducted by a joint CIGRE and IEEE task force with contributions from a large number of American n and overseas utility companies.

A companion paper discusses the field measurement program in greater detail."
"The increased use of series capacitive compensation for voltage control, stability, or loading on transmission systems had led to more extensive studies of the switching phenomenon of series compensated lines. In many EHV applications of series compensation, shunt reactors are also applied, further leading to certain unique switching phenomena. Voltages which can exist across series capacitors during very heavy load or fault conditions can be significant relative to system voltage, and therefore, can be of importance both in closing and opening lines. Analyses indicate several areas of concern not associated with non-series compensated lines including; a) protection of terminals against switching surges, b) low frequency oscillations in the shunt reactor-series capacitor circuit which may expose lightning arresters to very severe energy requirements, c) significant voltages across the circuit breaker when interrupting faulted lines. The first two areas will be discussed and the third analyzed in greater detail. The data in this paper was obtained from studies on the Transient Network Analyzer. 1 Figure 1 illustrates the system analyzed."

"The fact that, as a matter of necessity, power system steam turbines are in all cases equipped with control systems which include provision to close steam inlet valves rapidly on sudden loss of load as a way to suitably limit speed increase, implies that these systems are basically not difficult to modify so as to allow employment of fast valving as a way to maintain system stability despite the occurrence of a line fault or some other system stability endangering event."

"Results of full-scale tests on V-suspension strings up to 50 standard insulators (about 24-ft long) are presented and the need of such tests is demonstrated.

Oxidant-measuring techniques and criteria for selection of test locations are also described. Under the conditions of these tests, no measurable amounts of oxidants attributable to the presence and operation of the high-voltage installations were detected."
"The transient performance of three-phase heteropolar inductor alternators under sudden 3-phase short-circuit is presented in this paper. Lewis's transformation8 is utilized to formulate the basic differential equations of the alternator in terms of self-and mutual inductances. The inductor alternators with equal slot and tooth width of the rotor behave like cylindrical rotor synchronous machines, whereas those with unequal slot and tooth width of the rotor are similar to salient-pole machines. The transient reactance and time constants greatly depend on the ratio of the fundamental component of permeance variation to average permeance."
"The line-to-ground short-circuit case of an inductor-type synchronous generator is solved. Modified a, ß, 0 components have been used to formulate the basic differential equations of the alternator, which can be solved approximately to yield short-circuit currents. As compared to conventional synchronous machines these types of generators have lower short-circuit currents, and higher transient reactances. The short-circuit currents also decay at a comparatively faster rate than the normal synchronous machines."

"Highly sensitive ground fault relaying for generators in unit connection results from resonant neutral grounding. This scheme has the purpose to detect ground faults in their incipient stages anywhere on the low voltage side of the generator, that is, in the generator winding, the connections from the generator to the transformer and the transformer low voltage winding. The inherent advantages of resonant neutral grounding, when applied to unit connected generators, have been over-looked in this country - at present, this method is used only for the generators of one utility system. It, is shown how resonant neutral grounding provides greater sensitivity for detecting high resistance faults than other commonly used protective schemes, and how the current at the fault is reduced to such low value that the effects of iron burning of the stator can be made harmless. Experience with this protective scheme on the New England Electric System during a 20-year period is reported."
"The evolution of gas-cooled reactors is described and the advantages of helium as a reactor coolant stemming from its inertness and the fact that it is a single-phase coolant are discussed. The High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (HTGR) forms the basis for the current design of a Gas-Cooled Fast Breeder Reactor (GCFR). The extensive use of existing HTGR technology and the similarities between GCFR fuel requirements and those of the Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor (LMFBR) are emphasized. Basing the development on these other technologies minimizes the effort required for the GCFR."

"One of the protection systems in the nuclear power plant is the engineered safety features system. The design of an engineered safety features system, utilizing solid state circuitry, is presented in the following. The solid state engineered safety features system provides a flexible, accurate, compact and reliable system. This is accomplished by selecting components with low failure rate, dividing actuation channels into multiple subchannels, including the diesel generator load sequencing and bus load shedding, and incorporating unique built-in test features. The solid state design facilitates periodic testing while the reactor is in operation. This paper describes these features and their correlation to published standards and guides for protection systems."
"Controllable network VAr compensators are required in high voltage transmission networks for system loss reduction and voltage maintenance during normal and emergency operation. Long term planning of network compensators is generally based on contingencies which cause the system voltage to move out of the desired operational range.

The proposed approach is critically evaluated and compared with the existing techniques and is illustrated by an application to a high voltage model system."

"Forced outages due to failures of asphalt-mica insulated armature windings have been investigated. Based on information obtained from the public utilities, it is shown how the grounding and maintenance methods affect the possible core damage on older large turbine-generators. The probability of an outage can be greatly reduced by planned inspection, maintenance tests, and by replacement of those faulty bars which are most likely to fail."
"Field tests, computer simulation of the field tests, and computation of synchronizing and damping torque coefficients by means of frequency response analysis and modified frequency response analysis were carried out for the Mactaquac hydraulic turbine generators of the New Brunswick Electric Power Commission. The collected data is used to verify that the power stabilizers increase stability of the Mactaquac units, and as a basis for investigation into the methods used to calculate synchronizing and damping torque coefficients. Results indicated that the torque coefficients found by the modified frequency response analysis differ slightly from those obtained by the frequency response analysis, yet values obtained by either method provide a good indication of the dynamic stability of a generator."
"The design of turbine generators is strongly influenced by their requirements for negative sequence duty. In conjunction With a current revision to the ANSI C-50 standards, a review was made of the system requirements for I22t capability in generators of directly cooled sizes, tied into high voltage transmission systems. The results of these studies, which is the subjict of this paper, indicate that maximum expected I22t duty for system faults is less than two, or roughly one-third of the lowest I22t values specified in the revised standard, indicating also that a comfortable margin will still exist between system requirements and machine capabilities."
"A formulation of the linear induction motor based on the generalized machine theory is derived from the e.m. field theory formulation. The study includes short-stator end effect and a physical interpretation for the performance degradation due to end-effects. Results from the formulation are correlated with published data."
"In earlier papers1 2 the authors described investigations into the behaviour of stator end windings and stator cores. Details were given of the results of vibration measurements at the external circumference of the stator core laminations2. It was postulated that the vibration levels observed at rated current conditions were principally determined by the electromagnetic forces generated by the interaction of the currents in the stator and rotor conductors. This paper gives core vibration results from a generator running on test under no-load conditions, both at rated voltage on open circuit and at rated current on three phase sustained short circuit. The measured levels of vibration are compared with those determined by calculation. Because the magnitude of the exciting force is influenced by the length of the air gap, which in turn controls the short circuit ratio, a study is made of the way in which the choice of short circuit ratio can determine the vibration level. Also considered is operation under load conditions and, since the power factor at which the generator is operating determines the phase relationship of the two principal components of force, a study is made of the effect of power factor. Finally some anomalous behaviour observed on a large generator is discussed together with the possible effect of core vibration on the losses in, and temperature rise of, the stator core end laminations."
"A theoretical basis is established for calculating the transient current and torque developed by an induction machine due to switching operations. The method of calculations is similar to that used for synchronous machines. The validity of the theory has been checked with the experimental results on a model induction motor. Formulae presented in this paper can be further simplified by using empirical factors derived from a number of tests on large machines."
"Highly efficient methods are described for implementing the finite element method for analysis of electric machines. These include improved techniques for generating Jacobian matrices, implicit handling of boundary conditions, spline approximations to reluctivity characteristics, compact matrix storage and manipulation, and semiautomatic node ordering.

"This paper describes the application of a parameter optimizing technique to determine numerical values for a circuit model of a squirrel-cage induction machine. The model includes the effects of magnetic saturation of the main and leakage flux paths and skin effect in the rotor bars. All parameters have been measured at different voltage levels up to the rated value to demonstrate the effect of magnetic saturation."
"Permanent Power Fuse which is called by the abbreviated name P. P. F. is an entirely new reusable fuse with excellent current limiting performance developed by Mitsubishi Electric Corp. of Japan1. Since our previous work on the development of the series of the low voltage P. P. F. up to 800 A1 ., various P. P. Fused devices have been applied to the actual field. Among these applications, the application of the P. P. F. to a control center is an example which makes the very best use of the self-recovering function of the P. P. F. This paper explains the design considerations on the P. P. F. for use in a control center. In the considerations, emphases are put on quantitative discussions on the stable performance for repeated operation and the recovery time."
"The conventional peak kVA-kilowatthour usage relationships are not applicable for determining the peak kVA for transformers serving residential central air conditioning customers. The values of peak kVA for corresponding values of kWh consumption are significantly higher on transformers serving central air conditioning than those serving non-air conditioning loads. Traditionally, kWh sales has been, in most instances, the only parameter utilized in computing the peak kVA with remarkable success (standard errors usually do not exceed 6 kVA). However, the peak kVA found from kWh's for transformers consisting of air conditioning loads usually-possess standard errors well over 16 kVA."
"This paper presents the final results of the effects upon the health of linemen engaged in the maintenance of energized electrical transmission over a period of nine years. An initial report1,2 was presented in 1966 at the IEEE Summer Meeting in New Orleans, and the study has been continued to 1972. The evaluation was begun in December 1962 with ten linemen, four from the Ohio Power Company and six from the Appalachian Power Company (American Electric Power System)."
"A double-sided short-stator linear induction motor excited by a sinusoidally-distributed current sheet is analyzed. The motor characteristics are computed by expressing the magnetic vector potential in terms of difference equations, digitally solving these equations for the vector potential. The performance such as forces, losses, Poynting vectors, and efficience are obtained from the vector potential. Entry, and exit, edge-effects are taken into account by formulating the appropriate boundary conditions. The results are compared with those obtained from an idealized motor excited by a sinusoidally distributed current sheet of the same magnitude."
"Because superconducting machines lack well defined magnetic circuits and air gaps, some per-unit normalization methods used for conventional machines are not satisfactory. This paper presents six possible ways of normalizing the impedances of air-core machines, illustrating the processes with data from an experimental air core machine. It is found that a commonly used per-unit system may be used with certain modifications."
"A dynamic circuit model for a pole amplitude modulated three phase, induction motor is developed. The only parameter values required, in addition to the standard ones for ordinary induction motors, are an equivalent rotor slot depth to model skin effect in the bars and the distribution of rotor resistance and leakage reactance between the endrings and bars. Characteristics predicted by the model are compared with those measured on a 6/8-pole and a 6/4-pole machine. The effects of the mmf harmonics are correctly modelled, the difference between computed and measured torques being consistent with stray loss effects."
"A procedure is presented which enables one to design a current transformer (CT) to meet arbitrary specifications on the required number of cycles of accurate secondary current following a system short circuit which results in a fully offset short circuit current waveform. The procedure enables one to relate the resulting current transformer design to its physical characteristics and to its accuracy classification. The procedure also enables one to account for an arbitrary amount of remanent flux in the current transformer resulting from previous short circuit currents."
"This paper discusses the system performance aspects of AEP's experience with its 765-kV transmission network. The first segment of this network was energized in May 1969. Since that time, a total of 670 miles of 765-kV transmission has been placed in operation. This paper reviews the experience accumulated thus far with bringing segments of 765-kV transmission into service, as well as with real and reactive power flow, reactive compensation and supply, voltage control, and 765-kV equipment spare requirements."
"In this paper is outlined a method for analyzing transient operation of large turbogenerators illustrated by the special case of small disturbances response. This method involves the solution of Maxwell equations in the massive rotor materials. An approximate solution is provided by simple functions which permit completing energy calculations yielding the equivalent circuits and transfer functions. This method was applied to a 600 MW turbogenerator on which the same transfer functions were measured using a method which consists of statistically analyzing the alternator's response to random load changes. Lastly, calculated and test results are compared."
"This paper is concerned with the application of a new method to the problem of transmission planning expressed as a large finite Markovian sequential process over time. The method recognizes that in solving large sequential problems the complete enumeration of strategies is seldom feasible. The basic idea of Discrete Dynamic Optimizing (DDO) is to combine the deterministic search procedure of dynamic programming with a probabilistic search and a heuristic stopping criterion. The method is designed to take advantage of whatever information is known about the problem. Test results obtained with an experimental program are also given."

"This paper presents a modification of the well known Nodal Iterative load flow algorithm. The modification is shown to be capable of giving a significant improvement in convergence in routine applications and to give good convergence in a wide range of cases involving series capacitive branches. The modification causes no significant increase in program complexity."
"Electric shock frequently causes the arrest of breathing. This paper reports on an experimental investigation of this phenomenon. A convulsion is a likely consequence of a high voltage shock applied to the extremities. It is suggested that this convulsion may be reponsible for breathing failure."
"Description of newly designed watthour meter light load and inductive load adjustments having only one moving part in each. A conductive plate, here-tofore movable, now with three circuits, is fixed in position. The two outer circuits, oppositely displaced from center, are loaded by coils through which moves a magnetic screw for adjusting light load. The phasing adjustment is a similar screw, moving in a coil that loads the center circuit, simultaneously changing the gap in a magnetic circuit which picks up leakage flux for torque compensation and is located to avoid differential shunting of the side arm gaps."
"The power invariant, nonlinear differential equations, that describe the behavior of a two-phase equivalent of a balanced three-phase induction motor, are linearized about an arbitrary nominal point. Under the assumption that terminal voltage and system frequency can be approximated by a straight line segment over any interval of time, solutions of these small perturbation equations are used to give expressions for active and reactive power delivered tb the motor during transient conditions. These newly developed expressions for power, which turn out to be implicit functions of voltage and frequency, and explicit functions of time and the rates of change of voltage and frequency, are proposed as a load model represeptation of an induction motor for use in transient stability studies. An intuitively appealing, corrective technique, which reduces the error introduced by the use of a linearized model, is presented. Eigenvalues of the linearized system of equations for a group of typical induction motors are given. For a small low voltage motor, a sensitivity study of the dominant eigenvalue to changes in nominal point quantities and parameters is made. Values of active and reactive power calculated by a numericzal solution of the motor nonlinear differential equations are compared with those values of power predicted by the model for certain specific rates of change of voltage and frequency."

"Various analytical methods are available for predicting the performance of insulation stressed by lightning voltages of non-standard waveshape. This paper describes experimental and analytical studies for evaluating the effectiveness of the prediction methods. Flashover characteristics of typical line insulation were determined using standard and non-standard impulse waves viz., long front, partially chopped and oscillatory impulses. The standard impulse data were used to calibrate the analytical models, which were then used to predict the performance of the insulation stressed by non-standard impulses for comparison with the experimental data."

"The flashover performance of post-type support spacers for concentric compressed gas-insulated transmission lines was investigated. The experiments were made with SF6 gas at 4.4 atm. abs. and low frequency AC voltage in the EHV range. Nine cast epoxy spacers with metal inserts at each end shaped to produce different electric field distributions along the solid-gas interface were tested. The results show that flashover voltage is controlled by the electric field distribution and is inversely proportional to the stress enhancement in the gas. This conclusion is shown to be consistent with ionization-initiated breakdown at a certain stress limit about 300 kV/cm in these studies. The better designed spacers were limited by sparkover of the radial gas-gap at 1300 kV peak and not by surface flashover at the insulator."
"In a previous paper induction motor design optimization was formulated as a problem in nonlinear programming and the method of Sequential Unconstrained Minimization Technique (SUMT) was used to obtain the optimum design. The steepest descent method was used to obtain the minimum. In this paper details of a comparative study of five different unconstrained minimization techniques are given. Both indirect and direct search type methods are used in conjunction with SUMT. It has been found that direct search methods are specially suited for the types of functions occuring in rotating machine design problems."

"Techniques are developed for improving the speed of solution of transient stability studies which include the effects of synchronous machine amortisseur circuits and nonlinear variable-voltage loads. A fast, non-iterative method of solving the algebraic equations involving only direct matrix multiplication is discussed. Results of computer tests on a complex multi-machine system demonstrating the importance of load modelling and the effectiveness of the new proposed non-iterative solution technique are presented."
"A finite element program for calculation of electrostatic fields is described, where the grid is generated automatically from a drawing by means of a digitizer. A field plot made on a numerically controlled drafting machine can be called for as part of the program output. Sample calculations are presented, and a comparison is made with an analytical solution."
"Both foundation and building floor seismic response spectra, based upon a random type of earthquake input inotion, indicate that important quasi-resonance vibration buildup of about 5 to 10 times can occur in the usual 1 to 25 Hz frequency range of damaging seismic effects. However, dynamic analysis has shown that properly designed supports can be added to raise all bus run natural frequencies well-above 25 Hz, thereby causing the above-mentioned seismic vibration magnification to become negligible. The resulting stiffened and strengthened bus run configurations Would then be required to withstand only the specified earthquake-induced building floor motions amounting to about 0.2 to 0.5g. A steady vibration of 0.5g at 25 Hz results in an amplitude of only 0.008 in. Since such a small lateral deflection of a bus run section would produce only negligible bending stress, no strength failure or malfunction would be anticipated, provided there was no extreme relative motion in the building itself."
"There is current interest by many utilities to enhance security of operation through monitoring real time system information. American Electric Power is at this time in the final stages of testing what appears to be the world's first power system state estimation project to obtain a complete real time load flow solution of its EHV system."
"The Seneca pumped storage plant has been in commercial service since January 14, 1970. Synchronous starting of large reversible generator/motors by means of a small generator has proved to be highly reliable and the overall efficiency of the station ranges from 71 to 79 percent. Design modifications made since start-up are described."
"Dynamic voltage distribution on an insulator unit was investigated before and during scintillation activity. A simple method for the measurements of voltage distribution was successfully developed. It was observed that some parts of the leakage distance do not function during scintillations, and therefore the concept of \"effective leakage distance\" was introduced. A good correlationship between \" effective leakage distance\" and flashover voltage was found."
"Nozzle electrode shape in a gas blast circuit interrupter can cause very large magnetic forces to act on the arc. A rapid and inexpensive method for computing these forces is described. A conformal mapping technique is used in approximating the non-symmetrical 3-dimensional electrode current distribution by a large number of straight line segments of current. Superposition of the effect of each element determines the field at points of interest in the arcing region. Significant advantage exists over methods using numerical solutions of partial differential equations when knowledge of the, field is required at relatively few points."
"This paper describes frequency accelerated experiments employed in an investigation into discharge resistance of small samples of epoxy resin bonded mica materials used for turbine generator stator bar insulation. Surface discharge experiments have been performed in nitrogen and helium at NTP, and internal discharge experiments in dry air at NTP and hydrogen at 650C and 310 kN m-2. An acceleration factor of 24, nominal stress 4 kV mm-1, was used for the particular experimental arrangement without any apparent change in the progression of dielectric deterioration. Only one sample failed at the above stress, equivalent service lifetimes in excess of 25 years being recorded at which point experiments were terminated. All mica based materials to some extent delaminated forming natural cavities; within these cavities white dentritic deposits were formed which were determined to be the result of discharge action on mica. Puncture of mica flakes between natural cavities and tracking between mica flakes was also observed. In general the materials made from small mica flakelets appeared to withstand the discharge attack better than large flake materials although all materials had lifetimes of at least 25 years. Samples made from relatively narrow tapes indicated severe damage at tape junctions."
"Analysis of the phenomena of stability of synchronous machines under small perturbations as examined by Demello and Concordial, has been extended to the following: First, the change of the parameters K1 to K6 of the block diagram describing the system (Fig. 1) has been investigated for different loading and power factors. From this a set of curves has been plotted. Such curves can be used to reach a general conclusion about the variations of such parameters by changing the operating condition, which is an important factor in dynamic stability studies. Second, the dynamic stability of the system, as affected by different excitation, has been analyzed. The systems investigated are thyristor-type and type-I excitation systems. Their effect on dynamic stability has been compared. The results obtained by mathematical analysis have been checked by both digital and analog computer. From this and analysis a set of rules was developed which helps in understanding the stability requirements."
"This report of the Working Group on Continuous Unbalanced Current Capability is in answer to a desire of the Synchronous Machinery Subcommittee of the Rotating Machinery Committee to provide for the industry a standard of generator capability. This standard should be suitable for specifying a particular capability of a generator, and should be suitable for establishing a relationship with operating practices and Operating Guides prepared for this type of equipment. Having been ballotted and approved by the Synchronous Machinery Subcommittee, the report is being processed further with the expectation that it will be recommended for incorporation into a revision of ANSI C-50 for Rotating Machinery."
"Existing methods for transient stability equivalents all lack a means of drawing a consistent boundary between the equivalized area and the area represented in detail. In most methods, it is assumed that the generators equivalized are coherent. However, no simple method to identify them has been offered, which does not require a transient stability study of the entire system. A method using distance measures to draw boundaries and pattern recognition concepts to identify coherency is presented. Computation required is minimal. The method is incorporated in a computer program which is a useful tool for transient stability studies in power system planning."
"Three complementary approaches, analytical, numerical and experimental, presented here provide a better understanding of the dynamic behavior of power transformers under axial short circuit forces. The most general and rigorous theories for predicting the dynamic loads and displacements in the winding and in the clamping structure are developed. Both the winding and the clamp are discussed individually in Part I to develop a full understanding of their individual responses before discussing the combined system in Part II. Both parts take a major step forward in the art of the short circuit strength of power transformers."
"This paper is in continuation of Part I. It discusses the dynamic axial risponse of the total transformer system made up of the windings and the clamping structure. The numerical solution presented here accounts for all nonlinearities in the system. The viscoelastic model for representing the dynamic stiffness of the oil-permeated insulation is investigated in detail. Good comparisons between the calculated values and the test values on a 10 MVA transformer support the models and methods developed here."
"In electrical machines, the problem of vibration and noise reduction is assuming increasing importance. The accurate assessment of the resonance frequencies of the stator is essential in designing quiet electrical machines, since the coincidence between these frequencies and those of the exciting forces must be avoided."
"In connection with the reduction of noise in electrical machines, extensive investigations of te vibration behaviour ofthe main members of electrical machine are required. Detailed information about the nature of the frequency spectrum of the stator, the type of mode shapes associated with the various resonance frequencies and the effect of the frame is of much interest."
"This paper presents the report of the Joint Working Group for Review of High Potential Test Voltage of High Voltage Synchronous Machines, together with a short resumd of how it came into being."
"The influence ofunbalanced currents onthe design and operation of large turbine generators is described beginning with a summary of factory unbalanced current tests. Generator design considerations are discussed, including: rotor design features and practice, effects of short time and continuous unbalanced loading, and influence of unbalanced fault capability on major generator parameters. These considerations plus a summary of operating experience confirm that provision for unbalanced fault capability should not be an overriding consideration in the design of large generators, and support the need for industry standards revision."
"A unique test facility utilizing the inductive energy storage principle has been constructed in order to examine the characteristics of a fast acting HVDC interrupter. The facility is capable of producing currents up to 10, 000 A, developing voltages up to 200 kV, and storing energies up to 125 kJ. It is able to closely simulate the operational stresses encountered in the interruption of dc current. Experimental and computer results illustrate the operating characteristics of the facility."
"This paper presents a method of calculating the recovery overvoltages in a HVDC circuit and the optimization of the damping circuit by selecting the lowest value of the damping circuit capacitance and the resistance which together satisfactorily limit the recovery voltage. Furthermore, a new method is developed for exact calculation of the losses in the damping circuit using a hybrid computer. The effect of the bridge operation (commutating and delay angles) and damping circuit parameters on the losses are analyzed using numerical examples. Finally, a method for designing the valve damping circuit is presented."
"This paper presents the development of BIL (Basic Lightning Impulse Insulation Level) ratings for SF6 gas insulated substations from 72.5 kV to 765 kV. The unique properties of the gas insulated substation are analyzed and insulation coordination design techniques are utilized to determine BIL ratings for the substation equipment, other than the transformer, with a lightning arrester located at the entrance terminals. The resulting analysis shows that, in general, the required BIL level of apparatus for gas insulated systems can be lower than for conventional equipment because of lower surge impedance and shorter lengths of the gas insulated bus."
"During flashover tests with ac voltages, both the transformer and the test object may be subjected to excessively high overvoltages. If the recovery overvoltages occur during the negative half cycle, as is generally the case, external flashovers may not necessarily take place and the resultant high stress can damage the internal insulation of the transformer or the test object. The danger of the recovery overvoltage is even more pronounced in extra high voltage tests where several transformer units are cascaded to provide the required test voltage levels."
"This paper covers methods and equipment for live-line maintenance. It recommends minimum insulation and approach distances calculated on an engineering basis in terms of flashover and withstand levels for equipment and gaps. These recommendations are flexible and can accommodate revision in basic concepts. They present a basis from which working clearances and methods can be developed for specific needs in particular applications."
"The concept of subsynchronous resonance in series compensated transmission lines is presented. Contributions of synchronous generator rotor motion and induction generation to sustained subsynchronous oscillation are discussed. Computer simulation studies of a 500 kv transmission system are shown to closely correspond to actual system test data. Adverse effects of subsynchronous resonance on system components are described."
"The potential application of superconducting materials to large scale use in the electric utility industry is receiving increased attention. With the demand for electric power doubling every 10 years, power generation equipment ratings have been growing rapidly. Advances in many areas of generator design technology, including (a) direct conductor cooling, (b) stator winding short circuit and 120 Hz vibration control, and (c) materials suitable for scaled-up, more highly stressed components, have allowed power densities to increase so that today 1200 MWor larger units can be built and shipped, matching the size of the larger steam supplies and steam turbines that have become available. At the same time, overall plant reliability and availability have become the most important equipment considerations and will probably govern the rate at which larger ratings or new developments will be adopted by the industry in the future."
"The setting of control gains to fixed values has the drawback that if they are set to a low value then poor damping after a large disturbance will result. On the other hand setting them at a high level results in unnecessary chasing of small random disturbances with negligible improvement as far as the practical control objective is concerned."
"Three-phase alternators having high commutating reactances supplying resistive dc loads through parallel-bridge rectifier systems experience nearly balanced load conditions, continuous conduction for load resistances less than or equal to (l/√3) times the commutating reactance per phase and no line-to-line short circuits. This paper presents a discussion, supported by a detailed oscillographic record, of the operation of alternators with parallel-bridge rectifier systems. It also develops a method to predict the dc excitation current required to supply a dc load at any specified voltage and current. Experimental verification of the method shows excellent agreement over the entire range of operation. The results and discussion should be of significant value to those involved in the design and development of systems having rectified output synchronous machines."
"The application of series capacitors to compensate long-distance high-voltage transmission lines introduces potential modes of dynamic instability caused by interactions with synchronous machines and turbine-generator shaft torsional resonance.

Insight into the phenomena of modal interaction, a factor causing one of the unstable modes, is provided."
"This study considers the effect of modeling errors upon the real-time calculation of the bus voltages (or static state) of an electric power system. A criterion for evaluating the sensitivity of weighted least squares state estimation is developed, and the method is applied to a simulated model of an actual transmission system. The mathematical aspects of the analysis are discussed, and the experimental results indicate the effects of errors in several types of system parameters."
"This paper reports the results of studies conducted to establish the feasibility of implementing the state estimation algorithm described by J. F. Dopazo et al (1,2) on the Ontario Hydro 230 KV and 500 KV networks. The results are consolidated into normalized graphs which can be used as a basis for design decisions related to implementation of state estimation on systems having topological characteristics similar to those of the network investigated. The paper describes a modification of the Dopazo algorithm which permits weighting of individual measurements rather than of transmission lines. The modified algorithm is shown to have excellent error detecting capabilities."
"A complete model of a typical H.V.D.C. converter station suitable for fast transient studies is used to irivestigate the effect of the converter termination on switching-type surges coming from the dc-line. The surge transfer to the converter side of the dc-reactor and the surge distribution within the converter plint are also investigated. Finally, a dynamic model is used to calculate the surge transfer stresses during current extinction followirng a switching surge."

"The shortcomings of the existing standard dielectric test procedures for EHV transformers are stated. Proposals are made to correct the shortcomings. The proposals include dissociating the low-frequency test voltage requirements from the transient test voltage requirements, and relating each test independently to. corresponding operating conditions. Impulse and switching surge tests are related to the characteristics of the protecting surge arrester. Low-frequency tests are related to operating voltages. The duration of the low-frequency test is increased, and the magnitude is reduced. The trans former is connected, for the test, as it is connected in service. Continual monitoring of corona is recommended. The objective of the proposals is improved operating reliability by specifying tests which are more compatible with service requirements. Examples are given."
"Simple lumped-parameter circuit models for distributed grounding systems have been developed from the truncation of theoretical solutions. The simplest model utilizes two time constants; one for relatively short times and one for relatively long times. The variation of soil conductivity and permittivity with frequency is estimated and taken into account in the determination of the time constants. Estimating curves for the time constants are developed from experience in matching the experimental results of Kawai. Some practical applications of the circuit models are shown in comparing the indicial impedances of different grounding arrangements. The results confirm the fact that, for high resistivity soils, a combination of a concentrated, high-capacitance ground at the tower with a distributed, high-conductance ground of suitable length is superior to either system alone or to a continuous counterpoise."
"Some ten years ago Professor Otto Benedikt published a book entitled 'The Autodyne, a New Electrical Machine'. About the same time, however, machines engineers in the West were concentrating their efforts towards invertor fed machines using semiconductor devices, and because of this, interest in the potential of the autodyne has been negligable. This paper presents the theory and steady state analysis of the autodyne in familiar form, and gives the results obtained from a prototype machine, which was built up from an existing rotary convertor."
"Audible noise due to foul-weather corona on multi-conductor bundles for EHV and UHV transmission can be reduced by proper choice of the bundle geometry. Laboratory tests have been carried out to determine the noise generation of individual subconductor in a bundle. Based on the results of these tests, the relative audible-noise performance of several different con-figurations of 4-, 6-, and 8-conductor bundles are determined. A comparison is made between computed and measured performances for a 6-conductor bundle."

A ten year forecast is made and the factors that foreshadow shortages of engineers and technologists are discussed."
"This paaper shows how plastics materials may be affected by exposure to the outdoor environment. The possible effects of ultra violet light, atmospheric oxygen, moisture, gaseous and solid pollution are discussed in detail. Data obtained from extensive natural and accelerated weathering on a variety of materials demonstrates the practical significance of this information and shows that outdoor performance can vary dramatically between polymers and that even minor changes in the chemical constitution of either the polymer or the incorporated additives can have very significant and often detrimental effects."
"Transformer leakage reactances, short-circuit forces, and related quantities are derivable from the leakage flux distribution. Assuming axial symrimetry, flux is conveniently mapped by means of finite element techniques. Use of high-order elements permits reduction of approximating matrix order by a factor of 5-10, compared with the first-order elements previously employed. Typical flux patterns are shown. A new formulatiorn for the short-circuit forces, in terms of quantities related to the vector potential, is given, and it is shown that this formulation reduces the force calculation to a sequence of simple matrix multiplications; no numerical integration is necessary. A corresponding formulation for the leakage reactance is also given . It is coincluded that the use of few high-order elements, with direct solution of the resulting small matrix equations, is preferable to the iterative solution of large systems of equations resulting from large numbers of approximate first-order elements."
"A mathematical method for evaluating the probability of extreme magnitudes of switching surge overvoltages is proposed which includes correlation among the three phase circuit breaker pole closing times. The model utilizes published data for trivariate and bivariate normal probability functions. Examples are presented which illustrate critical aspects of the calculations, and suggestions are made regarding specific applications."
"Approximation methods and a computer program are presented, to facilitate the reliability evaluation of large power systems. The approximations are based on an extension of the minimal-cut approach for computing reliability, to cover models that can account for switching after faults. The program can select the required \"minimal-cut\" failure states through an analysis of the failure effects in every state, and calculate the overall system reliability indices, if certain system failure criterial apply."
"After describing briefly the salt fog test, the authors show, by means of comparisons between laboratory results and results obtained in natural environments. that the behaviour of insulators in salt fog is very similar to their behaviour in representative types of natural conditions. Having thus established that the salt fog test is representative, the paper derives certain fundamental rules relating to the behaviour of insulators in salt fog as a function of their geometrical and surface characteristics. The importance of such rules is stressed in relation to the choice, on a quantitative basis, of insulators for areas with different degrees of pollution and suggestions are made as to the criteria and methods to adopt for classifying such areas."
"This paper describes a new approach to optimized generation planning based on the development of large numbers of expansion patterns comprising all possible combinations of selected units. This approach yields markedly different results from the step-by-step minimum cost for each year method, and assures that the optimum pattern at least has been examined. Not only is the lowest total cost pattern identified, but the relationship of any particular pattern to the optimum is readily apparent. The sensitivity of the results to possible variation in investment costs, escalation factors, fuel prices, and system load factors easily can be determined."
"Present laboratory impulse tests do not simulate the large power-frequency voltages which may be present in practice. Experiments up to 850 kV (impulse) show that such bias fields have no significant effect on impulse breakdown. The 50% breakdown strength for both fast \"lightning\" impulses (1.7 sμ rise time) and for slower \"switching\" impulses (80μs rise time) was measured on 1.75 m point-plane and sphere-plane gaps with bias voltages from zero up to 200 kV r.m.s. and at various points-on-wave. A laser triggered gap was used to protect the impulse generator from the power frequency voltage."
"Basic models for speed-governing systems and turbines in power system stability studies are presented. These models provide adequate representation for hydro, fossil-fired, and pressurized water reactor nuclear units in most stability analyses. Models for boiling water reactor nuclear units are to be presented at a later date. Typical parameters are given."
"This paper presents a Common Format for the exchange of solved load flow cases. This format is presently being used throughout most of the eastern and north central United States and parts of Canada.

The paper presents a detailed description of the format as well as procedures for making revisions and additions."
"Digital computer techniques are used to simulate a steady-state d-c arc. The (longitudinal) input and (radial) loss powers to a section of the positive column are used to establish the positive column temperature and electron density. A power balance is also used to derive cathode conditions. Finally, current adjustment is made so that the positive column and cathode results agree. For given input conditions (voltage, arc length, gas), current and temperature are calculated; some input choices do not lead to valid arc conditions. Results are shown to compare well with experimental data."
"It is important to have reliable field techniques for assessing the insulation quaility of large rotating machine stators in order to reveal any defects which could lead to a winding failure in service. Toward this objective, a variety of nondestructive measurements of internal discharges (corona) have been applied and compared on an old mica-asphalt insulated generator. Extensive field measurements of RIV corona and integrated corona charge per cycle (related to power factor tip-up) are reported and interpreted, and verified by tests on coils returned to the laboratory."
"The application of Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS) up to 275kV substations has been proven and the authors have been working jointly on the research and development, with a view of supplying GIS for the 500kV trunk systems in the near future. To demonstrate the reliability and intearity of GIS. a prototype installation was provided and subjected to excess voltage and current during endurance and service tests. The satisfactory results obtained have led to the Kansai Electric Power Co. (KEP CO) Japan placing orders for a 500 kV substation to be commissioned in March 1973. The paper covers some specific engineering problems encountered on 500kV GIS, the results of tests and the investigations of its application."
"This paper applies the modern control theory to design HVDC controllers. The state regulator and tracking techniques have been used to design controller feedbacks to improve system performance. Both optimal and sub-optimal controllers have been designed. An 'eigenvalue search' technique has also been applied to determine the desired controller gain and time constant. Using the various designed controllers, the dynamic performance of the system has been studied on both a digital computer and a small scale simulator. Some of these time domain studies are included in addition to the root locus plots."
"A weather sensitive model for summer afternoon peak loads has been developed and applied to both short and long-term forecasting on the Virginia Electric and Power Company system. The model itself and its performance during the summer of 1972, are described. The model features a stationary load-weather function and separation of the base load and weather sensitive load components. This allows trending and independent forecasting of the two components and computation of summer severity statistics represented by the values of the weather function."
"A procedure has been developed to determine the maximum simultaneous power interchange capability into a company (area) from its neighboring companies. The optimal combination of scheduled transfers with the neighbors to provide the maximum import is determined. The procedure identifies the outages and the facilities which limit the transfers. The new Interchange Capability Program (INCHCAP) developed at Commonwealth Edison Company and the optimizing technique f Linear Programming are used. Both transmission and generation limitations are considered."
"The authors have designed and tested a compact, simple and durable transient coupling sensor which can be used for short term or continual monitoring of switching surge phenomena on power transmission systems. The device's design principle and operating characteristics are described, its ability to reproduce hypothetical, yet practical, surge waveforms is analyzed mathematically and its performance in service is shown to be consistent with calculations."
"This paper describes the installation at Kafue Gorge (Zambia) of 330-kV oil-filled cables conveying through a 1600-ft. vertical shaft the 600-MVA power generated in the underground power plant to the external switchyard."
"This paper deals with the problems of an integral water cooled cable system to increase the capability of 154 kV underground transmission line. The trial line equivalent to a commercial one was constructed to investigate the cooling effect of cable and joints, the suppression of thermal expansion and so on. We found that the transmission of 500 MVA/cct of 154 kV 2000 mm2 aluminum sheathed oil filled cable is possible using it. Descriptions are given of these results."
"As the test voltage level increases, it becomes more and more difficult to protect the control and measuring cables from the disturbances generated during the tests. To cope with this problem, new high voltage laboratories are nowadays equiped with a copper floor net used as ground return. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the transient response of such a ground return system. The calculated performances compare favorably with experimental results obtained with the ground return system of the high voltage laboratory at IREQ, and can apply to the selection of the proper ground return system in new high voltage test areas."
"The economic dispatch problem is formulated as a quadratic programming problem and solved using Wolfe's algorithm. The method is capable of handling both equality and inequality constraints on p, q, and v and can solve the load flow as well as the economic dispatch problem. The quadratic programming algorithm does not require the use of penalty factors or the determination of gradient step size which can cause convergence difficulties. Convergence was obtained in three iterations for all test systems considered and solution time is small enough to allow the method to be used for on-line dispatching at practical time intervals. Results are presented for 5, 14, 30, 57, and 118 bus test systems."
"An analysis of three-dimensional asymmetric field distribution in SF6 gas insulated cables is shown. The equations to be used in the calculation are derived drecty from Gauss' theorem, and this procedure is quite simple. The field problems in the cables with epoxy pole spacers are solved by digital computer. The solutions are examined on referring to the experimental results."
"Matrix analysis is described of voltage and current propagations along a resistive conductor system above an imperfectly conducting ground. Square matrices and their functions are considered as operators in a vector space. Conductor voltages and currents are represented as vectors and resolved into modes or eigenvectors of the propagation matrix. It is shown that although the modal transformation is hot power invariant the mode are independent but not orthogonal. General and modal reflection-free line terminations are developed. A brief review of some simplified modal analyses is described. A numerical solution is demonstrated. Mathematical background is appended."
"A brief comparison of the salient aspects of modal analyses of lossless and lossy lines is described. Simplified equations for modal parameters of a three-phase horizontal line are demonstrated. Effects of earth resistivity, Pe, on the modal attenuations and velocities of propagation on a 500-kV line are discussed for Pe from 20 Ωm to 2000 Ωm at three frequencies, F: 50kHz, 100kHz and 200kHz. Modal voltage components, general and modal reflection-free line terminations are derived and compared with those for the lossless line. It is found that angles of all modal complex parameters and of line terminations are small."
"A comprehensive study of ac corrosion of aluminum alloys has led to a proposed mechanism of attack based on local pH changes. A critical alternating current density of 0.5 ma/in2 has been defined below which no corrosion occurs. At higher current densities the corrosion is time dependent. Engineering design data is presented."
"This paper presents a rea1-time hybrid, analog-digital, computer technique for differential protection of generators. The fault/no fault decisions are based on the amplitude ratio of the \"fault\"' and \"average through\" currents from a selected generator phase. Analog input data pre-processor, fault monitor and soft-ware segments suitable for valid comparison during the transient period after the inception of a fault are described. Typical examples, from out of approximately 800 case studies, including internal and external faults using a three phase generator are presented."
"This paper illustrates a frequency and duration approach to short term reliability evaluation. The concepts of interval frequency and fractional duration are defined and numerical techniques for their calculation are developed. These definitions and techniques can be applied to any system of repairable or non-repairable components but they become especially significant in the area of spinning reserve calculations. The development of the generation model and-its convolution with the forecast load is outlined in detail. These indices have been interpreted so as to give a better insight into their physical meaning and their significance has been illustrated by application to a hypothetical system."

"An instrument for measurement of color of cathode ray tube screens has been developed and evaluated. It consists of four filters and photocells coupled to a special purpose analog computer with readout directly in C.I.E. x and y on a pair of digital panel meters. Accuracy is within one percent of the spectroradiometer used for calibration. Possible future developments and applications include set-up and tracking white on color receivers, measurement in terms of C. I. E. uniform chromaticity system and, perhaps, incorporation of direct readout in brightness."
 "A new active convergence system by two monolithic IC's has been developed for both 90-and 110-degree color picture tubes."
"Integrated Circuits (ICs) in consumer equipment are a fact. In 1973 in excess of 40 million pieces will be used in TV sets and more than 25 million pieces will go into audio applications, to name only two consumer markets. The total number of consumer ICs available will exceed 180 million pieces. If they do not all work properly, there will be a certain number of disatisfied TV viewers, radio listeners, tape recorder owners, and other users of IC equipment. ICs are tested to prevent this occurrence. Testing schemes employed vary considerably and are covered in the following discussion. Test philosophies will be pointed out and a recommendation for specifications will be made."
"The two channel FM Stereo Broadcast System1 in use today was extended by General Electric to a 4-channel system; and, in October 1971 this proposed General Electric 4-channel FM Stereophonic Broadcast System was successfully field-tested on an experimental basis in the Schenectady, New York area over radio station WGFM2. This system is compatible with present two-channel stereophonic and monophonic broadcast receivers, provides equal noise characteristics at the four audio outputs and allows the use of the Subsidiary Communication Authorization (SCA) channel at a higher 95 KHz subcarrier. The system transmits the full audio frequency range of 30 to 15,000 Hz on each of four audio channels and maintains at least 30 db audio separation between each of them. The measured harmonic distortion and intermodulation distortion falls well within the existing FCC requirements for broadcast equipment."
"The General Electric Company has expanded the two channel FM stereo broadcast system into a 4-channel one that provides compatibility with present stereophonic and monophonic FM broadcast receiversl. The system exhibits equal noise characteristics at each of the receiver output terminals and allows the use of the Subsidiary Communication Authorization (SCA) channel within the present 200 KHz channel allocations. The system transmits the full audio frequency range of 30 to 15000 Hz on each of the four audio channels and maintains in excess of 30 db audio separation between each of them. Figure 1 shows the total baseband utilization. In this paper, attention will be given to the 76 KHz subchannel with the unique vestigial sideband feature."
  "The automotive radio industry is constantly working to develop radios that are more reliable, less costly to build, and physically smaller, while at the same time giving performance comparable with existing radios."
"A notable characteristic of transistor power amplifiers using complementary pairs as applied to TV vertical deflection systems is unbalanced dissipation in the output devices. The reasons for this unbalance and some of the factors influencing it are discussed in this paper."
"The design of new integrated circuits must be oriented to the cost and flexibility demanded by the function. This paper describes a new I/C which houses the horizontal APC system in only 8 pins while retaining excellent flexibility. Simple, yet sufficient circuits for the RC oscillator and balanced phase detector have all important parameters available externally. A special predriver circuit uses one pin to adjust the output for any type of horizontal driver. By modifying the external circuitry, the TV designer can tailor the I/C to meet a wide range of performance requirements in monochrome and color TV."

   "The use of new processing techniques, coupled with innovative circuit design and packaging techniques, have resulted in lower-cost, higher-performance consumer integrated circuits. These devices have aided domestic entertainment electronics manufacturers in meetingthe challenges posed by low-cost, off-shore competition. Continued advancement of consumer products will depend upon further refinements in both processing and in design techniques. The technique of ion-implantation offers many potential benefits to the device as well as the equipment designer. These benefits include high-value, accurate-resistor values which can be fabricated with significantly reduced chip area, conventional MOS as well as CMOS capability, and compatible high quality varactors combined with dual gate MOS devices. Applications of the technology are apparent in today's products and in future products will only be limited by the ingenuity of designers themselves."
"Due to the demands of the public, recent legislation has been enacted to curb noise emanations from a multitude of sources. This has caused concern in industry in two ways. \"First, the various noise levels under which a product is manufactured must be maintained within the law to prevent hearing damage risk to production workers. Second, the noise level generated by the operation of a particular product must be within designated standards. In the latter case, the annoyance of the sound level output is generally more important than the hearing damage risk for consumer products because of their reduced emissions."
"Over the past few years, integrated circuit production has been dominated by the manufacture of digital circuits which typically operate at rather moderate power levels. For example, 5400 and 7400 series TTL circuits will dissipate approximately 150 mW. Recently, the use of linear circuits in consumer applications has been on the increase, and it is not unusual for such circuits to operate at power levels an order of magnitude higher than their digital counterparts. As an example, the Sprague Electric Company now offers the ULX-2277 dual audio amplifier which delivers 2 watts per channel of continuous power. Heretofore, power levels such as this were encountered only in power transistors packaged in metal cans. It was a relatively simple matter to measure thermal resistances of such packages by attaching a thermocouple to the base of the can, or to a mounting stud or heat sink, and using this reading as case temperature. The measurement would then be carried out according to some procedure, such as that outlined in MIL STD 883."
"The following paper describes a single die, integrated, monolithic, sound system. Total function includes 4.5mHz I. F. limiting and amplification, quadrature F.M. detection, external D.C. volume control, audio power and preamplification, plus an internal supply line voltage regulator. Substantial performance ance gains throughout were realized with improved circuit and device design techniques."
"The increased demand for semiconductors in the consumer market place has accelerated the need for improved product reliability. This need has been well recognized by the manufacturer and consumer. Often the consumer quality and reliability demands are tougher than required for military products --understandably so, when you consider the staggering cost of rework on line rejects, the repair of field failures (especially when warranties are involved), and the possibility of a bad reputation. Even though the price competition within the semiconductor industry has intensified, the manufacturer has to meet this challenge with good designed-in reliability and rigid process control. In addition, if a plastic encapsulant is used, it needs to exhibit a reliability approaching that of hermetic devices. Ultimately, the consumer can add to his system reliability by understanding the physical and electrical limitations of semiconductors, and recognizing the definite reliability improvements that can be achieved by integrating circuitry whenever possible."
"Advances in technology have made available Silicon High Voltage Transistors for use in television line scan applications. The basic structure of such-devices is discussed comparing with conventional low voltage power devices showing the dominance of the high voltage devices collector region. It will be skhown how this large collector volume impacts on the common emitter characteristics, reducing gain, and the switching characteristics, due to the large amounts of collector stored charge."
"This paper describes a monolithic integrated circuit for processing the chrominance signal in a color television receiver. In performing the functions of color subcarrier regeneration and chroma control, emphasis has been placed on utilizing all the information available in the signal so as to approach ulti-mate system performance capability, while at the same time substantially reducing the number of external components and adjustments."

       "Standard methods of obtaining the image sharpness of a color picture tube from MTF considerations are shown to lead to erroneous results if the non-linear response of the eye is not taken into consideration. A new method is proposed in which the line profile of a single raster line is modified, both for luminance response and frequency response of the human eye, to determine a modified MTF curve. The area under the modified MTF curve (called the image sharpness value-ISV) is shown to correlate well with viewing results."
"The colorimetric characteristics of cameras and displays, and the inter-relationship between them, are as pertinent to the subject of color reproduction as are the electrical characteristics. Colorimetry in general, and television colorimetry in particular are not however well understood by most television receiver engineers. In part, at least, this is due to the lack of a concise survey of the subject. This paper is intended to serve as an introduction to most facets of television colorimetry and as a brief survey of its evolution from inception of the NTSC System (1953) to the present (1973). A bibliography lists references for further study."
"An Automatic Chroma Control (ACC) amplifier was developed using for gain control a conventional small signal transistor operating as a variable degeneration element in the emitter of the amplifier stage. The gain-control transistor was operating around the knee of its collector characteristic, and acted like a linear variable resistor. The resistance was controlled by a small DC current in the base. Mathematically, the behavior of such transistor was described by Ebers and Moll in 1954 -hence the name."
"In recent years the FCC has, through legislation, placed increasing requirements on television and tuner manufacturers to provide tuning of both VHF and UHF channels on an equal basis together with a means of indicating the exact channel number. FCC Part 15 Regulations state, \"If any television receiver is equipped to provide repeated access to UHF television channels at discrete tuning positions, the manufacturer shall provide for the display of the precise UHF channel selected or shall provide to the user a means of identifying the precise channel selected...\" In applications using varactor VHF/ UHF tuners with all electronic channel selection, there is no rotary shaft on which to fasten a channel indicator dial. Some means of channel number display other than mechanical is then necessary."
"An electronic gyrator is a two-port capable of transforming a capacitor into an inductance and therefore allows one to construct a tuned circuit using only transistors, resistors and capacitors. At frequencies below say 1 MHz it is possible to simulate inductance of high purity, but the value of capacitance required demands the use of discrete capacitors. The cost advantage of monolithic circuitry is therefore denied, but very high performance tuned circuits are possible."
"Normally, television receivers require manual adjustment for the horizontal and the vertical synchronization. In this paper, a highly-stable synchronizing circuit is described. It requires no manual adjustment."
"Many novel circuit designs could not have been previously applied to consumer electronics because of the complexity and cost involved. Modern semiconductor technology removes the obstacles by allowing the use of the monolithic integrated circuit."

    "Although there are no industry standards, the white reference for television receivers in the U.S.A. is generally intended to be in the vicinity of a blackbody radiator at 9300 K. This relatively high color temperature (compared with other \"white\" colors in our environment) is partly a legacy from monochrome television (the color of \"bright\" phosphors), but even more it is a result of the compromise between brightness and color required in the past by the available phosphors in color receivers. For example, for a particular phosphor combination in shadow-mask receivers, the electrically desirable condition of equal drives to the three electron beams resulted in the 9300-K color. It appears that colorimetric fidelity has not been a primary factor in the choice of receiver white color. The dominating factor has been a desire for high brightness."
"This paper will describe a single-vidicon color television camera. This camera, shown in Fig. 1, was designed with the idea that it will eventually be used in the consumer home entertainment market. The basic requirements, therefore, are low cost, small size, high reliability, NTSC compatible, and requiring little or no technical skill to operate. It is fully automatic with the only operating control being the ON-OFF switch. A self contained electronic viewfinder is included to display what is being televised, as well as provide instant playback of signals recorded on a VTR. The output signal is a 1 VPP NTSC compatible video signal with a 75 ohm output impedance. A standard -65 dbm audio signal is also available on a separate output. The entire system is line operated and draws a total of 50 watts. The camera head (including viewfinder and 4:1 zoom lens) weighs 6.9 lbs. while the video processor unit weighs 8.8 lbs. The output video S/N ratio is better than 40 db for a normally lighted living room scene."
"This paper presents a description of the theory and operation of a new television add-on data communication system which does not utilize the vertical interval. The basic add-on signalling technique allows more efficient utilization of the television spectrum. Added information, producing no perceptible interference with either the picture, or ancillary and test signals, is sent through a television channel along with the standard video signal. Novel techniques to significantly reduce errors in the data channel will be described. Several interesting systems utilizing this new signalling method have been built and will be described in this paper."
"Black and white picture tubes, with the exception of certain special purpose tubes, are currently all nearly wide-angle deflection types. Similarly, wide deflection angles are now being adopted in the color picture tube field. Since the principle of the color picture tube is far more complex than that of the black and white tube, a sophisticated production technology is necessary, and consequently production techniques of wide deflection angle color tubes are less advanced at present. Companies producing the conventional 3-gun shadow mask tube recently have successively announced improvement of their mass production technology and have greatly changed the design of the tube itself in their efforts to achieve ease of production comparable to that of the 90°deflection tube. Since their principal objective is to make the picture tube thinner, achievement of picture quality at the same level as in the 90°deflection tube is one of the problems."
 "The development of Touch-Tuning Systems for television receivers marks the first significant change in this function in twenty-five years. Impetus for the change has been provided by the availability of solid-state, varactor VHF and UHF tuners which have the advantage of no moving parts, together with silent, instantaneous control by dc voltages."
"Remote control systems for television receivers have, in general, tended to fall into the category described by the block diagram shown in Figure 1. This usually consists of an ultrasonic CW generator which transmits a specific frequency to the receiver for each control function required. The receiver system comprises an ultrasonic pick-up transducer and amplifier feeding the received signal to a series of tuned band-pass amplifiers, one for each frequency. The detected signal is then used to activate the desired control function. The signal frequencies employed are in the 30 to 50kHz range. Some of the problems with this type of system include range and directionality of the transmitter, receiver response to spurious inputs, e. g. coin/key noises, and the complexity of the receiver circuitry and its alignment. It is to this latter problem that this paper principally addresses itself."
"With the advent of four channel sound, higher power amplifiers and a trend toward component systems, there is a need for reduced size and weight in audio systems. The conventional transformer, rectifier and large filter capacitor power supply represents a large percentage of the total space and weight of an amplifier system; therefore, this is a logical starting point for a space and weight reduction program."
  "During the past decade commercial sound reproduction has progressed from monophonic to two-channel stereophonic reproduction. Now, four-channel sound sources are rapidly becoming dominant for music reproduction. Since the pilot tone system of broadcasting in use today is limited to two channels, a new but fully compatible four-channel system was developed. This \"Dorren Quadraplex System\" was designed from the start to meet the following conditions: .full compatibility with all existing equipment; .unimpaired directionality and channel separation; .reproduction of the frequency range 50 to 15,000 Hz in all channels; .minimum distortion and cross-talk between channels; .minimum signal-to-noise ratio impairment .no additional RF spectrum requirements Experimental use of this system for broadcasting began at radio station KIOI (125 kW ERP) in San Francisco in December 1970, with a Station Temporary Authorization from the Federal Communications Commission. Additional broadcasts were done over another major station, CHFI (210 kW ERP) in Toronto, Canada. This test was supervised by the Department of Communications and the Canadian Radio and Television Commission. It was found that, \"Compatibility was evident in all cases\". Additional testing and use is expected in Japan in the near future. The system has shown itself to offer performance for better than the minimum FCC standards and, therefore, its performance in production can be guaranteed."
 "The two channel FM Stereo Broadcast System1 in use today was extended by General Electric to a 4-channel system; and in October 1971 this proposed General Electric 4-channel FM Stereophonic Broadcast System was successfully field-tested on an experimental basis in the Schenectady, New York area over radio station WGFM2. This system is compatible with present two-channel stereophonic and monophonic broadcast receivers, provides equal noise characteristics at the four audio outputs and allows the use of the Subsidiary Communication Authorization (SCA) channel at a higher 95 KHz subcarrier. The system transmits the full audio frequency range of 50 to 15,000 Hz on each of four audio channels and maintains at least 30 dB audio channel separation between each of them. The measured harmonic distortion and intermodulation distortion falls well within the existing FCC requirements for broadcast equipment."
"The Zenith Quadraphonic FM Broadcast Systems (NQRC designations, 2A, 3B) are capable of broadcasting four discrete audio signals and are compatible with existing monophonic and biphonic FM services as well as with the Subsidiary Communication Authorization (SCA) service presently in practice. Two additional subchannels are broadcast in addition to the monophonic channel and the biphonic subchannel to accommodate the additional audio signals. The first of these additional subchannels uses double sideband suppressed carrier (DSBSC) AM modulation and is broadcast in quadrature with the existing biphonic subchannel at 38 kHz. System 2A, utilizing upper single sideband suppressed carrier (SSBSC) AM, broadcasts the second additional subchannel at 76 kHz while system 3B, utilizing vestigial sideband suppressed carrier (VSBSC) AM, broadcasts the second additional subchannel at 90.25 kHz. Both systems provide the necessary spectrum for the existing SCA subchannel centered nominally around 67 kHz. Standard pre-emphasis is employed to broadcast the four discrete audio signals in the band from 50 Hz to 15 kHz. Both systems broadcast an additional pilot subcarrier (at 76 kHz for system 2A and at 90.25 kHz for system 3B) to provide automatic decoder operation for monophonic, biphonic or quadraphonic signals. Sufficient phase linearity is maintained in the baseband spectrum (50 Hz to 91 kHz for system 2A, 50 Hz to 93 kHz for system 3B) to assure adequate separation between the audio outputs."
"It is proposed that the previously described QNX matrix [1] be used to provide the information content for quadruplex FM transmission, QFMX. In this proposal, a true, omnidirectional signal 'T appears in the baseband of the composite FM modulating signal, while a directionally encoded stereodifference signal T modulates the normal-phase 38-kHz subcarrier and a conjugately>encoded difference signal T modulates the quadrature-phase 3w-kHz subcarrier. The fourth signal TQ is provided via SSB (single sideband) modulation of a synchronized 57-kHz subcarrier, using the upper sideband. The bandwidth of TQ may be selected at the broadcaster's option to be 3 kHz, if SCA (subsidiary communication authorization) is to be used, or 15 kHz if SCA is not to be used. If used, the SCA signal may occupy the band from 64 kHz to 91 kHz, or some fraction thereof. Suitable pilot signals are provided, at 19 kHz, 57 kHz, and 95 kHz."

 "A technique that makes use of a multichannel analyzer for corona pulse-height analysis (PHA) is described. Typical corona pulse-height distribution spectra, obtained as a function of applied voltage and time at constant voltage stress, are presented."
"Perspex electrets having a sphere-plane electrode geometry were made by heating to 160°C, and cooling to 20°C while a positive-forming voltage of 15 kV was continuously applied to the spherical electrode. Their mean breakdown voltage for positive impulse breakdown was higher by 18 kV than that of similar specimens termed nonelectrets, which had undergone the same heat treatment but to which no forming voltage was applied, and was lower by 38 kV when the polarity of the breakdown voltage was reversed. When the electrets were depolarized by reheating to 160°C with their electrodes short-circuited, their mean breakdown own voltage was the same as that of nonelectrets. These results are consistent with a homocharge in the electret close to the electrode, which can be released during depolarization by heating. Measurement of depolarization current using electrets made from flat plates of Perspex supports this view."
"The dependence of the static electric field distribution on dissolved water and air in the ranges 8-38 ppm and 0.5-4.6 percent by volume, respectively, for parallel plate electrodes, is examined for two chlorobiphenyls by means of the Kerr electro-optical technique. It is shown by measurement of the field distribution at 23°C for a 0.5-cm electrode separation and applied fields up to 160 kV/cm, dissociation of the water molecule results in an exponential distribution of positive space charge giving rise to an enhanced cathode field. The enhanced cathode field near breakdown own remains unchanged regardless of increasing water content corresponding to decreasing breakdown potential. Furthermore, it is shown that conduction is largely due to a unipolar process. The presence of air is shown to decrease the cathode field enhancement, this is thought to be due to recombination of the O2 molecules and H ions. The space charge limited current and breakdown phenomena are discussed in relation to the enhanced cathode field."
"In vacuum, the surface of insulators becomes electrically charged when subjected to high-voltage stresses. The charging mechanism is described. A model simulating the charging shows that the surface charge densities are proportional to the applied voltage and depend on the secondary electron emission of the dielectric surface. It is also time dependent. Surface charges are shown to explain many results obtained in studies of insulator surface breakdown."
"The explosions of two of Hydro-Quebec's 230-kV air-blast circuit breakers were investigated. They resulted from the thermal degradation of the silicone rubber wire insulation that led to the formation of an explosive gas mixture (methane-air) inside one of the pressurized opening resistor chambers. Gas evolution rate versus current was measured during thermal degradation of the wire insulation in a laboratory experiment simulating real service conditions. The tolerance limits of the resistor insulation to thermal shock were evaluated. Results showed that the degradation process occurs with a very high speed. More than 300 1 of methane could be generated in the resistor chamber in less than 1 s."
"The Kerr electrooptic effect is used to study the electric field distortion introduced into a uniform field gap in nitrobenzene by solid dielectric spacers bridging the gap. The results show that the field is distorted by the introduction of the solid, and the degree and location of the distortion depend upon the electrical properties of the solid. The results are compatible with space charge accumulation in the solid dielectric spacer."

"Salt-fog tests as per International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) recommendations were conducted on stationtype insulators with large leakage lengths. Later, tests were conducted to simulate natural conditions. From these tests, it was understood that the pollution flashover would occur because of nonuniform pollution layers causing nonuniform voltage distribution during a natural drying-up period. The leakage current during test conditions was very small and the evidence was that the leakage current did not play any significant role in causing flashovers. In the light of the experimental results, some modification of the test procedure is suggested."
"An empirical correlation between thermal analysis data and ASTM D-2307 results for magnet wire enamels is presented. This correlation was sought as an aid in rapid screening of experimental wire enamels and was not intended as a replacement for the ASTM test. Correlation testing was carried out on a variety of commercial and experimental enamels on copper wire in air, nitrogen, oxygen, wet oxygen, and R-22 refrigerant via thermogravimetry (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). Wet oxygen and R-22 damaged the test equipment and so were not used for the complete spectrum of enamels. The \"best\" correlations were obtained in air. Reproducibility studies were carried out on samples from six different production runs of each of two enamels. The reproducibility was sufficiently good to allow identification of serious changes in enamel formulation. Variations of the correlations versus wirecuring speed (factor of two) were found to be within the reproducibility limits. The \"best\" correlations were derived from least squares plots which exclude thermal analysis results for the highest temperature enamels (polyimides). Preliminary experiments on the effects of copper oxides on thermal analysis data for polyimides indicate that such testing yields data giving a better fit to the correlation curve."
"Selected properties of thermal impulse-bonded laminates, made from polyethylene film and flexible glass ribbon, respectively, bonded to aluminum foil without an adhesive, are investigated as functions of the temperature, pressure, and duration of the bonding process. For the glass/metal laminates a combination of low-temperature (relative to the softening point), low-pressure, and long-time bonding produces the highest yields in dielectric breakdown and in hermeticity tests. For the plastic/metal laminates maximum peel bond strength is achieved with high-temperature (relative to the melting range) high-pressure bonding, with dielectric strength being somewhat below the potential maximum. In order to optimize these properties, the volume of air and other gases entrapped, adsorbed, and occluded in the interfaces and within the dielectric must be minimized in the bonding process, especially near the edges of the laminates."
"In these days, the solventless resin-impregnated mica insulation systems are extensively adopted to the large powergenerator stator-coil insulation systems as a result of rapid development of synthetic resin in recent years. Various destructive and nondestructive tests with these samples were made. The electrical properties were compared between the initial coils (which were measured by the electrical properties at the acceptance test) and the used coils (which were taken out from the generator winding that was used for about ten years). It is said that the winding insulation systems will change during long running times because of a number of factors such as thermal, mechanical, and electrical. Studies by the present authors show that used coils were not deteriorated by mechanical stress because electrical breakdown voltages did not decline in comparison with those of the initial coils, and also they were not deteriorated by electrical stress because the breakdown voltages of coils at the line side were lower than at the earth side. Therefore, some changes of the electrical properties in the nondestructive test seemed to result from thermal effects. As mentioned above, it is proved that solventless resin-impregnated mica insulation systems have kept good electrical properties in service for over ten years."
"A few formulas available for calculating the conductivity of combinations of solid dielectrics could also be used to evaluate the conductivity of mixtures of liquid dielectrics. However, they have certain limitations in the sense that they can only be used over a limited range of volumetric proportions, particularly so when one of the liquids in the mixture is highly lossy. In this paper, formulas are proposed, which result in predictable values that are in conformity with the measured values over a comparatively wide range of volumetric proportions. The authors have derived formulas elsewhere for predicting the loss factor and dielectric constant of a mixture of two low-loss liquid dielectrics. In this paper, a mixture of two liquids, one of which is highly lossy, is also considered. All measurements have been made on three typical mixtures consisting of transformer oil as base and cottonseed oil, castor oil, and ethyl alcohol (ethanol) as additives."
"Reported values given by different observers for the enthalpy of cation vacancy migration in alkali halides show a much greater spread than might be expected from the quoted instrumental accuracies. The customary types of electrodes used in this kind of investigation have therefore been examined in terms of durability and the repeatability and linearity of the results obtained using them. A type of electrode is described which gives superior performance in these respects to that usually reported. A careful determination of defect energies from ionic conductivity measurements in NaCl was undertaken using this electrode arrangement, and the results are compared with those quoted by other investigators."

"Experiments have been carried out to investigate the breakdown mechanism in Perspex over a temperature range from 20 to 160°C, using impulse voltages of widely differing rise times. The electric strength was found to be sensitive to voltage rise time, reaching a maximum as the rise time is increased, but falling again at longer rise times towards the dc value. The results are discussed in terms of a model in which space charges accumulate at the electrodes, positive charges at the anode, and negative charges at the cathode."
"After examining the life-testing theories for both thermal and electrical aging, a new theory, starting from an extension of the chemical reaction one, is proposed. However, the new theory is quite different from the latter, because it ignores the aging mechanism, considering only its effects. Through this theory, electrical aging is investigated and the fundamental law governing the time behavior of electrical insulation is derived on the hypothesis that the voltage-life law has the form of an inverse-power law. This result suggests a new procedure for the voltage endurance test. Short-time dielectric strength of specimens, prestressed for different times by an ac voltage of the same value, is measured and plotted against the aging time. Using this procedure a great deal of information about the time behavior of insulating materials can be obtained in a short time. Experimental data, pertinent to plastic insulating materials for medium-and high-voltage cables, are given in support of the theory. Since the theory proposed is quite general, it can be extended to the study of aging in other systems subject to degradation."
"The formation of Lichtenberg figures on aluminum and titanium electrodes covered by oxide and nitride layers while being exposed to high vacuum and 100-kV (rms) 60-Hz voltage is recorded. The observations were made in the course of research on high-voltage vacuum insulation for cryocables. The Lichtenberg figures have several technological implications. They provide evidence for the occurrence of 1) focused ion beams, and 2) tangential discharges in the adsorbed layer of gas on the vacuum side of dielectric coverings on metal conductors. As Lichtenberg figures can only be produced by fast high-voltage pulses, they prove that the discharge duration was short compared with the period of the 60-Hz voltage wave."
"The combination of a low-loss polymer film with a low-loss impregnating oil does not always give a low-loss composite insulation, particularly when the system is aged under simultaneous thermal and voltage stress. This anomalous behavior appears to be related to a loss phenomenon at the oil-to-polymer interface. For the combination of fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) film and polybutene oil a remarkable reduction in dissipation factor was achieved by increasing the degree of wetting at the interface. This was brought about by modifications tending to increase the surface energy of the solid (polymer) and to decrease the surface tension of the liquid (oil). The resulting system gave low and stable dissipation factors on extended aging and, in addition, did not show loss peaks as a function of voltage as observed on the original insulation."
"The application and interpretation of partial discharge measurements on HV coil insulation are discussed. When internal partial discharges are developed in an insulation system containing voids, rapid changes in voltage distribution over the solid and gaseous dielectrics take place. The measured total changes in charge transfer and losses of the insulation are probably more dependent on the dielectric properties and configuration of the solid than on the actual corona discharge pulses occurring in the voids. Therefore, the analysis and interpretation of partial discharge test data must be based on a complete knowledge of the insulation systems and its intended function in a rotating machine. A better understanding of the effects of internal ionization in HV coils can only be gained by functional endurance testing at voltages above corona inception points. Quality control methods for HV coil insulation systems and control standards must be based on such experiences."

 "Pulses of conduction current in transformer oil under high electrical fields were studied by recording them on magnetic tapes and then subjecting them to pulse-height analysis. It was found that for the degassed oil, small-magnitude pulses increased, whereas large-magnitude ones decreased with the duration of the stress conditioning period. With air dissolved in the oil, pulses of all magnitudes decreased during stress conditioning. The electrode material affected the current pulses only at relatively low stresses. The pulses were found to be sensitive to hydrostatic pressure only for relatively large gaps at high applied fields. The results support the theory that a gaseous phase is involved at some stage in the breakdown process of liquids."
"The results of measurements of the electric field near the surface of stainless-steel electrodes in vacuum are described. It is found that the field is modified by a solid insulator bridging the interelectrode gap. The extrapolated cathode field is enhanced sufficiently to equal the value considered necessary to initiate break-down in a plane vacuum gap. The measured fields are greater than the applied field and consistent with the accumulation of positive surface charge on the solid insulator. Analysis of the data suggests that the surface charge results from bombardment of the surface by electrons emitted at the insulator-cathode junction."
"The effects of the pulse duration of applied field and electrode geometry on the thermal-breakdown phenomenon have been studied by applying pulsed high-frequency field (1-10 MHz) with variable duration (10-1000, μs) to the silicone liquids immersed in the rod-plane electrodes (approximate uniform field) and the needle-plane electrodes (extreme nonuniform field), considering the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity of silicone. It has been found that the thermal breakdown due to dielectric heating occurs when the field is applied for less than a millisecond. Thermal breakdown explains the experimental results in which the breakdown strength decreases in the rod-plane electrodes with increasing pulse duration and electrode separation, but is little influenced in the needle-plane electrodes by these same variables."
"A simple apparatus is described for the measurement of resistivity of dielectric powders at elevated temperatures. MgO powder is tested in the range of temperatures from room temperature to 500°C. A large decrease of resistivity is observed at about 50°C, which is in contrast to a previously reported decrease of resistivity in single crystals of MgO at much lower temperatures. The iron content in the samples of typical purity is sufficient to cause a significant lowering of the activation energy for conduction in MgO, but it is not clear why the increased conduction occurs in a narrow range of temperatures."
"A methodical variation of the radius of curvature of the electrode reveals interesting electrical breakdown properties of the sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) which may be useful to the designer of high-voltage apparatus. The pressure range under consideration was 1-5 kg/Cm2 absolute. The tests were performed under 60-Hz voltages. For a given electrode configuration and a specified operation voltage, there exists a region for the value of the radius of curvature within which flashover occurs. At high pressures this region may be restricted to a narrow zone of low values of the radius of curvature. Very sharp electrodes usually lie outside of this region. The field in the hemispherically capped rod-plane is analyzed by the finite-element method for values of d/r between 0.8-40. The critical field was found, at high pressures, to tend towards a constant value, which is that prevailing under uniform-field conditions irrespective of radius of curvature."
"The corona inception and the sparking potentials of dry air are measured in the pressure range 25×10-3-760 torr using two separate coaxial electrode systems. The similarity theorem for the sparking potential is obeyed when the central electrode is made to have a positive-voltage polarity over the range 10-3 < pR1 < 0.3 torr m. For the negative polarity of the inner electrode, the similarity theorem is found not to hold. The measured coronainception potential is compared with the values obtained from the theories of Werner and Townsend. It is found that the Townsend theory for calculating the corona-inception potential gives better agreement with the experimental results, as it makes no restrictive assumptions concerning the discharge parameters. At a fixed gas pressure, the sparking potential for the positive wire is higher than that for the negative polarity of the same electrode in the range 100-375 torr. As the pressure is increased further, the positive breakdown potential decreases below the corresponding value for the negative breakdown. This phenomenon is shown to be due to the role of the negative-ion space charge which is present when the central electrode is made negative."

 "In order to determine the typical levels of radio frequency and microwave radiation that result from man-made sources in an urban environment, measurements were made of peak power densities in the Washington, D.C., area during the summer of 1969. Radiation levels were monitored over the frequency range from 20 Hz to 10 GHz at ten sites within a 25 mile radius of the city. Experimental accuracy can be estimated at ±10 dB. The highest levels measured (approximately 10-2 mW/cm2) originated primarily from AM broadcast towers and airport radar installations. These values fall 30 dB below any published U.S. recommendations for occupational exposure."
"Short-term predictions of operational characteristics of ionospheric radio communication such as MUF, atmospheric noise, etc., are likely to lead to more efficient use of the HF spectrum. There are no techniques available for the short-term predictions of atmospheric noise so far. The paper describes two techniques for the purpose viz., autocorrelation technique and source location technique. The former predicts the noise level at a specified hour from the measurement at an earlier hour since atmospheric noise level variations constitute a Markov process. The latter predicts the noise level by predicting the type of the day from the characteristics observed at 16 hrs. Prediction accuracies are discussed, and the possibility of refinements is investigated. Possible system applications are discussed, and a typical calculation is carried out which shows that economies in the radiated power of the order of 10 dB are possible."
"Electrical and electronic equipment must often be protected against external interference. Accordingly, metal shields are used against microwave radiation, electromagnetic effects, etc. Conducting materials, impregnated with elastic substances, are also used in many cases. The present paper deals with the performance of such a cylindrical shield, including a reference to shielding effectiveness. It is shown that with the assumed model the shield is pervious along its axis over a spectrum of frequencies."
"The electromagnetic field penetration through small apertures is discussed for general aperture shapes. Approximnate analytical expressions are obtained for the penetration fields. In particular the fields that penetrate a small aperture into the region between two parallel, perfectly conducting plates are determined and some numerical results are obtained."
"A simple method is described for calculating and plotting strong bounds on the frequency spectra of linear frequency modulated (LFM) pulses used in CHIRP radar transmitters. Bounds on the voltage density (amplitude), energy density, power density, or power spectrum can be hand calculated and plotted in 10 to 20 minutes with a computational accuracy that is adequate for most electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) analyses. The bounds obtained are within one dB of the peaks of the central lobe and major sidelobes. The method is based on the fact that the bounds on the far sidelobes are essentially the same whether or not the pulse is LFM. Several numerical examples are given for Hamming-weighted and trapezoidal pulses. The method is a convenient mathematical tool for engineers involved in compatibility analysis or concerned with radar transmitters complying with military standards pertaining to EMC."

 "In terms of network parameters defined at the input terminals, expressions applicable to any array configuration are derived for the S/N ratio. The formulation is made in such a way that it becomes possible to account for coupling effects that arise from the geometry of the array and the current distributions on the elements of the array. Since the S/N ratio consists of the ratio of two Hermitians forms, known techniques are used for its optimization. Comparisons with simplified theories are given that demonstrate clearly the importance of mutual coupling in many cases. Numerical results for a 4-element circular array are included for two idealized noise temperature distributions. Applications of this theory to EMC fields are also mentioned."
"Multiple sets of incidental man-made radio noise data assembled from many sources are examined to determine their variation with frequency and distance. Separate treatments are provided for both average noise power and quasipeak noise field intensity data. The frequency and distance variations of average noise power are examined within the intervals 500 kHz to 1 GHz and 1 to 23 miles from an urban center. At several urban separation distances the frequency dependence of quasi-peak noise field intensity is presented for a large portion of the frequency interval between 15 kHz and 400 MHz."
"A modified form of the Biot-Savart law is derived which is of particular use in the calculation and/or graphical determination of the magnetic fields due to line currents. In a linear conductor carrying a uniform current, I, the magnetic intensity at an observation point is given by \\begin{equation*}H = \\frac{2I}{R}{sin}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\end{equation*} where α is the viewing angle to the conductor extremities and R is the effective distance measured from the observation point to the conductor along the viewing angle bisector. Examples of the application of this formula are given. These illustrate the usefulness of the formula in simplifying EMC analyses involving circuit and system emanations."
"Measurements of power line conducted interference voltages are commonly made throughout the 150 kHz to 30 MHz frequency range on military, industrial, and consumer equipment using line impedance stabilization networks (LISN) and, more recently, current probe techniques. This paper presents some brief background information concerning power line conducted interference measurements and the results of a study to assess the effects of LISN and current probe measurement devices on the level of measured conducted interference. A model is defined which facilitates prediction of the effects. The model concept allows the procedures described in this paper to be extended to equipment of other impedance definitions. A comparison of the calculated and empirical differences is made and suggests an analytical approach in sizing the effects upon the conducted interference levels."
"EMC specifications consider two kinds of signals (broad band and narrow band). Special care is to be taken to determine the nature of the signal if meaningful measurements are desired. Tests specified in MIL-STD-462 and in other EMC specifications to decide if there are narrow-band or broad-band emissions are not conclusive, and many times it is difficult to make a decision about the nature of the signal. The decision is less difficult to make when bandwidth effects are understood. This paper tries to show the implications of performing EMC measurements using different receiver bandwidths. It appears that broad-band measurements are valid only in the special case in which the signal has a continuous flat frequency spectrum; in the other cases their meaning is rather questionable. In the conclusion some remarks are made in order to clarify this difficult situation."
"With the Fourier transform \\begin{equation*}F(\\omega)=\\int^{+\\infty}_{-\\infty}f(t)\\text{exp}({-j}\\omega{t})dt\\end{equation*} it is not difficult to evaluate a good approximation of the envelope of F(w) simply by maximizing the integral in the second member of the preceding equation.

"Over recent years increased effort has been applied to scientific research in the Antarctic. This growth has resulted in increased scientific and logistics activity at McMurdo Station, the principal U.S. base. As a consequence contamination of the natural environment has become a problem. A particular example of this contamination is interference to communications receivers and sensitive scientific measuring equipment by radio noise. In November 1970 a survey of radio noise levels near McMurdo was conducted to evaluate the possibility of establishing a low-noise experimental station for the operation of sensitive experiments. The instrument used in the survey, a Stoddart NM-25T, was not sensitive enough to measure the atmospheric noise levels at extremely quiet sites, but was suitable for determining the man-made levels near the base. In central McMurdo the man-made levels, which are mainly attributable to power line noise, are about 45 dB greater than the atmospheric levels expected for the area. Furthermore, they are about 60 dB greater than the man-made levels recorded near another Antarctic base. For the McMurdo area to continue to be used for the operation of sensitive equipment some control must be imposed on the installation and operation of equipment that generates noise."
"Probability distributions of peaks on atmospheric radio noise were investigated by recording noise bursts over their complete dynamic range of about 75 dB. The investigations were made at a large number of frequencies, with a large number of bandwidths and above different datum levels to enhance the utility of the results. Probability distributions of peaks were found to follow a single log-normal distribution or a combination of two or more log-normals irrespective of the frequency, bandwidth, and the datum level. The standard deviation of distributions was found to range from 2 to 22 dB. Reasons for such a wide range of standard deviations are given.The composite distributions degenerate into a single log-normal distribution when the datum level is raised sufficiently indicating that the higher and lower amplitude peaks arise from separate sources. The results have been compared with the similar published work corresponding to different latitudes, frequency ranges, and bandwidths and possible reasons for the observed differences are offered."
"Experimental and theoretical data show that a new compact lightning arrestor can be incorporated into a multipin connector housing to protect components in missile, aircraft, and ground systems from lightning energy. This energy is sometimes transmitted into component compartments causing component burnout, ignition of explosives, and circuit malfunctions. By properly incorporating the lightning arrestor-connector, these effects can be minimized or eliminated. The lightning arrestor-connector concept has been analyzed, and prototype devices have been tested extensively at Sandia Laboratories. Production for use in several missile systems has begun. The design and initial development of the device is described along with data demonstrating the device behavior under simulated lightning tests."
"Antennas in the proximity of complicated conducting structures such as aircraft, submarines, missiles, and satellites have, in general, analytically unpredictable impedance characteristics due to coupling effects between the antennas and these structures. As a model of the fuselage of these conducting structures, a conducting cylinder of finite length is considered and an analytic-numerical technique is used to compute the impedance characteristics of a nearby linear dipole of arbitrary length."
"An analysis to determine the response of an impedance-loaded transmission line configuration excited by a plane-polarized electric field of arbitrary spatial orientation has been needed for a long time. The purpose of the present paper is to meet this need by suggesting a method of solution based on the analysis of the simplest of such circuits: an impedance-terminated two-conductor transmission line. The theory is based on the use of the Rayleigh-Carson reciprocity theorem."
"The problem considered is that of a multiple conductor transmission line with arbitrarily positioned impedances in series with each wire. The objective is to determine the currents in each of the loads in terms of the amplitude of the incident electric field. The groundwork is laid in this paper for a very general theory for N wire structures when the impedances are situated at the centers of the conductors. If the load elements are in echelon rather than centrally positioned, it appears necessary to abandon the simultaneous integral equation approach employed and resort to the use of two network theorems: superposition and compensation. It is demonstrated that the results depend on a synthesis of antenna and transmission line behavior. This work is an extension to the theory of end-loaded conductors published previously in the G-EMC TRANSACTIONS."
"A coaxial line having a small aperture in the sheath and terminating in arbitrary impedances is considered to be illuminated by an incident plane wave. The excitation of currents in the termination impedances is shown to depend upon three independent factors. Simple analytical forms are given for equivalent voltage and current sources of the aperture excitation."
"A general theory is developed for determining the current in the load impedance of any slot configuration in terms of the current in the load impedance of the complementary strip (wire) circuit. It is assumed that these duals are illuminated by plane wave electromagnetic fields. Following establishment of the procedures and techniques for analysis of strip and slot circuits, the practical situation presented by a bomb in the open bomb bay of an aircraft with load impedance connected between one end of the weapon and fuselage is treated. The load current is found approximately when the incident plane wave electric field is polarized in both transverse and longitudinal directions with respect to a strip that is equivalent electrically to a specific right circular cylinder that represents the weapon."
"A common error is made by antenna engineers in the calculation of the load current in monopole (and slot) receiving antennas. The mistake is to assume that the open circuit voltage at the terminals of the monopole is precisely one-half the open-circuit voltage of the equivalent dipole. It is shown in this paper by physical reasoning, as well as analytical argument, that the open-circuit voltages of both structures are identical. It is particularly important in dealing with receiving antennas over a ground plane not to neglect the image source that effectively doubles the field acting on the receiving configuration."
"It is shown that the complete set of circular shift invariants called the Q-spectrum, of the Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT) of a periodic sequence is related to the cyclic autocorrelation of the given sequence through the Hadamard matrices. It is also shown that the modified WHT (MWHT) of the cyclic autocorrelation yields the Q-spectrum within some scale factors. This is analogous to the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) case, i.e., the DFT of the autocorrelation of a sequence yields the shift invariant power spectrum. The Q-spectrum can be computed efficiently using the MWHT rather than the WHT. A physical interpretation for the Q-spectrum is also provided. The motivation for this study is to show that while the WHT is inherently associated with the notion of dyadic time shifts, it does have analogous properties with respect to cyclic time shifts."
"In solving problems of multiconductor antenna transmission lines excited by an incident plane wave electromagnetic field, it is necessary to separate the antenna mode from the transmission line modes. This is accomplished by suitably transforming the definite integrals that occur in the theory. The purpose of this correspondence is to explain in a meticulous manner how this is achieved."
"The directivity patterns of a curtain array used in HF communication systems were calculated in the past on the assumption of sinusoidal current distribution. Since this assumption is not justified by the modern theory, there is a need to revise these calculations. Some experimental results which were not understood earlier also provide support for this view."

"With the advent of the U.S. Navy's proposed ELF Communications System (Sanguine System), which would use an earth-return circuit to excite the earth-ionosphere cavity, earth-return current coupling into power systems has become important. The theoretical basis for coupling into power distribution systems is developed. A comparison is made between measured and predicted values of the induced voltage. Techniques which are useful in eliminating the effects of the induced voltage are described. The effectiveness of these interference mitigation techniques is demonstrated by comparing measurements on actual systems. Finally, data on power system interference are developed for use in communication system design tradeoff studies."
"To mitigate the inductive interference on telephone lines exposed to the electromagnetic environment generated by the SANGUINE System, the commercial telephone plant located in the vicinity of an experimental ELF antenna system in Wisconsin was modified by using neutralizing transformers. Compatible operation of telephone system during SANGUINE operation is assured by this technique as evidenced by the continuing virtually interference-free performance of the modified plant."
"The theory for predicting the coupling between long line earth-return circuits and extremely low-frequency earth-return sources is reviewed. This theory is based on a uniform earth model. The electric fields predicted by this theory are then compared to a sampling of experimental data derived from long probe wire measurements."
"The design procedure of a new synchronous counter type of Walsh function generator for the generation of a set of Walsh functions with the least possible error in orthogonality is developed. Each flip-flop of the counter generates synchronously one particular Walsh function in the interval 1 of normalized time during one cycle of counting. The usual design procedures for synchronous counters are not applicable because of the large number of logic variables. Using a two-dimensional plot of the enabling inputs, it turns out that the T flip-flop is the most suitable type. It is shown that by using the symmetry properties of the enabling input patterns for a generator consisting of n T flip-flops, only (log2 n)- 1 standard time sequences, from which the remaining could be derived, need be generated. These time sequences can be easily obtained by decoding the outputs of those flip-flops generating the subset of Rademacher functions. The procedure is illustrated by taking an example of the generation of the first 16 Walsh functions."
"We show that the reference for the measurement of the shielding performance of a cable sheath should be the sheath current. However, unless the phase length of the cable is short, the response at the ends of the line will be sensitive to frequency even if the sheath current is uniform, and the coaxial line formed by the core wires and the sheath is matched at both ends. This is because the driving field in the coaxial line and the waves that it generates have different phase speeds and directions. We present supporting experimental data. Because of this effect it is not meaningful simply to state that a cable provides a specifled attenuation, except for a cable that is short at the highest frequency of interest. We discuss the effects of connectors and of cracks or holes in the sheath. Because the total leakage is proportional to the sum of leakages through the sheath (the connectors and the cracks) and not to their product, it is necessary to assign these contributions with some arbitrariness in order to compare them in decibels. We give an example that shows the importance of RF-tight connectors."
"The surface transfer impedances (STI) of several flexible subminiature coaxial cables, such as RG-174/U and RG-188/U, plus smaller coaxial shielded wires, were measured to determine EM shielding characteristics. The results cover the frequency range 0.1-50 MHz and correlate well with previous theoretical models and with experimental values for larger cables, such as RG-58. Copperbraided subminiature cables had STI values 2-5 times larger than those for RG-58"
"The way the spectrum is committed through the processes of allocation and assignment has a definite bearing on spectrum utilization. Both processes are stochastic in nature and nearly irreversible. Decisions are made with respect to each applicant as time progresses without knowing the requirements of future applicants, and it is difficult, if not impossible, to revoke or change an assignment once given. This paper examines the frequency assignment game to determine the effect of assignment strategy on spectrum utilization, and to define the principle underlying the development of optimum strategies. The results of this investigation show that there is an effect of strategy, that the effect bears on spectrum utilization, that there is an optimum strategy, and that there are some very useful near-optimum ones as well. Finally, there is evidence that we may not be doing things quite the right way, and some recommendations are offered."

 "In this paper some basic concepts involved in efficient orbit/spectrum utilization for broadcast satellites are discussed. A theoretical analysis leads to the determination of interference zones and minimum number of frequency channels required for homogeneous systems operating in the 800-MHz and 12-GHz bands. A crossed-beam arrangement of satellite systems is proposed, in which the beams from satellites to service areas cross each other. This arrangement has a more efficient orbit spectrum utilization compared to the identical-longitude approach, in which the subsatellite point has the same longitude as the center of the service area, Based upon practical considerations, the elemental number of frequency channels required for world-wide coverage has been calculated in relation to satellite orbital position, for single-beam and multibeam satellite systems, using the identical-longitude and crossed -beam arrangements."
"In the past several years growing emphasis on the environment has generated a minor revolution in the field of air quality instrumentation. New instruments have been appearing steadily and will no doubt continue to do so in the near future. While this new generation of instrumentation is being field tested, refined, and applied to air quality measurement problems, development of more sensitive and versatile techniques continues. This paper gives an overview of the new generation of air quality monitoring instruments, comparing them with some more traditional methods."
"In order to stabilize the altitude calculation in an inertial navigation system, an altimeter is commonly used. In a conventional local-level mechanization, this is generally accomplished by correcting the vertical channel integrators with the difference between the inertial system and altimeter indication of vertical position. However, in a space-stable system the procedure is not as clear since a vertical channel is not physically present. Three altitude damping mechanizations for a space-stable inertial navigation system are proposed. The equivalent local-level mechanizations are then found by comparing error propagation equations in a common coordinate frame."
"Seven filter algorithms were presented in a recent survey paper [2], and were compared computationally (operations count) when relatively few observations were to be processed. These algorithms are elaborated further in this paper. Details of the computations are presented, and it is shown that for problems with even moderately large amounts of data, the information matrix and square-root information matrix formulations are computationally more efficient than the other methods considered (conventional Kalman, stabilized Kalman, and square-root covariance mechanizations). It is pointed out that Schmidt's matrix factorization-Householder transformation technique leads to the same equations as those obtained via Potter's method. Several improvements in the equation mechanization are given."
"The design of a high-accuracy digital VOR signal generator is described. The main part of the generator is formed of three digital sinewave generators, one of which is frequency modulated. The equations needed to design these generators are given and the practical realization based on read-only memories is described."
"The signal enhancement properties of a single-loop delayline integrator (DLI) are derived for operation in the presence of correlated noise. The signal is assumed periodic with a period equal to the delay of the DLI and present only for a finite time interval. The noise is assumed additive, zero mean, statistically independent from the signal, and present for an infinite time. The noise also is assumed covariance stationary with a specified auto correlation function. Enhancement is defined as the ratio of the increase in average signal power to the increase in average noise power due to integration. The results are general in that the enhancement is derived in terms of the autocorrelation coefficients of the input noise. Plots of enhancement versus number of signal observations and feedback gain are shown for uncorrelated and exponentially correlated noise. The plots show graphically the optimum choices of feedback gain and number of signal observations for a specified auto correlation function and signal observation time. When strongly correlated noise, characteristic of 10-GHz backscatter from salt flats at low incidence angles, rather than uncorrelated noise is assumed present at the input of the DLI, an example, using DLI parameters typical of modern airborne radars, shows a degradation in the maximum achievable enhancement of 9 dB."
"A small additional loss for radar range calculations at low grazing angles is described. This loss results because the variation in atmospheric refraction versus altitude makes the atmosphere act like a lens, causing thinning of radar signal energy to and from the target, independent of frequency. The magnitude of loss is derived and is plotted versus grazing angle and range. The maximum two-way loss, occurring at zero degrees grazing angle and a range well beyond the atmosphere, is 2.9 dB."
"The objectives of this paper are two. The first is to show that a gated phase-locked loop (GPLL) is a tracking device whose operation approximates that of a maximum likelihood estimator of the phase of a pulsed sinusoid imbedded in noise. The second is to determine the behavior of theb loop in the presence of noise. It is found that the loop performance is equivalent to that of a continuous phase-locked loop driven by the same noise, plus a continuous sinusoid which has the same power as the pulsed sinusoid at the input of the GPLL."
"The general problem of repetitively switched circuits is solved in closed form using a matrix formalism and eigenvalue techniques. The method is similar to that used in treating alternating gradient focusing in modern accelerators. As a simple example, this method is applied to a dc-dc converter power supply."
"Approximate nonlinear filtering theory is applied to the estimation of vehicle position and velocity in three demensions using sequential range measurements to three known locations. The particular case studied is a satellite air traffic control system which utilizes range measurements to two geostationary satellites and an altitude measurement. Three approximate filters are examined as suboptimal realizations of the minimum-variance filter and simulation results are presented to show that simple first-order approximation is an adequate representation. The parametric relationship between state covariance, measurement noise, vehicle maneuver structure, data rate, and system geometry is presented."
"This paper presents an adaptive estimation algorithm for bit synchronization, assuming that the parameters of the incoming data process are time varying. The data are linearly related to the state variable to be determined. By employing the Gauss-Markov theorem, the optimal recursive estimate (including the nonstationary property of the system), which is a matrix operation on the transformed data, is obtained. The efficiency of the estimator is measured by the amount of data required and the speed of convergence. Both of these have proved to be of satisfactory and acceptable quality."
"Automatic detection radars require some method of adapting to variations in the background clutter in order to control their false-alarm rate. Conventional cell-averaging techniques designed to maintain a constant false-alarm rate in Rayleigh clutter will fail to control the false-alarm rate in more severe clutter environments such as log-normal or Weibull clutter. A processor is described which is capable of maintaining false-alarm regulation in log-normal clutter and in Weibull clutter (and, under certain conditions, over the entire family of log-normal and Weibull distributions)."
"Approximate expressions are derived for the video clutter spectra in the receiver of a low pulse repetition frequency (PRF), airborne moving target indicator (AMTI), pulse-Doppler radar for both step-scanning and continuous-scanning antennas. The receiver is assumed to process the received waveform with a clutter-tracking oscillator and a window function is employed to obtain short-term spectra. Except for the broadening effects of the window function, it is shown that the clutter spectrum can be simply related to the antenna voltage-gain pattern. It is further shown, in the scanning antenna case, that the combined spectral broadening due to platform motion and antenna scanning cannot be assumed to be the result of the convolution of the separate effects unless the antenna gain pattern has a Gaussian shape. The approximate clutter expressions are illustrated by examples and are shown to agree well with the results of computer calculations."
"The influence of sudden increases of electron content on the accurate determination of the position of a satellite is investigated based on a spherically stratified ionospheric model.

 "Efficient coding of continuous speech signals for digital representation has attracted much interest in recent years. The underlying aim of efficient coding methods is to reduce the channel capacity required to represent a signal to meet a specific reconstruction fidelity criterion. To achieve this objective, modern speech data compression techniques rely on two very similar procedures. One procedure uses predictive deconvolution which subtracts from the current signal value that portion which can be predicted from its past and thus removes redundancy in the speech by removing sequential correlation. The signal thus requires fewer bits for equivalent quantization error. The second procedure involves identification of a complete mathematical model of the speech producing mechanism. This involves determination of the characteristics of the source that drives this transfer function. Data reduction is again achieved since the rate of change of the parameters of the speech model is much smaller than the rate of change of the speech waveform. This paper develops these data reduction procedures in terms of modern estimation theory, specifically a Kalman filter model, and illustrates the utility of this model as an analysis tool by means of an example based on a uniform tube which provides a qualitative assessment of the potential of the technique for application to real speech signals."
"This paper deals with the application of modern estimation techniques to the problem of speech data rate reduction. It is desirable to adaptively identify and quantitize the parameters of the speech model. These paramaters cannot be identified and quantized exactly; the performance of the predictor is thereby degraded and this could prevent data reduction. In many cases it is desirable to emply a suboptimal predictor in order to simplify the algorithms, and predictor performance is again degraded. This paper develops sensitivity and error analysis as a potential method for determining quantitatively how speech data reduction system performance is degraded by imprecise parameter knowledge or suboptimal filtering. An intended use of the sensitivity and error analysis algorithms is to determine parameter identification and model structure requirements of configuration concepts for adaptive speech digitizers. First, sensitivity and error analysis algorithms are presented that form the basis for the remainder of the work. The algorithms are then used to determine how imprecise knowledge of vocal tract parameters degrades predictor performance in speech. Transversal filters have previously been proposed for this application. The sensitivity analysis algorithms are then used to determine when and by how much the transverse filter is suboptimal to the Kalman filter. In particular, the question of how effectively a higher order of all-pole model approximates a system with zeros is answered, as this question is of considerable importance in speech. Finally, the physical significance of the innovations process in speech data rate reduction is studied."
"Consider a uniform train of M coherent short pulses transmitted by a radar and received with a Doppler shift. When thermal noise is present, let the mth sample of the return at the video be represented by the complex process Zm. A novel detection and Doppler estimation criterion is analyzed which depends on the semicoherent statistic \\begin{equation*}{Z_{K}}^\\prime = \\sum_{m=k+1}^{M} {^{z}m^{z}m-k}^{ *}\\end{equation*} where the asterisk stands for complex conjugate. Its characteristics are also studied when the real and imaginary parts of Zm are digitized to one bit."
"The number of transmitted pulses associated with the Doppler histories of a side-looking radar may greatly exceed the desired azimuth compression ratio of the system. This discrepancy is taxing if the storage required for the azimuth processing is provided by cores, magnetic drums, and the like. Thus, as a practical matter, one considers presumming of the data prior to correlation in an attempt to achieve the desired performance with a minimum amount of digital storage. In this paper, the optimum (in terms of resolution) presummer is derived, along with the optimum apportionment of the available storage capacity between the presumming and correlation operations. Under the condition (or generally pessimistic approximation) that the illumination pattern of the antenna uniformly illuminates a Doppler bandwidth equal to the PRF of the radar, the optimum presumming coefficients are the first Np Fourier coefficients of a function which is one of the Doppler bandwidth to be correlated and zero on the remainder of the PRF bandwidth, where Np is the number of transmitted radar pulses over which presumming is provided. Increasing Np reduces the degradation due to presumming, but may leave inadequate storage for correlation. Hence, we optimize the apportionment between the two operations and present the obtainable resolution as a function of total storage and the number of transmitted pulses in the received Doppler history."
"This paper describes the materials and methods of construction of fuel and oil quantity sensors designed to be used in the severe environments of todays high-performance aircraft. The sensors are based on the use of magnetically activated reed switches suitably compensated by resistors. In order to provide physical and electrical protection, the switches and resistors are encapsulated in a fuel and oil resistant electrical insulation formed of alternate layers of polyimide film and compatible fluorocarbon polymers."
"A minimax filter is derived to estimate the state of a system, using observations corrupted by colored noise, when large uncertainties in the plant dynamics and process noise are present."
"All tracking systems suffer, to some extent, from signal level fluctuations. The signal fluctuations are modeled by a Gaussian process and the noise performance of both linear and nonlinear first-order tracking systems is considered. In the nonlinear case, the Ito versus Stratonovich calculus difficulty arises, but it is resolved to make sense physically. Several analytical results are obtained which are useful in analyses of tracking systems."
"The design of adaptive filters for the tracking of high-performance maneuvering targets is a fundamental problem in real-time surveillance systems. As is well known, a filter which provides heavy smoothing can not accurately track an evasive maneuver, and conversely. Consequently, one is led to the consideration of adaptive methods of filter design. This paper presents an improved self-adaptive filter algorithm for on-line solution of the above problem. Basically, this algorithm utilizes the orthogonality property of the residual time series to force the filter to automatically track the optimal gain levels in a changing environment."
"A simple Markov process model of binary, digitized radar clutter returns is assumed. Probability distributions for the number of hits in n observations are developed for small n with a binary parameter describing the process derived for Rayleigh distributed clutter. Tables of distributions are included, along with an example to show the effects of correlation on the false-alarm probabilities of a sliding-window detector."
"This paper discusses the application of least-mean-squares approximate inverse filtering techniques to radar range sidelobe reduction. The method is illustrated by application to the 13-element Barker code. The performance of the least-mean-square inverse filter is compared with the matched filter and with the simplified sidelobereducing filters of Rihaczek and Golden. A filter which completely suppresses the range sidelobes of a 13-element Barker sequence is only 0.2 dB worse than a matched filter in noise."
"This paper describes automatic monitoring equipment built in to a precision tracking radar system to detect and isolate faults. The purpose of the monitoring equipment is to minimize the mean time to repair faults and to exercise the overall system for pre-mission alignment and calibration. In addition, it is used to periodically check for performance degradation in key areas of the system. The paper describes the design approach used to meet the above requirements. Three types of signals are monitored: analog, digital, and switch closure. A list of each type is given and the technique used to monitor each is described. The design approach for pre-mission alignment and calibration is outlined. Tests performed are: RF alignment of the boresight axis, range tracking accuracy, angle servo calibration and accuracy, and receiver figure of merit measurements."
"A brief review is given of some of the problems concerning the interactions of electromagnetic radiation with biological systems. It is emphasized that we cannot continue to expand the use and power of the electromagnetic spectrum without adequate consideration of its possible biological effects. New research efforts must be started in this area, utilizing a strong and well-coordinated interdisciplinary approach."
"In the design of a tracking filter for air traffic control (ATC) applications, a maneuvering aircraft can be modelled by a linear system with random noise accelerations. A Kalman filter tracker, designed on the basis of a variance chosen according to the distribution of the potential maneuver accelerations, will maintain track during maneuvers and provide some improvement in position accuracy. However, during those portions of the flight path where the aircraft is not maneuvering, the tracking accuracy will not be as good as if no acceleration noise had been allowed in the tracking filter. In this paper, statistical decision theory is used to derive an optimal test for detecting the aircraft maneuver; a more practical suboptimal test is then deduced from the optimal test. As long as no maneuver is declared, a simpler filter, based on a constant-velocity model, is used to track the aircraft. When a maneuver is detected, the tracker is reinitialized using stored data, up-dated to the present time, and then normal tracking is resumed as new data arrives. In essence, the tracker performs on the basis of a piecewise linear model in which the breakpoints are defined on-line using the maneuver detector. Simulation results show that there is a significant improvement in tracking capability using the decision-directed adaptive tracker."
"This paper reviews the principles of adaptive radar in which both the spatial (antenna pattern) and temporal (Doppler filter) responses of the system are controlled adaptively. An adaptive system senses the angular-Doppler distribution of the external noise field and adjusts a set of radar parameters for maximum signal-to-interference ratio and optimum detection performance. A gradient technique for control of the radar array/filter weights is described and shown to generate weights which asymptotically approach optimum values. Simulation results illustrate the convergence rate of adaptive systems and the performance improvement which can be achieved."
"This paper presents a new concept of high-reliability strapdown attitude sensing systems for space vehicles. Each system utilizes a set of redundant two-degree-of-freedom gyros. An optimum system configuration is obtained for maximum system reliability and the best measurement accuracy. Improved accuracy of the final data is obtained by using the least-square data reduction technique. Each system possesses a \"sensor performance management\" feature which is capable of failure detection, faulty gyro identification, system reconfiguration, and, possibly, sensor recalibration. Improvement in reliability, as compared to other types of strapdown systems, is demonstrated. Details of the development are described in terms of a system containing four gyros."
"The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that an adaptive array can be used to acquire weak signals, whose direction and timing are unknown, in an environment of stronger jammers. Specifically, it is shown that in an environment of one weak signal and one strong jammer, the adaptive array output suppresses the strong jammer below the weak signal by roughly the same amount that the jammer exceeded the signal before adaptation."
"This paper considers a novel attitude stabilizing system which acts both as a passive nutation damper and a momentum source for an Earth-orbiting satellite. The system may be designed to use four identical wheels mounted coaxially with and at the ends of the arms of a cruciform structure. The structure may then be spun about the axis perpendicular to the arms to provide angular momentum along the spacecraft spin axis. The wheels experience torques produced by inertial forces. The necessary damping and restoring (spring) torques are provided by means of a torsional arrangement built around the center of each wheel. The performance characteristics of the proposed stabilizing unit are evaluated by considering spacecraft parameters used in one phase of development of the Communications Technology Satellite (CTS). The results obtained for a specific design of the stabilizer indicate that global stability of the desired attitude motion of the spacecraft can be guaranteed with associated damping time constant as low as one second."
"This paper analyzes in detail two of the critical aircraft maneuvers associated with approach and landing: the go-around maneuver and the flare maneuver. Optimal solutions that include state and control variable constraints are obtained for both problems. Two algorithms are given for computation of the minimum and maximum altitude loss associated with the pilot-controlled go-around maneuver. A matrix operator is obtained that can be used for in-flight computation of the altitude loss on a small general-purpose digital computer. The flare optimization presented is for a cost functional that includes both the longitudinal touchdown dispersion and the normal acceleration. A closed-loop mechanization is given that approximates the optimal trajectory. A second matrix operator which can be used for prediction of the longitudinal touchdown point is obtained. Uncertainties are also obtained for the purpose of establishing a prediction confidence level. It is proposed that these prediction techniques should be incorporated into a decision making performance monitor. This monitor could provide the pilot with a continuous assessment of the approach and could generate a preflare decision on whether or not to commit the aircraft to the flare maneuver."
"This paper presents a simple method for determining the losses resulting from detecting only the in-phase component of the complex signal vector returned from a Rayleigh-distributed target. A simple rule is given in terms of the fluctuation loss and integration gain of square-law-detected pulses. The integration improvement for the in-phase channel is given for both slow and fast fluctuating Rayleigh targets. The loss associated with failure to use the quadrature signal component is basic in that it accounts for only one Gaussian sample and, therefore, one degree of freedom. The loss incurred with one square-law-detected return as normally implemented in radar receivers represents two degrees of freedom. It is well known that the system performance improves, approaching that for the constant target, with increasing degrees of freedom of the received data. This paper is an extension of earlier work in that it relates previously computed data to a simple rule."
"The confused and conflicting state of environmental criteria for transmission lines is discussed. The demands thrust upon electric utilities by pressure groups and legislation provide unsatisfactory guidance for environmental considerations. Environmental considerations are necessary for transmision lines, but realistic, flexible rules must be developed to balance protection of the ecology and the need for electrical energy."
"This paper presents a computational method for the calculation of probability of detection using measured radar target cross-section data. The described method can also be used for probability of detection calculations when the radar target cross section follows a specified probability density function. Using the computational procedure of the paper, a number of curves are generated which can be used for probability of detection calculations with exponential and Gaussian radar target cross-section distributions. The results obtained using theoretical distributions are compared with the corresponding results using actual target cross-section measurements. The results of computer runs are compared to the corresponding values in the literature where available."
"Terrestrial inertial navigation is typically performed using an instrumented platform stabilized in a \"local-level\" configuration for convenient generation of geographic navigation information. The local-level geographic reference must be maintained by torquing the system gyros, a requirement which may be incompatible with high-precision inertial sensors currently under development. Gyro torquing in a gimballed navigation system can be avoided by employing a \"space-stable\" mechanization of the platform where an inertial, rather than geographic, reference is used for navigation calculations. The software design problems associated with this concept, especially those related to the application of Kalman filtering, are the principle focus of this paper. Although the space-stable configuration has been used extensively for spacecraft navigation and guidance, it has not been widely applied to terrestrial navigation, either for air or marine applications. The chief problem in this application is to perform navigation in local-level coordinates, using system outputs generated in an inertial reference frame. It can be demonstrated that, although the navigation system error dynamics are identical for the local-level and space-stable configurations, the dynamics of the sensor errors which drive these systems are quite different. These differences in sensor error propagation characteristics impose new requirements for the design of procedures to accomplish system calibration, alignment, and reset. This paper outlines a Kalman filtering approach which is applicable to all of the above procedures, and presents numerical results to demonstrate its effectiveness."

"A method is presented for adaptively adjusting the parameters of a double MTI canceller to minimize the effects of frequency-shifted clutter spectra. The technique is implicitly gain normalized, such that changing power levels do not affect system performance. The use of \"look ahead\" methods and \"fading memory\" filtering allows for real-time tracking of the center frequency of the clutter spectra."
 "The properties of an adaptive array antenna, including transient response rate and control loop noise, depend on the intensity of the external noise field. The dependence can be reduced by a general envelope normalization. This can be done without degrading the performance of the adaptive array. Special cases of the normalization are envelope limiting, considered in [4], and one-bit digitization of the real and imaginary parts of the signal from which the envelopes are formed, considered in [5]. Another important special case is one-bit digitization of the imaginary part of the signal from which the envelopes are formed while the real part is set to zero."
  "A log-normal variate is described by its median value and by the standard deviation of In(σc/σm), where σc is the variate and σm is its median value. For radar applications, the mean value of the variate is useful, and this correspondence derives the effect upon the mean value of various degrees of limiting. Numerical results are presented in the form of a family of curves where the limit level is the abscissa and the resulting mean value is the ordinate."

 "Two basic concepts of rate aided tracking and position aided tracking are applied to a conventional pointing system in order to improve performance. The aided track signals are derived in an inertial space format and are generated from a Kalman filter algorithm. Computational results are included to show the interplay between the conventional pointing system and the aided track filter."
"The behavior of a tracking system during its acquisition phase is studied in the case where the input signal is a frequency step. The tracking system considered is a generalization of a type-II phase-lock loop where the phase detector characteristic is a general function. In order to improve the acquisition characteristics, the natural evolution of the local oscillator is modified by a command signal chosen in order to minimize the acquisition time, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to maximize the lock-in range and the capture range of the tracking system. The influence of the different parameters (input, damping, natural frequency, pha e characteristic,command signal) on the acquisition of the resulting systems has been précised by means of a theoretical study of the trajectories in the phase plane and by an analog simulation. A simple criterion adopted in order to characterize the acquisition of a system disturbed by noise permits the study of the influence of S/N ratio on acquisition time."
"Averaging techniques are developed to represent buck, boost, and buck-boost types of switched dc-dc converters by approximate continuous models. Simple analytical expressions in terms of the circuit components are derived for the characteristic transient and frequency responses of time-average(continuous) power-stage models for use in designing and understanding the behavior of corresponding switched power stages. Novel conclusions include the dependence of effective circuit component values upon switch duty ratio and the existence of a real positive zero in certain transfer functions. Responses from analog computer simulations of the switched and averaged powerstages agree well and, in turn, confirm the analytic predictions. High-order systems can be analyzed by the averaging technique without a commensurate increase in complexity."
"An analysis is presented for the transfer functions of a particular pulsewidth modulator and power-stage subsystem that has been widely used in practical switching-mode dc regulator systems. The switch and filter are in a \"buck\" configuration, and the switch is driven by a constant-frequency, variable duty-ratio, push-pull magnetic modulator employing square-loop cores. The two transfer functions considered are that with modulator control signal as input and that with line voltage as input. For ac signal,the corresponding describing functions (DF) are derived. It is shown thatcurrent-source drive to the modulator extends the control DF frequency response over that with voltage drive, and that complete cancellation of the effects of line variations can be obtained at dc, but not for ac. Experimental confirmation of the analytical results for the control DF are presented."
"A technique for designing normalizing processors for locally non-stationary clutter is discussed. The design procedure assumes the logarithm of the clutter power varies as a polynomial with range. When the actual environment matches the design environment, the false-alarm rate is a constant that is independent of the polynomial coefficients. A measure of the relative target detection capability as a function of the number of normalization cells and the degree of the design-environment polynomial is given. The applicability of the processors to non-Rayleigh clutter is discussed."
"A method for aligning the rotary tilt table for an inertial-platform maintenance facility without surveying the site is analyzed and evaluated. The method utilizes multiple measurements of the tilt-table azimuth alignment error with different inertial platforms to determine a best estimate of the alignment error. Error analysis indicates that useful facility performance can be obtained with only a small number of measurements. The tilt-tablealignment accuracy can be improved as more measurements of the alignment error are made during normal facility operation."
"Signal interference in the half-wave linear detector has been studied only for amplitude modulation. In this paper, we treat signal interference for both an amplitude-and an angle-modulation communication system. The input to the half-wave linear detector is assumed to be composed of an amplitude-modulated wave, an angle-modulated wave, and narrow-band Gaussian noise. In particular, when strongweak relations exist in the input processes, a detailed analysis for the output component is presented to clarify some useful output properties."
"A study is made of transmission by radomes, with particular reference to cross polarization, and of the consequent radiation patterns of the radome with its aerial for both linear and circular polarizations. The work is embodied in a computer program which considers a scanner of specifiable size, position, and power distribution at different orientations inside a multilayer radome of given dimensions, class of shape, and construction in terms of the number and properties of its layers. Initially, rays are traced from points on the scanner, and details of their paths and propagation are presented in tables of preliminary results; later, diffraction theory is used. Polar diagrams of cross polarization, of main beam, etc., are presented in final tables for the system. Nearly all the parameters are specifiable, and so the program has reasonably general applicability, and it can also assess the effects of bandwidth, tapering of layer thickness, complex permittivity, and other parameters of the system."
"In satellite-to-helicopter communications, interference exists on the incoming signal when the receiving antenna is located below the rotor blades. A bound is established for the performance of a coherent fixed-tone ranging system operating at L band in this interference environment. The scalar diffracted field beneath the rotating blades, at L band and above, is found to satisfy the criterion of Fresnel diffraction, and is computed using the techniques of Fourier optics. The diffracted field is expressed in terms of a narrow-band signal. The amplitude and phase components are calculated from a Fourier Series expansion using the FFT algorithm. The significant harmonics of the phase component of the interference combine with the baseband of the narrow-band, phase-modulated ranging signal. This results in CW interference, and in rearrangement of the first-order, sideband, ranging-tone channel powers. The degradation in ranging accuracy is evaluated by computing the signal-to-interference (SIR) ratio for a set of ranging tones. The post-detection (SIR)PD at the output of the correlator is shown to be a function of the amplitude of the phase harmonics of the interference, the relative difference between the ranging tone and interference center frequencies (a function of rotor speed), the rangetone modulation indices, and the post-detection filter noise bandwidth."
"A decision-directed (DD) technique for the detection of overlapping PCM/NRZ signals in the presence of white Gaussian noise is investigated. The performance of the DD detector is represented by probability of error PE versus input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To examine how much improvement in performance can beachieved with this technique, PE's with and without DD feedback are evaluated in parallel. Further, analytical results are compared with those found by Monte Carlo simulations. The results are shown in good agreement."
"The acquisition detectability parameter, output signal-to-noise ratio, has been computed for unrestricted random access through an ideal hard limiter. The method involves multidimensional Fourier series and numerical integration. The results depend on the number of active users, total number of users, input signal-to-noise ratio, address code length, cross-correlation properties of code, and other parameters. The method provides a tool for synthesis of randomaccess networks, i.e., satellite repeaters for land, sea, or air-borne transmitters, or mobile radio relays concerned with accidental or intentional interference."
 "In a previous paper, the author obtained conditions for the acceleration of a missile pursuing a maneuvering target according to proportional navigation, to be bounded. This correspondence extends previous work, and new boundaries are obtained for the missile acceleration."
"A digital frequency-lock generator has been developed which produces an output pulse train automatically locked to the pulse repetition rate, or frequency, of an input pulse train. This device, which exhibits a wide capture range and has no static output frequency drift, offers several advantages over a phase-lock loop in frequency-locking applications."
"In this correspondence, maximum-likelihood M-ary detection theory is applied to an incoherent optical system model employing photo detectors governed by Laguerre counting statistics. It is shown that a maximum-likelihood Laguerre detector corresponds to a count comparison over each signaling interval. Error probability is derived."

 "The application of digital onboard computers for flight control of high-performance aerospace vehicles is desirable, with respect to hardware effort and reliability, as well as operational flexibility. Up to now, digital computers have not been used for the control of short periodic angular oscillations. This task can be solved with the capability of digital computers now available. A good vehicle for the realization of appropriate control equations is the \"frequency transformation\". Using the simplified dynamics of a supersonic aircraft as an example, a procedure for synthesis of a digital control filter is presented. After a first evaluation in the s domain, the design is checked for validity in the frequency domain. If necessary, the original design is corrected appropriately."
"The Doppler sidelobes of a received pulse burst may be partially controlled by varying the amplitudes of the pulses in the burst or sequence upon transmission and/or reception. When there is a peak power limitation, weighting the amplitudes produces a loss in signal-to-noise ratio. A general expression is derived for the loss factor under the peak power limitation, and loss factor formulas are given for the following cases: Case A: Full nominal weights upon reception. Uniform weights on transmission. Case B: Square roots of the nominal weights on both transmission and reception. Case C: Full nominal weights on both transmission and reception. These cases are listed in order of increasing loss. Numerical results are tabulated for regular spacings and for the following nominal weights: 1) Dolph-Tchebycheff, 2) Taylor, 3) Hamming, and 4) Hann."
"Although there is a well-defined relation between range and range rate, in conventional pulse-Doppler tracking radars the range-gate and frequency control loops are usually closed independently. In this paper, the optimum cross- coupled stationary tracking filter is derived, in which the range error signal is used to boost the frequency loop, and vice versa. The filter is derived for a general case of target dynamics and uncorrelated white noise in both the range gate and frequency control channels. It is shown that its tracking performance is superior to that of the conventional uncoupled tracking loop for reliable frequency channel operation. In solving the usually difficult degenerated Riccati matrix equation, a simple solution is obtained by applying the method of completion of the square to matrixes."
"A pulse-position modulation (PPM) system based on energy detection is described. The system is shown to be applicable to a communication system in which the arrival times of signals are unknown. The decision statistics are chisquare distributed (either central or noncentral), and recursive methods of computing probabilities of error are derived. A simple digital processor for implementing the system is also described."
"This paper examines the feasibility of providing maritime mobile telecommunications as a new service via satellites. A global system with a capacity of 10 duplex voice/data channels (plus an interrogation/reply channel) per satellite is described. The capability is achieved with a 0-dB gain UHF antenna in the ship and a UHF phased array in the satellite, which produces 11 steerable beams, each with 30-dB peak gain. The links between satellite and shore are assumed to be at SHF. A dedicated satellite weighs 320 kg, which can be launched with an up-rated Thor-Delta. The prime power requirement of 730 watts is provided by an oriented solar array."
"Maneuvering target motion is modeled by introducing a binary random variable in the target state equation. The optimal estimate is shown to be a weighted combination of two Kalman filter estimates with weights depending on the likelihood ratio for the detection of a maneuver. A tracking scheme is proposed for maneuvering target tracking and illustrated in an example."
"The trajectory of a maneuvering aircraft can be described by piecewise-constant-coefficient second-order polynomials which constitute a non-Gaussian process at the input of a linear fire control predictor. Consequently, the \"on- target\" probability which is determined by the predictor output cannot be analytically evaluated. Using this a priori assumption for this type of target trajectory, the structure of a finite-time polynomial filter is determined. By using the \"go-no-go\" characteristic of the loss function, the smoothing time of the predictor can be optimized to yield the highest possible \"on-target\" probability. The results obtained constitute lower bounds whose validity is verified by digital simulation of the system. This shows that, on the average, they are 15 percent below the exact values. The simulation program is also used in a comparative study, with a conventional predictor and a Wiener-type predictor. The results demonstrate that the finite time polynomial predictor is markedly superior to both systems for a wide range of parameters and their combinations."
"This paper presents second-order algorithms for fixed- point and fixed-lag smoothing problems for nonlinear systems. The algorithms are obtained on the basis of the state augmentation approach, used earlier by the authors, for dealing with linear smoothing problems. Both discrete-and continuous-time forms of solutions are presented and the results are illustrated by considering a radar tracking problem. Some of the advantages of the proposed smoothing solutions compared to existing ones are also discussed."
"The probability of error is computed in a quadriphase communication system, with a causal bandlimiting bandpass filter. Intersymbol interference in each channel and intersymbol interference from the neighboring channel is evaluated. The effect of nonoptimal sampling time on the probability of error is presented."
"The probability of error P(e) is computed in a binary communication system with a single-pole IF filter. The effect of time-bandwidth product foT and IF frequency to band width ratio f1/Ifo on P(e) is shown. The sampling time is optimized and the effect of nonoptimal sampling time on P(e) is calculated."
"Plots of performance degradation are used to compare the effects of fading and intersymbol interference in a two- component specular multipath digital communications channel. Similar plots are then used to compare two practical receivers designed to combat the interference. Degradation plots are shown to allow easy identification of each receiver's range of usefulness, as well as identification of variance bounds demanded of channel parameter estimates which the receivers require."
"Exact and approximate baseband models of the DeLange frequency-modulated oscillator are derived. Exact and approximate baseband distortion equalizers, that may be used to predistort the modulation voltage so that the distortion in the output phase of the oscillator is removed, are also given."
"The detection of an optical image in the presence of uniform background light is based on a likelihood ratio formed of the numbers of photoelectrons emitted from small elements of a photoelectric surface onto which the image is focused. When diffraction is negligible and the surface has unit quantum efficiency, this detector is equipollent with the optimum detector of the image-forming light. Its performance is compared with that of the threshold detector and that of a detector basing its decisions on the total number of photoelectrons from a finite area of the image. The illuminance of the image is postulated to have a Gaussian spatial distribution. All three detectors exhibit nearly the same reliability."
"A familiar two-transistor saturable-core parallel inverter is modeled as a nonlinear negative resistance in parallel with energy-storage elements. The techniques of singular-point analysis are combined with piecewise linear techniques to permit determination of solution trajectories on the phase plane. Clear insight is provided, not only into steady-state oscillation, but also into transient behavior of the circuit. Experimental results confirming the analytical model are included."
"A series of nine programs are developed for the design of the inductors of single-winding flyback converters. Three converter types are considered: voltage step-up, current step-up, and voltage step-up/current step-up. For each of the converter types, three pulse modulators are considered: constant frequency, constant transistor on-time, and constant transistor off-time. Computer-graphics displays are used to assist in evaluating characteristics of the various converter-modulator combinations."
"The effect of modulation nonlinearity on the range response of FM radars with harmonic processing and \"triangle\" modulation is derived. The nonlinearity may be desirable or undesirable; that is, the sidelobe level of the range response may be decreased or increased depending on the shape and amount of nonlinearity. The results of this paper may be used to predict the actual range laws of existing\" linear\" FM radars; or, alternately, to specify the desired amount of modulation nonlinearity for new FM radars so that superior sidelobe suppression can be realized."
 "A new type of synthetic radar, the circular synthetic radar, uses a simple interferometer whose elements are mounted at the ends of a horizontal boom rotating about a vertical mast. Pulses are radiated alternately \"in-phase\" and in \"phase-quadrature.\" The returning echoes are also detected incoherently, both \"in-phase\" and in \"phase-quadrature.\" The four distinct outputs are fed into an on-line computer which, after a Fourier analysis, synthesizes a mapping function of the azimuthal distribution of targets."
"Quantitative bounds for the normalized second moment of a random signal process are expressed in terms of the statistics of measured quantities. No weighting is used, and, essentially, the only assumption made on the signal process is that its spectrum be bandlimited."
"A recursive method of computing values of the generalized Q function is described. The Q function is also interpreted in terms of noncentral chi-square distributed random variables, and in terms of the difference between Poisson random variables."
"Long-range surveillance radars use MTI techniques to detect moving targets in a clutter background. The transmitter PRF is usually staggered to eliminate the blind speeds due to aliasing of the target and clutter spectra. A spectral analysis of the target and clutter signals is performed for the case of nonuniform sampling, and it is shown that the clutter spectral density continues to fold over at the basic PRF, but the signal spectrum becomes dispersed in frequency, which means that an MTI rader will never be completely blind to moving targets."

 "A joint agency controlled oil slick experiment, sponsored by the United States Coast Guard, was conducted in the Pacific Ocean in the Fall of 1970. The Naval Research Laboratory's synthetic aperature radar was used to detect and monitor the slicks at frequencies of 428, 1228, 4455, and 8910 MHz during the low sea state conditions encountered. At frequencies of 1228 MHz and higher, the slicks were depicted with sharp boundaries. At 428 MHz, the boundaries were indistinct. Approximately 400 liters of oil was detected as it was being discharged from the generating ship and larger spills were mapped from the initial thickness to equilibrium thicknesses of 1 micron or less. Thin streamers of oil and wind blown films were also imaged. Area growth rates were obtained for 2500 liter spills of API 26.1 crude oil and API 9.7 fuel oil on a calm sea. The respective rates, from approximately 1 to 4 hours after the spills, were 134 m2/s and 16 m2/s."
"Define the cumulative probability Pn of occurence of some event as the probability that it occurs at least once in n trials. If the single trial probabilities are not fixed, but are drawn from a distribution of their own, or are dependent on some other nonfixed variable, then it would be convenient to have an \"effective single trial probability (esp)\" for use in the simple Bernoulli model which would give the same cumulative probability of occurence as actually observed. We show here that the esp can be interpreted as a kind of average, and that its value is given by 1 minus the geometric mean of 1-d(p), where d(p) is the probability density function of the single trial probabilities, the p's. We further define this geometric mean for both discrete and continuous distributions and evaluate the esp for several cases. These results are compared with earlier ones which suggest that the esp is given by the (arithmetic) average or expectation of the single trial probabilities, and we determine under what conditions this simpler result can be used."
"This paper indicates a basic constraint on angular resolution of targets using monopulse measurements. The specific case at hand is the angular resolution of several broadcasting targets by a passive, standard, four-horn amplitude monopulse system. It is shown that when all broadcasting targets emit spectrally equivalent wide-sense stationary signals and the antenna and target geometry are fixed, the signals presented to the radar signal processor are equivalent to those of a canonical complex of threee broadcasting targets, one at an arbitrary angle θT, one at a null of the sum channel pattern, and one at a null of the difference channel pattern. In the case of broadband flat spectral transmission, two of the three targets in the canonical complex cannot be distinguished from receiver noise. A simple method for determining the angle (or angles) at which a monopulse antenna will attempt to track a broadcasting target complex is presented. Generalizations of this theory to active and/or more complicated monopulse systems are possible."
"A two-pole filter is proposed as a detector for a scanning radar. The optimum values of the filter coefficients are found and are approximated by a simple expression. The optimum two-pole filter requires a 0.15-dB increase in signal-to-noise ratio in order to provide the same detection capability as the optimum detector, and yields azimuth estimates whose standard deviation are within 15 percent of the Cramér-Rao lower bound. The estimator is simple to implement, avoiding the storage requirements of the moving window detector and the bias complications of the feedback integrator."
"The two-target technique proposed by the author in an earlier paper [1] for reducing radar multipath angle tracking errors has been simulated on a digital computer assuming an actual closed-loop system. When tracking with noise, the technique provides angle error performance which compares quite favorably with the expected performance given in [1] Furthermore, the large bias errors usually encountered in normal monopulse systems at low elevation angles are removed. Results of typical tracks are given, both for the method of [1], and for a modified version of the method which applies primarily to shipboard radar systems. Some results on loss of lock are also presented."
"A UHF \"true logarithmic IF\" which yields a carrier output proportional in amplitude to the logarithm of the carrier input has been constructed. Although this \"true\" form has been known for a number of years, it appears to have been neglected in development. Good performance has been obtained over a 60-dB input signal range with rise and fall times of 2 ns per 20 dB. A high-level, detected dc coupled output without the use of any dc amplifier is obtained. Coherent signal processing of the output carrier is possible, and other important advantages to this type of logarithmic IF are described."
"This paper is a report on new methods for on-line testing of single-input/single-output linear and time-invariant systems. No interruption of system operation is necessary, since the signals used in this test procedure are the normal operating signals. Test results indicate that detectable system errors using finite amounts of data are well within tolerance for normal operation in all but the most stringent applications."
"A technique for generating high-linearity chirp (linear FM) signals is presented. It uses a delay line and mixer to sense the slope of the output of a swept oscillator, and the difference from desired slope is fed back to correct the oscillator frequency. The technique also improves the coherence of the oscillator. An analysis is performed of the amount of linearization that can be achieved for three possible loop configurations. Experimental results are presented of tests run on a backward wave oscillator (BWO) operating over a bandwidth of 240 MHz with time duration of 120 μs. The results indicate a linearity corresponding to a phase error (from parabolic) of 30 degrees (peak) and coherence within 5 degrees."
"The problem of designing finite-pulse-train radar signals and receivers to maximize the detectability of targets masked by thermal noise and clutter returns is considered in this paper. A practical constraint is introduced: the amplitude of each subpulse in the transmit waveform is taken to be fixed. The need for such a constraint is dictated in most radar applications, because the transmitter is most efficiently utilized by saturating its amplifying tube. An algorithm for generating optimal waveforms subject to this new constraint is presented, and the performance of the resulting waveforms is compared with those obtained using existing optimization techniques."
"Active nutation damping generally requires a unique element to provide the necessary damping torques, plus a nutation-sensing system to properly monitor and control the active element by closed-loop action. This paper describes and analyzes, by computer- assisted mathematical techniques, a nutation damper for a dual-spin spacecraft which does not require an active \"element\". Damping is achieved through the inherent cross-axis torques generated by the spacecraft products of inertia and the existing motor controlling the relative spin rates of the two dynamic components comprising the spacecraft."
"The design of a narrowband, phase-modulated, multisubcarrier, phase-coherent, space-communication system requires that the subcarrier modulation indices be kept within close tolerance limits. This need arises since the modulation indices directly affect the division of power among the carrier and subcarriers. If the system is not designed in an optimum manner to handle large tolerance variation, the system performance may degrade sharply in an adverse environment. A universal graphical technique-modulation loss contours-is developed as a design tool for the \"optimum\" selection of modulation indices. The technique is novel in that it yields solutions directly from the universal curves and does not require the drawing of additional curves. Two criteria of optimization are considered, simultaneous thresholding and minimal sensitivity. The minimally sensitive case is considered as weighted simultaneous thresholding and is solved by the aid of a graphical algorithm. The technique is applicable to k subcarriers (sinusoidal and/or square wave), considering three subcarriers at a time-two subcarriers as direct variables and the third as a parameter-all other subcarriers remaining constant. Previous techniques required trial and error methods, drawing of curves, or computerized search techniques to arrive at the proper modulation indices and maximum tolerance bands. This method allows a quick solution to the tolerance problem and optimum selection of modulation indices, facilitating the design and/or analysis of narrowband PM systems."
"Optimization of the filter, the signal, and the signal and filter jointly are studied in the sonar environment under noise and reverberation limited conditions. The maximization of the receiver output signal-to-interference ratio is used as a performance criterion with unit energy constraint on both signal and filter. In the filter design problem, the optimum filter function is the solution of a linear integral equation. The kernel of the integral equation is a function of the target and medium scattering functions and the reverberation distribution. In the signal design problem, a similar type of integral equation is obtained as in the filter optimization problem. In the joint signal and filter design problem, it is shown that the optimum signal and filter functions are the solutions to a pair of linear integral equations with the largest (SIR)O. Several examples are investigated for different mediums and reverberation distributions with the finite matrix approximation method. An interative technique is used to compute the joint optimization of signal and filter."
"The performance of a coherent MTI is determined by two sets of parameters: the interpulse periods and the weighting coefficients. The latter are expressed in terms of the former so as to maximize clutter attenuation. Interpulse periods are optimized so as to remove blind velocities. The many local optima of the interpulse periods have improvement factors that show differences of up to 6 dB for a 5-pulse canceler. A computer program has been developed that combines random search and the gradient method to produce points that combine a high value of the improvement factor with good blind speeds performance."
"A detailed inaccuracy and sensitivity analysis of a long-distance air pollution detection system, using a laser measuring the resonance absorption of polluting molecules, is introduced. The noise and the dynamic range of the radiation detectors used, the atmospheric inhomogeneities, and the atmospheric propagation losses of the electromagnetic radiation are considered. In addition, the best measuring path length as a function of a molecule density and atmospheric transparency and irregularity is discussed."
"The optimum design of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems intended to classify randomly reflecting areas, such as agricultural fields, characterized by a reflectivity density spectral density is studied. Assuming areas of known shape and location, the binary case, and a certain Gaussian signal field property, and ignoring interfield interference, the problem solution is given. The optimum processor includes conventional matched filter processing, but is nonlinear; a coherent optical system realization is outlined. The performance is approximated using a x2 assumption and bounded by the Cernov bound. A fundamental design problem involves the system bandwidth analogously, in a special case, as in diversity communication systems; a solution is given based on the Cernov bound. A set of summary design curves is given and exemplified by a satellite SAR system design. Also discussed is the measurement of reflectivity spectral density amplitude with imaging sidelooking (synthetic or \"brute-force\") radars and the maximum likelihood estimator's accuracy and realization with a coherent optical system. It is also shown that a CW modulation is useable if the random reflectivity is, effectively, isotropic. Finally, the reflectivity density spectral density amplitude, when constant over the spatial bandpass of the measuring system, is related to the scattering cross-section density commonly measured."
"Gravity uncertainties are an inexorable source of error in all inertial navigation systems and are particularly important in high-quality inertial navigation systems. In this paper the steady-state rms errors that are excited in a damped inertial navigation system are analytically determined for four gravity uncertainty models and two vehicle maneuver models. The statistical approach used in this paper is compared with an alternate scheme (\"direct simulation\") that does not require statistical models for gravity uncertainties."
"The case of linear, uniformly weighted phased arrays is examined via time and frequency domain analyses. Bounds that must be placed on array length, modulation frequency, modulation index ß, and scan angle relationships if excessive distortion is to be avoided in wideband angle-modulated communication systems are established. Distortion is shown to consist of odd harmonic terms. It is also shown that, for one class of equivalent RF signals, phased arrays produce approximately three times as much distortion in frequency-modulation (FM) systems as in phase-modulation (PM) systems. Graphs of distortion plotted as functions of signal and array parameters show that, for practical array sizes, distortion is a monotonically increasing function of the product of L and sin 0 where L is the length of the array expressed in modulation wavelengths ^m and 0 is the scan angle. In PM systems, distortion also increases monotonically with the modulation index ß. Plots of distortion versus L sin 0 show that even relatively small arrays can produce intolerable distortion levels in wideband systems; e.g., an FM system having ß = 3,L = 0.35^m, and 0= 60 degrees exhibits approximately 20 percent distortion."
"A maneuvering synthetic aperture radar in squint mode, during a loosely piloted maneuver, is simulated with presence of various navigation system errors. The error sources investigated place emphasis on short-term effects, involving platform servo transients, noise and quantization in accelerometers, interaction of angle pickoff uncertainty with the displacement from platform to radar antenna, and uncertainty in this displacement itself. Simulation results are accompained by interpretive discussion, and followed by suggested areas for further study."
 "A common problem in radar system design is the choice of multiple PRF's to eliminate the blind speeds associated with coherent pulse bursts with uniform pulse spacing. This correspondence describes the procedure of selecting a set of PRF's in such a manner that the unambiguous Doppler achievable with the entire set is maximized. Based on this optimization of the set of PRF's, we determine how many PRF's the set should contain in order to minimize the required beam dwell time for a specified unambiguous Doppler."
"Closed-form formulas allow rapid determination of noncoherent integration gain and integration loss when the single-sample IF signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is known. In addition, if the required SNR is known for any number of integrated pulses, the required SNR for any other number is easily determined. A closed-form expression is given for radar collapsing loss, expressed in terms of the equivalent integrated signal-to-noise ratio required to produce a given combination of false-alarm and detection probabilities. Alternatively, the single-sample signal-to-noise ratio of a set of samples may be used together with the closed-form expression for integration gain to get the equivalent integrated signal-to-noise ratio."
"A technique is presented using state notation for deriving the steady-state noise reduction factors for an exponential filter. The technique is carried through to derive those factors for the third-order exponential filter."
"Dolph-Chebyshev amplitude weighting is used with FFT signal processors and array antennas when a low sidelobe response is required. This particular weighting minimizes the width of the mainlobe response while forcing all of the sidelobes to a specified sidelobe level. As the specified sidelobe level is reduced, the mainlobe width increases, as does the loss in signal-to-noise ratio. This correspondence describes how the Dolph-Chebyshev weights may be easily calculated, and gives design data showing how signal-to-noise loss and mainlobe width vary with the specified sidelobe level."

 "A strapdown system is considered as an unaided inertial navigator aboard an aircraft. Presented here are simulation results detailing the propagation of navigation errors (in nautical miles) due to strapdown sensor errors for four trajectories. They indicate the type of performance that can be expected from a strapdown system utilizing good \"off the shelf\" gyros and accelerometers, and dramatically illustrate the improvements necessary in these components to obtain navigation performance comparable to that available from a good gimballed inertial system. The total navigation error for each trajectory is broken down to show the contribution from each of the various error sources. This breakdown quickly reveals which are the critical error sources for a given trajectory class, and also points up the relationship that exists between each individual error source, aircraft maneuvers, and the resulting navigation error. Several of the error mechanisms are discussed at length and a set of linearized differential equations which can be used to analyze error propagations is presented. These results should be of particular interest to the system designer who is faced with the problem of specifying the sensor error parameters necessary to meet mission performance requirements. With an analysis similar to the one presented here, but structured around his own expected mission trajectories, the designer should be able to confidently predict system accuracies and intelligently perform tradeoffs on the critical system parameters."
"Maximum-likelihood estimates for the levels of the mean value function and the covariance function of a Gaussian random process are investigated. The stability of these estimates is examined as the actual covariance function of the process deviates from the form assumed in the estimators. It is found that the time-bandwidth product for stationary processes represents an upper bound on the number of estimator terms that can be safely used when estimating with uncertainty about the process covariance function. This result is consistent with other interpretations of the time-bandwidth product and tempers the conclusion that, in principle, an infinite number of estimator terms can be used to obtain a perfect estimate of the covariance level. In practice, the estimate of the level can never be perfect, and the accuracy of the estimate depends on the observation interval. Finally, conditions are established to ensure asymptotic stability of the estimates and physical interpretations are presented."
"The design of a suboptimal terminal guidance system for reentry vehicles with a constraint on the body attitude angle at impact is studied. Permissible range of the miss distance and the body attitude angle at impact is specified. The problem is formulated as a linear quadratic control problem. The Riccati equation is derived to provide time-varying feedback gains. The desired scheme is suboptimal. The region of initial states for which the system meets the specifications becomes smaller as the initial height of the reentry vehicle at initial time is decreased."
"The effect of spectral bandwidth and spectral shape upon laser binary communication systems is investigated. The probability of error is plotted as a function of bandwidth for Lorentzian and Gaussian shaped spectra. The results show that even when the average noise power and the signal-to-noise ratio are held constant, the probability of error varies considerably as a function of spectral bandwidth."
"This work investigates the performance of an all-digital, total-power radiometer (TPR), consisting of RF, mixer, and IF stages followed by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Square-law detection and smoothing is performed in a digital computer. A figure of merit, the degradation factor, is defined which compares the digital TPR with an ideal analog TPR. Exact results are obtained which include the effects of saturation, finite step size, and finite sampling rate of the ADC. A good approximation is developed which compares favorably with the exact results under certain conditions. The use of a general digital filter for smoothing is considered. A new parameter, the \"equivalent summation number\", is shown to be analogous to the equivalent integration time of an analog TPR."
"The edge diffraction method of analysis utilized in the past to determine amplitude patterns is extended in this paper to predict the radiation phase center of pyramidal horn antennas. A series of extensive phase and amplitude measurements were performed on these antennas to determine the validity of the theoretical results. The measurements were performed over a frequency range of 7.5 to 10.5 GHz in the E plane of the antennas. The phase measurements were accurate to ±0.2 electrical degrees, so that the phase center locations relative to the horn apertures were repeatably determined to better than 0.010 inch for horn apertures as large as 7 inches. The results of the measurements indicate that excellent agreement is obtained with the theory in predicting the phase center location of the larger horns (kRE > 50). For the smaller horns, however, there is a large discrepancy between the theory and measurements. The measured phase centers of the smaller horns exhibit a large variation with frequency which cannot be explained with the existing theory. Several reasons for the discrepancy are presented, and it is concluded that a more rigorous approach involving higher order modes has to be developed for the smaller horns."
"The estimation of a multimodal linear system whose mode-to-mode transitions are described by a finite-state Markov chain is described. The problem has application in studying separation standards in an air traffic control environment. An optimal solution is formulated which is computationally infeasible. A suboptimal estimator is then derived which closely approximates the optimal estimator. An example is presented to illustrate the technique."
"The application of existing estimation theory to the problem of specification and performance of passive sonar spectral estimators is considered. The classification function is addressed, so that the signal is assumed to be present, and so that the energy arrival angle is known. The spatial filter considered is a line array of M equally spaced omnidirectional hydrophones. Signal and ambient noise are both zero-mean, wide-sense, stationary Gaussian random processes that differ in their spatial correlation across the face of the array. The signal is a plane wave that can be made totally spacially corrected between array elements by inserting delays between sensors to invert the signal propagation delay. The noise correlation is a function of frequency, bandwidth, element separation, and the relative time delay between sensors. Under these assumptions, the Cramer-Rao lower bound is derived for the class of unbiased estimates of signal power in a narrow frequency band at the hydrophone in the presence of correlated ambient noise of known power. The bound is examined numerically, resulting in a threshold phenomenon with M that constitutes a new design consideration. In addition, there is a striking insensitivity to realistic values of ambient noise correlation, and there are ranges in signal-to-noise ratio for which one gains more by increasing M than by increasing the bandwidth-time product. Specific processors, including a new unbiased estimator when noise power is unknown, are developed."
"The word error rate of an ensemble of cryptographic systems is determined. The word error rate is specified as a function of the corresponding plain-text bit error rate. Degradation is defined and computed for the case of phase-shift keying and white Gaussian noise. Finally, the effect of differential encoding on a cryptographic system is investigated."
"The Kalman filtering technique is used to obtain analytical expressions for the optimum position and velocity accuracy that can be achieved in a navigation system that measures position at uniform sampling intervals of T seconds through random noise with an rms value of σx. A one-dimensional dynamic model, with piecewise-constant acceleration assumed, is used in the analysis, in which analytic expressions for position and velocity accuracy (mean square), before and after observations, are obtained. The errors are maximum immediately before position measurements are made. The maximum position error, however, can be bounded by the inherent sensor error by use of a sufficiently high sampling rate, which depends on the sensor accuracy and acceleration level. The steady-state Kalman filter for realizing the optimum estimates consists of a double integrator, the initial conditions of which are reset at each observation."
"This paper presents a simple approach to the derivation of sensitivity measures of smoothing algorithms. It is proposed that the known sensitivity results of the Kalman filtering algorithm be utilized along with the state augmentation approach for this purpose. The sensitivity measures so obtained are easier to compute than the ones available in the literature. It is then shown that the fixed-point smoothing algorithm, derived recently by Biswas and Mahalanabis [1], [2], is less sensitive to model parameter variations than the algorithm studied by Griffin and Sage [7], [8]. The case of a satellite tracking problem is presented by way of illustrating the results."
"For direct measurement of the integrated radiation dose experienced in Earth synchronous orbit, p-i-n diodes were flown as radiation dosimeters on LES-6. The diode, which has a lifetime of 10-4 seconds in the intrinsic region, was originally developed as a neutron dosimeter, but can detect 1-MeV electron fluences as low as 1013 e·cm-2. Observations over three years in orbit are presented."
"The commutating impedance of homopolar alternators of medium frequency, as described by Trutt and Erdélyi [1], has to be kept at a low value in order to enable the various arrangements made up from solid-state elements to convert frequencies of 3500 Hz to the usual 400 or 60 Hz used in aerospace supplies. This can be achieved by fitting damping devices into homopolar inductor alternators. To study theoretically the effect of these devices, the inductances of the various windings must be known. This problem is treated here. For this purpose, the two-dimensional model of the alternator and the vector potential analysis of the cross section (as shown by Schenk et al. [2]) is used. Because of the varying position of the stator winding with respect to the rotor teeth, these reactances are time-dependent, and the coefficients of the differential equations describing the commutating (subtransient) regime are time-varying. The calculations were carried out for a 95-kVA, 115/200 V, 5 rotor teeth, 3400-Hz homopolar inductor alternator. The air gap of the alternator was 0.030 inch. Detailed data of the homopolar inductor alternator are in [1] and [6]."
"The general differential equations for the circuits of a homopolar inductor alternator are established. The system of equations is modified for the case of nonsymmetrical subtransient operation. The Runge-Kutta and Adams-Moulton methods are used to solve the system of differential equations with variable coefficients. The solution is obtained for different initial conditions. Several damper winding designs are analyzed. A step-by-step correction method in the time domain is used to improve the approximate initial value of the subtransient reactance. This method takes care of saturation, which changes greatly during a subtransient. The analysis of the most advantageous design of the axial damper winding located in the armature slots is given in this paper. All calculations were carried out for the same alternator as used in the companion paper [1]."
"In radars that achieve a high subclutter visibility by coherent processing over several pulses, a serious problem appears in the form of blind Dopplers, or \"speeds,\" at which target detection is impossible. Of the possible methods of eliminating these blind speeds, the most basic one that is employed when the performance requirements are high involves the use of several PRF's. These PRF's are chosen so that coverage is obtained at any Doppler with at least one PRF. The problem faced by the radar designer is to select the set of PRF's and the pulse numbers for each PRF so that the search frame time is minimized. This paper evolves a systematic method for the design of the blind-speed elimination scheme. A formalized approach is offered that shows the possible combinations of wavelength, PRF, and pulse number and the tradeoffs involved, without introducing the confusion ordinarily associated with multiparameter choices."
"A procedure is presented for computing radar range performance for different types of radars. It is associated with any arbitrary cumulative probability of detection and false alarm probability for a search radar when scanning uniformly. The emphasis is on presenting a model for engineering use, rather than on its theoretical justification."
"The losses due to the statistical error inherent in estimating the mean clutter velocity by averaging over a limited number of range cells are derived. These results show that an accepted intuitive approach leads to a significant underestimation of the number of range cells required. Suggestions are made for reducing these losses."
"The loss of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is derived when the magnitude of weak signals in noise is discarded and the phase angle is quantized for digital processing. It is shown that very coarse quantization results in only a small loss."
"The technique of adaptive filtering as applied to the design of a frequency-reuse receiving antenna which can provide optimum isolation from signals of unwanted polarization."
"The time-domain transient response of a thin dipole antenna is discussed in terms of element lengths and the surge impedances of the transmission line and element terminals. Theory and measurements show that, unlike symmetric configurations, asymmetry in the element lengths, together with appropriate mismatch of the transmission line, produces radiation proportional to the first time derivative of the signal voltage, and replica reception proportional to the incoming field."
"A method of locating radio emitters anywhere on the surface of the Earth, by using bearing measurements, is presented. The method associates planes of bearing with the measured bearings, and characterizes these planes by their unit normals. The emitter is located by finding the unit vector from the Earth's center that minimizes the sum of squares of its inner product with the normal vectors. The solution is found in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a 3 × 3 matrix."

"Statistical estimation theory is applied to the problem of analyzing data obtained in dynamic tracer studies in nuclear medicine. Procedures are given for the determination of the maximum likelihood (ML), maximum a posteriori probability (MAP), and minimum meansquare-error (MMSE) estimates of parameters describing the transport of the monitored tracer in tissue. Some numerical results are given for data obtained in monitoring the natural decay of strontium-85 and oxygen-15 isotopes frequently used in nuclear medicine."
"We have been able to differentiate between 12 dyslexic children and 13 normal age- and sex-matched children on the basis of spectral estimates of their electroencephalograms (EEG's). The children were monitored during various mental tasks and rest situations. Data dimensionality was reduced by ``banding'' various spectral components and eliminating others. The reduced spectral vectors were used as an input to a stepwise discriminant analysis program which, in effect, selected the variables most disparate between the two groups (dyslexic and normal)."
"A compensatory tracking task using a visual display and augmented auditory feedback and requiring subjects to maintain a 500-gm force on a control stick has been modified for clinical use. Integrated absolute values of the subjects' force error/second (tremor scores) have been used as a measure of steadiness, and power spectra of the force error have been used to establish the predominant tremor frequencies. Twenty parkinsonian patients, 7 age-matched controls, and 20 young controls have been evaluated, and representative tremor-time records, tremor scores, and tremor-power spectra are presented. The quantitative measures have proven sensitive to individual differences among normals, yet having a dynamic range sufficient to include the most severely afflicted patient tested. Normative values of both tremor scores and predominant tremor frequencies have been established and are significantly different from the parkinsonian values, the parkinsonian patients having a higher average tremor score [8.31 versus 3.76 (gram . seconds/second)] and a lower mean predominant tremor frequency (6.6 Hz versus 7.9 Hz). Representative tremor-power spectra have proven useful in describing physiological and parkinsonian tremors. Reevaluation over 1-3-week intervals indicates that the quantitative measures of tremor scores are reliable (r= 0.83, p < 0.01 for control subjects; r = 0.87, p < 0.01 for parkinsonian patients). In addition, the predominant tremor frequency as measured from the tremor-power spectra is found to be independent of learning effects. It is emphasized that such tests are not designed as diagnostic tools in themselves."
"A miniature totally implantable FM/FM telemetry system has been developed to simultaneously measure blood pressure and blood flow, thus providing an appreciation of the hemodynamics of the circulation to the entire body or to a particular organ. Developed for work with animal subjects, the telemetry system's transmission time is controlled by an RF signal that permits an operating life of several months."
"An electronic monitoring system has been developed to detect the four conditions that usually lead to fibrillation in the infarcted heart. Artifact-free QRS detection is accomplished by passing the preamplified QRS through a bandpass filter, an automatic gain control (AGC)circuit, a full-wave rectifier, a nonlinear amplifier, and positive and negative slope detectors. High-threshold logic circuitry then applies the timing criteria necessary for positive identification of a QRS complex. A printout of the ECG is made if 1) the number of premature beats in the last minute exceeds a physician-set number (0 through 10), 2) the number of successive anomalous beats (i. e., area increase, QRS increase, or polarity reversal) exceeds a physician-set number (0 through 5), 3) an \"early\" premature beat occurs (i.e., R-R' < QT), or 4) a multiformal beat is detected (i.e., its morphology differs from that of the previous anomalous beat)."
"The specific resistance (ρ) of canine blood, having a hematocrit (H) range extending from 0 to 70 percent, was measured at 37°C and 25 kHz using a variable-length conductivity cell connected to a constant-current impedance bridge. A least-squares exponential fit for the experimentally determined dataprovided the relationship ρ = 56.8e0.025H with a correlation coefficient of 0.989. The data obtained were also fitted to the Maxwell-Fricke equation; an excellent fit was obtained in the range of 0-50 percent hematocrit using a form factor of 2.5."
"A method of semiautomatic quantification of sharpness of EEG phenomena is described. The rectified second derivative of the original EEG tracing is utilized for this purpose and has proven satisfactory in connection with the type of question asked. The method is inexpensive and easy to carry out."
 "A system for automatic calibration of blood pressure transducers is described. Automatic calibration is accomplished by activation of an analog-controlled servo system that sets the zero balance and gain in a single sequence. An unlimited number of transducers may be calibrated simultaneously, and calibration is completed within a period of less than 1 min. Accuracy and repeatability are assured without dependence on the operator's judgment."
"A circuit is described that compensates for dc shifts at the input of a high-input impedance preamplifier used for microelectrode recording. The compensation is made by a negative feedback potential in series with the input. Although the whole recording system operates on an ac basis during automatic compensation, dc recording is possible by suspending further changes in the compensation."
"A broad-band EEG frequency analyzer system is described which has been designed for the continuous analysis of experiments lasting several hours. It allows the quantitative measurement of the time course of the effects of various centrally active drugs on the EEG. Analog frequency analysis coupled with digital output provides an efficient means of data collection. Subsequent reduction of data is a accomplished by statistical techniques described elsewhere."

"The design parameters for blood electrodeacidification were determined experimentally with due consideration of the physical properties of the diffusion of hydrogen through palladium (Pd) membrane electrodes, along with the physiological aspects of hemodialysis and electrohemodialysis for acidosis. Several models of an electrodeacidifier for extracorporeally circulating blood were built. Initial designs showed difficulties with clotting of heparinized blood and excessive hemolysis, but no evidence of membrane fouling. In subsequent experiments the clotting problem was eliminated by the interposition of anion exchange membranes between the blood and the Pd black surface."
"A numerical approach to obtain the temperature distribution in layered tissues with thermal source and cooling inside the tissues is presented in this paper. This approach can be applied to problems with a distributed internal thermal source produced by external radiation such as microwave, ultrasound, and shortwave, or by internal increase of metabolic rate in live subjects. The exact mechanism of cooling is not discussed here, but it is assumed to be due to blood flow in vivo. The calculation of the temperature distribution in layered tissues is based on a linear model of the tissues that consists of several layers of different kinds of tissues separated by parallel boundaries. Some simple mathematical forms of the cooling functions are also assumed in this paper. The results obtained agree well with six available experiments."
"One of the major problems encountered in recording ECG's is the appearance of unwanted 60-Hz interference in the output. This paper examines the many possible sources of interference, and for each provides a description, an identifying test, and a remedy. Then we look at possible equipment imperfections and guidelines for amplifier design to aid in the evaluation of new developments in the field of electrocardiography. As an illustrative example, we apply the procedure for isolating the source of interference to an exposition display in which each visitor could rapidly view his own ECG."
"A thin-diaphragm piezoresistive pressure sensor for biomedical instrumentation has been developed using monolithic integratedcircuit (IC) techniques. The piezoresistive effect has been chosen for this device because it provides an observable resistance change that is a linear function of pressure and is observable at low stress levels. A diaphragm is used as a stress magnifying device; its magnification is proportional to the square of the ratio of the diaphragm diameter to its thickness. The pressure-induced stresses in the diaphragm are sensed by properly oriented piezoresistors interconnected to form a bridge."
"A network model of ventricular function consisting of a source of pressure with a series internal resistance that is coupled to a load resistance is presented. It is used as an analog of left ventricular (LV) function during the ejection phase of the cardiac cycle in order to quantitate the interaction of ventricle and load."
"A bimorph linear motor within a closed-loop control system is used to thrust microelectrodes through cell membranes. Penetration distances are programmed in the microscopic field of view by a controlled displacement of the microelectrode, away from a selected membrane surface, to a distance equal and opposite to the intended penetration on the other side of the membrane. These characteristics improve penetration against mechanical resistance such as plant cell walls."
"Reports of behavioral and electrophysiological changes in response to low-level UHF-microwave irradiation are not easily reconciled with known biophysical mechanisms. Effects at incident power densities on the order of 10 mW/cm2 or less would imply either enhanced sensitivity of the nervous system to induced thermal loads or the existence of stronger nonthermal modes of interaction than hitherto proposed. In this paper, a hypothesis is developed that accounts for a class of such reportedly nonthermal effects. It is proposed that absorbed electromagnetic (EM) radiation yields thermal gradients within the semicircular canals of the labyrinth. The intravestibular convective torque induced thereby would mimic natural vestibular simulation. Detection and nystagmus thresholds with corresponding response latencies for human adults and for monkeys are derived in terms of incident power density. For the former, the detection threshold is estimated to be 35 mW/cm2; the threshold may be significantly lower when the possibility of resonance absorption exists, as with cranial radii on the order of 5 cm or less (immature human or small animal). These results imply the existence of a significant caloric vestibular cue at incident power densities that are not otherwise associated with gross thermal effects."
"Uncertainty in locating optimum focus can be a major problem when a scanning microscope is used as an input to a quantitative image-analysis system. Our novel solution to this problem is to maximize the integral of the video light-loss signal above a threshold, when the threshold is arbitrarily set above background and within the range of grayness of the image. This algorithm has been incorporated into a real-time analog device to monitor the quality of focus. The focus-assist device uses IC operational amplifiers and has a bandpass of 0.5 MHz. When the device is used with images of metaphase chromosomes, the standard deviation of optimum focus is reduced to 0.09 μm as contrasted to the unassisted value of 0.37 μm. The device is simple, fast, reliable, and extremely sensitive. It should have general application to both macro- and microscopic scanning systems."
"An electronic model is described which features a multiple input compartmental system analogous to a dendritic net and a simulated action potential. The inputs to the model are rectangular voltage pulses which initiate excitatory and/or inhibitory conductance changes in the dendritic compartments; the outputs are the simulated action potential and a simultaneous rectangular voltage pulse. In addition, the membrane potential at each compartment and the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing conductances can be conveniently monitored."
 "A new formulation is presented for surface potentials produced on a homogeneous spherical volume conductor by an eccentric current dipole contained therein. The formulation is free of interminancies for all relevant dipole locations and leads directly to the solution of surface potentials due to an eccentric quadripole."
"Womersley's theory of oscillatory flow has been used to determine the equivalent viscosity (analogous to the apparent viscosity under steady flow conditions) of plasma and plasma substitutes (dextrans) of various molecular weights in rigid cylindrical tubes of radii ranging from 0.0304 to 0.162 cm. It is shown that the equivalent viscosity of dextran solutions is radius independent and is higher than that of plasma, at all frequencies. The continuum theory of suspensions, developed by Kline and Allen, is shown to be in good agreement with these findings."
"In the situation of a constant vagus impulse rate, Warner's model for vagal stimulation heart rate (HR) control is a linear differential equation. The particular constants in the Warner model that may be explicitly computed from the experimental data and the sensitivity of the simulation of Warner's model to variations in these parameters are determined. The performance of the Warner model and that of a first-order differential equation model are compared with each other and with experimental data. On the basis of this study, it is concluded that Warner's published experimental data are more supportive of a first-order differential equation model for vagal heart control than it is of a second-order model."
"A spectral analysis of single motor unit potentials from the human medial rectus extraocular muscle is described. The analysis was performed by first averaging individual single motor unit potentials and then subjecting the average to Fourier analysis using a digital computer. The portion of the spectrum between 300 Hz and 2.8 kHz has definite bandpass characteristics with -3-dB points for the low-and high-frequency sides equal to 470 Hz and 1.4 kHz, respectively. The spectrum provides some insight into the characteristics of a filter that would provide an indication of the occurrence of single unit potentials in an interference electromyogram."
"Objective urine leakage data are difficult to obtain from the incontinent patient. A system based on the hygroscopic nature of lithium chloride (LiCI) is described, which detects dropwise quantities of water and helps assess the effectiveness of anti-incontinence management programs."
"Hemostasis effected by utilizing whole blood clotting times is difficult because such data currently can be obtained only by lengthy and unreliable means. A rapid new method using a hemotensiometer has been developed that can measure whole blood clotting times accurately. An additional parameter, the clotting strength, can be measured as well. These tests may be performed upon blood that contains no additives or with blood containing anticoagulants such as heparin or buffered citrate. The hemotensiometer has been used successfully to control the dosage of anticoagulants and coagulants in various clinical states. Also, it is useful in diagnosing coagulopathies and following patient recovery from bleeding disorders."

 "A large fraction of medical care is delivered in ambulatory settings. It is a hypothesis of this program that a significant fraction of physician-patient encounters can be safely managed by paramedics with no past medical experience and with a minimum of training (about four weeks), operating under well-defined guidance protocols. The paramedic using the protocols can either substitute for the physician on any given visit, or can perform a substantial prephysician workup, thus saving physician time and enhancing the thoroughness of the patient evaluation."
"Adequate medical care for all who need it is an admirable concept that has been accepted by this country and by the medical profession; yet, until now, there has been no way of reaching that objective. The elimination of user fees is merely an empty promise, creating more losses than gains."
"Neighborhood comprehensive health care centers have become an important model of health care delivery in large metropolitan areas. Constraints in manpower resources dictate the need to explore ways and means by which computer technology can support the activity of health professionals in these centers. The Department of Community Medicine at Baylor has designed and is in the process of implementing a computer support system for a neighborhood health clinic, Casa de Amigos, of the Harris County Hospital District."
"Engineers, pragmatic and ``action''-oriented, are indispensable principal members of the health-care team. The primary role of the biomedical engineer is to provide the conceptual and material tools required to perform medical tasks, i.e., instrumentation for health care."

"A new process is described in which the relation between outcomes of clinical neurological tests and neural pathways is utilized to identify locations of probable lesions. The test outcomes of a clinical neurological examination serve as input to a computer whose output is a map indicating locations of probable malfunction (lesion), as well as locations of probable function. This map involves the display of various factors that are defined to describe the spatial distribution of neural elements involved in probable malfunction or probable function. The process is suitable not only for clinical application but also as a tool for teaching neurosciences. An application of this process to a patient with a brainstem lesion is presented."
"The clinical importance of existing powered prosthetic devices is investigated. In this regard, several powered prosthetic systems that are in practical use are reviewed and put in perspective with respect to body-powered systems. The unique problems of delivery and maintenance of these systems are discussed as are practical design limitations. An appraisal is made of development trends in the field and the author's viewpoint on the optimal environment for practical advances in the field is presented."
"Loss of volitional control of lower urinary tract function follows degenerative neurologic diseases and traumatic spinal cord injury. The development of implantable prosthetic devices for restoring function has evolved over the last ten years from the use of electrical detrusor stimulation to include urethral occlusion and volume sensing capabilities. Further efforts aimed at stimulating normal reflex function are dependent upon a thorough understanding of the biologic constraints and technologic limitations to this engineering design problem. An electromechanical system that circumvents these restrictions is described."
"Many elements for the construction of a health delivery system now exist but they are spotty and diffused. Much effort has been concentrated on primary care affecting 10 percent of the people but ⅓ of the costs of the system. Little attention has been paid to the other elements-prevention, protection, tertiary care, and rehabilitation, although these may eventually have greater effectiveness in improving the system as a whole. Attempts must now be made to combine disparate elements into a total system of health care by interfacing the modular components from several subsystems into a single unit."
"What should be the priorities for health-care technology a decade from now? Given enormous population expansion and pressure, given increased concern with health care, given diminished efficiency of care owing to these overpressures, and given an enticing banquet of sophisticated technology-what should we do now to shape the future, explicitly and deliberately, so that ten years from now we will not regret lost opportunities?"
"The future role for technology in health-care delivery will be greatly affected by the current debate over national health insurance. A study of the various proposals now in Congress reveals that most bills have in common financial incentives to encourage prepaid comprehensive health-care delivery through group practices called health-maintenance organizations (HMO's). Unlike the typical hospital that operates to maximize the quantity, quality and complexity of care provided, HMO's are designed with incentives to keep people well and keep down the costs of providing care. The likely results of their widespread use will be new incentives to invest in technology designed to increase productivity by lowering the unit cost of care."
"Modern health-care delivery is becoming increasingly dependent on the contributions of engineering science and technology. The important and often critical need for such technological support has resulted in the establishment of a clinical engineering role at a number of hospitals. The literature quotes numerous examples of the contributions such a capability can make to the delivery of quality patient care."

"Rapid and accurate measurements of neuronal processes in Golgi preparations are possible with the aid of a small computer (Glaser and Van der Loos, 1965). This paper describes a system for doing this, using a small digital computer which controls stepping motors (0.5-μm steps) attached to the stage (x, y axes) and fine focus (z axis) of a microscope. The observer tracks the processes, topological information, such as the location of the soma, dendritic origins, branch points, and ends of processes, is signaled to the computer by special controls, and the x, y, and z coordinates of each are stored in digital format. The computer printout yields 1) individual x, y, and z coordinates with associated topological identifiers; 2) quantitative data for each dendritic segment in order (i.e., primary and secondary branches, etc.); and 3) computes the actual linear dimensions of each segment in microns. An associated oscilloscope display can 1) display the whole neuron, or individual processes, by connecting recorded points by vectors; 2) identify each dendrite; 3) rotate (continuously or by a specified angle) the whole cell, or individual dendrites, around any selected point or axis; and 4) indicate spatial relationships by dynamic rotation, intensity modulation, or stereo pairs. The performance of this system has been evaluated for accuracy and the repeatability of measurements."
"An algorithm for the automatic computation of the cardiothoracic ratio is presented. In experiments using 100 sheets of 14-by 14-in postero-anterior chest radiographs, a tolerable error of ±4 percent was satisfied in 86 percent of all trials. The processing time is about 1 s. The goal of this study is to provide radiologists with practical Instruments for the automated mass screening of heart disease. A minicomputer and a conventional vidicon camera are used in the experimental system."
"A platinum-glass microelectrode has been developed that permits chronic recording from single cortical neurons in unrestrained animals and without benefit of external manipulation. Details of fabrication and the surgical technique involved are presented. A discussion of the relevant mechanical considerations is also included. A prime advantage of the method is the ease with which it may be realized in the standard neurophysiologic laboratory."
"To obtain chronic recordings from single nerve cells in the cerebral cortex it is necessary to prevent motion of the microelectrode tip with respect to the adjacent neural tissue. This paper presents an engineering analysis to estimate these motions in terms of the geometry and material properties of the electrode, its lead wire, and the cortex. The results are used to gain an understanding of a recently reported successful recording system, and to thereby provide a design guide for future systems. In addition, a buckling analysis is presented for a class of microelectrodes to enable a minimum size to be achieved with an adequate safety margin."
"A method is developed for analyzing sudden injection dye (tracer) curves in order to obtain the distribution of first passage times in the mammalian circulation. The moments of the distribution yield useful quantities such as circulating blood volume. The method involves the use of Liouville-Neumann series. The calculation of the first passage time distribution (FPD) also requires a deconvolution through the use of Fourier transforms, but the calculation of moments does not."
"Synchronous excitation of an ensemble of elements in the nervous system generates field potentials in and around the ensemble. Experimental analysis of these potentials can provide information about neuronal function."
"A technique for computer reassembly and plotting of morphological serial sections in three dimensions is described. The computer reconstruction is obtained at a savings in cost and time compared to previous model-processing or isometric drawing methods."
"Microelectrodes fabricated using integrated-circuit technology are shown to be suitable for extracellular single-unit recording, and the factors influencing electrode-cell coupling are discussed. Electrode tip size as well as location is found to be critical in recording high spike amplitudes, suggesting that the paths for current flow in central nervous system (CNS) tissue may be extremely small."
"The selection of tungsten microelectrodes for cellular-level recordings is frequently based on simple testing techniques, such as microscopic examination and generation of gas bubbles on the exposed tip. A rapid technique, whereby the relative impedance magnitude may be determined using swept frequencies, is described."
"A displacement transducer employing the Hall effect is discussed. The leakage flux density of a permanent magnet is sensed and converted to an output voltage by a Hall crystal providing a low force, undirectional, biological displacement transducer. This device was used to monitor topographical movement of the urinary bladder in dogs and cats during isovolumetric reflex activity, and the results are reported and discussed."
"A capacitive-type electrode using barium titanate ceramics is described. This electrode is not affected by the polarization potential. Because its surface is chemically inactive and mechanically strong, its noise voltage is minimum from the beginning of its installation. This device is especially suitable for EEG recording."
"A definition of an amplitude discriminator is given. Based upon this definition, a highly selective amplitude discriminator is then realized according to a proposed block diagram of the model."
"Thermal-power output of destructive therapeutic implants composed of nickel-palladium Curie alloys or 430 stainless steel (a few watts in typical use) is presented. Eddy-current models of implant heating are discussed. A field strength of about 5000 A/m-1 is shown to be appropriate for seeds of about 2-mm OD."
"A differential amplitude or window discriminator is described which employs inexpensive integrated circuits and performs over an extremely wide frequency range (5 Hz-100 kHz for a sine-wave input). The discriminator can be employed in neurological studies, such as the separation of action potentials obtained from microelectrode recordings. Accessory circuits are also described which allow pulse rate to voltage conversion, and simultaneous observation on a single-channel oscilloscope of threshold levels, input signal, and discriminator output."
"General testing procedures which will ascertain whether a Doppler ultrasonic blood flowmeter is correctly designed and operating properly are presented. A commercial Doppler ultrasonic blood flowmeter using the procedure is evaluated. Two pitfalls were encountered which prevented its proper operation. High-frequency response was inadequate, which introduced a nonlinearity into the input-output calibration curve. Low-frequency gain was too high, resulting in wall-motion artifacts. These problem areas are described in detail, and a remedy for each is suggested."
"Although respiratory rate is a desirable patient parameter to monitor, signals from a spontaneously breathing patient are so irregular that reliable counts have been difficult. This short communication describes a circuit that processes the signal produced by a respiratory transducer (in our case an impedance pneumograph), and provides a countable output to a digital rate monitor. It is relatively simple, but embodies complex decision criteria in identifying respiratory activity."
"A method for the in vivo detection of pulsatile blood velocity in transilluminated microvessels using data contained in single photometric signals is described. The system design is based on the assumption that pulsatile velocity information is contained in frequency- modulated components of the photometric signal spectrum. Results are in agreement with a previously reported cross-correlation technique utilized to measure the time delay between signals from upstream and downstream photodetectors aligned in the direction of flow."
"A microminiature pressure transducer is described utilizing a variable air capacitor driven by a pressure-sensitive deflectible silicon membrane as the detection mechanism. Silicon integrated circuit technology is used throughout for economical batch fabrication of the device. Prototype devices have been fabricated and initial test results under static pressure conditions are reported. Equivalent gauge factors of over 500 for this variable capacitance device are about a factor of 5-10 better than the best theoretically designed silicon strain gauges in the size range necessary for catheter insertion. Temperature independence and increased linearity are also important advantages of this variable capacitance sensor head."

 "Radioisotope powered cardiac pacemakers have been in human clinical evaluation for over three years. The power supply of these units was developed in response to the need voiced by the medical community for pulse generators with longer lifetimes and more predictable performance characteristics than the conventional pulse generators which are powered by chemical cells. This thermoelectric power supply has Pu-238 as a source of thermal energy and a bismuth-telluride thermopile to generate electrical energy by the Seebeck effect. Over 650 of these radioisotopic power supplies have been built since 1968. By May 1, 1973, 260 of them had been incorporated into pulse generators and implanted in patients. All of the isotopic pulse generators and their power supplies are still functioning. Theoretical calculations predict that the radioisotopic power supply will reliably power a pulse generator for ten or more years, and clinical experience lends credence to these calculations. Progress is being made in modifying U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (USAEC) regulations which currently restrict the use of Pu-238 powered medical devices in the United States. The excellent clinical performance of the isotopic pulse generator and its acceptance by the medical profession in Europe indicate that this device has a promising future."
"Implantable cardiac pacemakers are currently powered by mercury batteries. These cells have approximately 50-percent reliability for 2-year operation in this application. The patient has an expected lifetime of five and one-half years. Thus the cardiac pacemaker must be replaced several times during the patient's lifetime."
"A number of cathode and anode materials for an implantable hybrid biogalvanic fuel cell have been evaluated. Results of in vitro polarization tests and in vivo experiments with a voltagesensing transmitter are presented. Experiments performed in an artificial interstitial-fluid (AIF) electrolyte are also discussed. A Pt activated-carbon cathode and zinc anode have exhibited the most suitable characteristics when all aspects of this type of power source are considered. This electrode pair has been used to power a cardiac pacemaker in two dogs with surgically created A-V blocks."
"An implantable power source for driving a pacemaker consisting of a hybrid cell utilizing a sacrificial porous aluminum anode and a catalytic cathode for reducing oxygen is considered. Porous aluminum anodes show a significant improvement in polarization over a solid aluminum anode under in vitro transient operating conditions found with certain types of pacemakers. However, the in vivo transient behavior of porous aluminum anodes is only slightly better than solid aluminum anodes. Using in vivo and in vitro linear polarization studies, the corrosion of solid aluminum has been determined to be more than an order of magnitude less than that of solid zinc. The weight loss of aluminum due to corrosion is less than 3.0 percent that of the aluminum needed to supply the faradaic current to the pacemaker. A hybrid cell consisting of an aluminum anode and a porous palladium-black cathode has powered a commercially available pacemaker. Further histopathologic evaluation of tissues surrounding anodes is needed before selecting either zinc or aluminum as an anode material."
"Batteries that power implanted cardiac pacemakers deteriorate because of energy drain and permeation of body fluids. They must, therefore, be replaced periodically, most often by means of an operation. In this paper, the stimulating waveform that draws the least amount of energy from the battery and also delivers the minimum energy to a heart cell is derived. It is shown that a 31-percent reduction in energy (with respect to that required by the standard rectangular pulse) can be achieved if the pulse duration is about twice the cell time constant. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the required energy is insensitive to pulse-duration variations (due to component changes). An easily synthesized suboptimal approximation is developed and requires only slightly more energy than the optimal pulse."
"Using pacemakers implanted in canines with surgically induced atrioventricular blocks, the effects of the microwave-oven frequencies (915 and 2450 MHz) and two radar frequencies (2810 and 3050 MHz) were evaluated. Quantitative evaluation of these fields with respect to complete inhibition of pacemakers can be made. A narrow zone of inhibition during some exposures-a ``window'' effect-not previously described is reported. The following field parameters would be regarded as potential situations for complete pacemaker inhibition: 1) 915-MHz-fields continuous- and sine-wave modulation at 120 Hz in field strengths over 75 V/m, and 2) fields at either 2810 or 3050 MHz pulsed at a rate of 40 pulses per second (pps) or less with a field strength greater than 250 V/m."
"Acupuncture may be viewed as an ancient art of skin diagnosis and therapy. It is based on the assumption that internal disorders are reflected in changes in certain points of the skin. About a thousand of such points have been mapped through the centuries, each 1 or 2 mm in diameter. These acupuncture points are considered to form groups, each group being arranged along a line, a so-called meridian, which is associated with an internal organ. Each of the 12 basic meridians runs along a major part of the body and terminates at a fingertip or a toe. Meridians, organs, and diseases are distinguished in two groups: Yang and Yin [1]."
"Electrocardiographic (ECG) signals were recorded from ten normal resting male subjects using two bipolar lead configurations: sternal and axillary. The recordings were made under low-noise conditions with a recording system bandpass extending from dc to 10 kHz. The ECG data were digitized and spectrally analyzed using a fast Fourier transform (FFT). The spectral analysis included both single ECG cycles and averaged ECG cycles. Slight differences were found between the averaged sternal and axillary ECG spectra in the low-frequency highamplitude range. An overall mean spectrum was produced as a bound for the normal resting male ECG spectrum as encountered in this study. The maximum value of this spectrum occurred at the fundamental (1.22 Hz); it had a -20-dB point at 36 Hz, -40-dB at 105 Hz, and -60-dB at 300 Hz. To investigate the effects of band-limiting on the ECG, an ideal digital filter was implemented using the FFT. It was found that waveform notching is caused by frequencies over a wide passband, waveform amplitude information extends only to 200 Hz, and waveform duration information lies below 60 Hz."
"Fourier-Bessel expansions and Fourier series are used to represent the average evoked cortical potentials obtained by stimulation of the olfactory tract in cats. The applicability of various mathematical representations of potentials to the modeling of neural systems is discussed."
"The serial correlogram (SCG) is used to determine the amount of dependence in spike-interval sequences. This communication demonstrates the effects of measurement errors [i.e., false alarms (FA's) and false dismissals (FD's) in spike-detection algorithms] on correlation coefficients when the sequence has a practical sample size."
"A low-impedance (0-3-3.0 MΩ at 1.0 kHz) reliable tungsten microelectrode has been developed. The electrode I easily reproducible, and single electrodes have been successfully used in repeated recordings from sensory ganglia."
"An electrically floating platinized-platinum (Pt-Pt) wire within the length of a long (3-cm) electrolyte-filled glass capillary (100μ diam), which is used to monitor the internal potential in large axons, eliminates cable effects and lowers the effective electrode impedance to < 10 kΩ. With this low-source-impedance capillary electrode; absolute transmembrane potentials can be recorded and a fast-responding (0.5-μs) voltage-clamp system is obtained."
"An oxygenator which consists of three side-by-side silicone rubber tubes contained in coiled glass tubing is described for use with a small organ perfusion system. The oxygenator has good permeability characteristics for both O2 and CO2 with rates of gas transfer which can be varied over a wide range. There was a linear increase in O2 transfer with increasing perfusate blood-flow rates tested up to 76 ml/min. This represented an O2-transfer increment of 0.026-ml O2/ml flow. The tm=1/2 for 14CO2 washout was 8.5 min at a flow rate of 76 ml/min."
"A digital principle is described which permits a linear regulation of gas flow rate. The regulator unit consists of a set of on-off valves connected to parallel flow resistors. The conductivities of the resistors are 1, 2, 4, 8,...,n and combinations of the resisters give the flow rates 1, 2, 3, 4,..., 2n -1. thus a stepwise regulation with a unit step of less then 1 percent of the maximal flow rate can be obtained by a step of 7 values and resisters. By using two ways valus and complementing with a second gas, binary mixtures of controlled composition (molor fraction) are produced. An apparatus is described which utilizes the above principle for mixing oxygen and nitrogen. The flow resisters are made of plastic tubing, and magentic values are used to permit electric control. The limitations of the applicability of tubler resistors due to nonlinear phenomena are discussed."
"Development of a thermally sensitive contact lens consisting of a laminated liquid-crystal layer is described. This device, useful in a variety of applications, presents a novel approach to the noninvasive in vivo measurement of comeal surface temperatures."
"A hemodensitometer (photoelectric plethysmograph) has been utilized to sense the perfusion pulse at the plantar surface of the arch of the foot of premature babies. The sensed pulse-wave signal is then passed through a low-pass filter and then recorded. The resultant signal correlated well with the nasal mask respiration signal."
"A unity-gain buffer amplifier with an input capacity below 0.01 pF and an input resistance above 1012 Ω is described. Low input capacity is achieved without the necessity of feedback adjustments by bootstrapping the entire input stage, including power sources and shielding. The amplifier is of simple design and is based around commercially available operational amplifiers."

"A mathematical model has been derived that describes the pressure-flow relationship in the ventilatory system under conditions of constant lung volume. The parameters of the model include small airway resistance, large airway resistance, and lung elastic recoil. A collapsible airway segment is included to model compression of the airways during expiration."
"A closed-loop control scheme for the control of intra-aortic balloon pumping has been developed and tested in dog experiments. A performance index reflecting the general objectives of balloon-assist pumping is developed and a modified steepest ascent control algorithm is utilized for the selection of a proper operating point for the balloon during its pumping cycle. This paper attempts to indicate the feasibility of closed-loop control of balloon pumping, and particularly its flexibility in achieving both diastolic augmentation of mean aortic pressure and control of the level of end-diastolic pressure (EDP)-an important factor in reducing heart work."
"A cardiac cineangiogram is an X-ray motion picture of the heart. Boundary detection is an essential task to compute valuable quantitative information such as the temporal volume change and the wall velocity. Previously, boundary detection methods treated frames independent of each other. Consecutive frames of a motion picture are, however, highly correlated and therefore this property can be exploited. The method described takes advantage of the known location of the boundary on previous frames. The previous boundary is divided into a set of segments along which local rectangular regions are set up on the present frame. This boundary is approximated by a set of straight lines which minimize the square error in each rectangular region with the spatial derivative as its weight. The method is a fast computing algorithm and relatively insensitive to white noise because the resultant positive and negative weights tend to cancel this effect. An experiment was carried out, and good agreement with boundaries detected by humans was obtained."
"Monoplane angiocardiographic methods are widely used to measure left-ventricular volumes (LVV's). Generally, the ellipsoid and Simpson's rule models are used to calculate LVV. Due to the assumed circular cross-sectional area of the left ventricle, both models have a fundamental error which theoretically prohibits the exact calculation of LVV. In this paper, a method to reduce this fundamental error is suggested whereby the LVV is calculated by Simpson's rule, but with each truncated cone or frustum multiplied by a correction factor to relate the assumed circular cross-sectional area to the true cross-sectional area of the frustum. The developed correction-factor technique is compared to the currently used ellipsoid and the Simpson's rule models for 18 canine left-ventricular casts, and the results show that the correction-factor technique has a greater accuracy than any of the conventional methods."
"Echocardiography is today well established and has gained widespread acceptance as a clinical routine method, especially for the diagnosis of mitral valve stenosis. Since heart structure movements are relatively fast, only information of limited medical value can be obtained from direct inspection of the A-scope display. Ideally, an apparatus for recording the movements of heart structures in the form of curves should record multiple reflected echoes and should also be able to record simultaneously other heart parameters such as ECG, phonocardiogram, or blood pressure."
"The dynamic changes in pressures, flow, and transcapillary fluid exchange which occur in the isolated dog hindlimb in response to a sudden increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure were simulated on a digital computer. The differential equation with time-varying parameters was set in the state-space form and the transient solution was found by means of the matrix exponential technique. The close approximation of the simulated curves with recorded phenomenon suggests that this technique may be useful in providing further insight into factors which are major variables controlling the fluid equilibrium in mammalian tissue, but are currently not possible to measure directly."
"The control functions, system motions, and other characteristics which are obtained from the mathematical synthesis of ``optimal'' bipedal locomotion gaits with respect to locomotion criteria (to be minimized) defined in the paper are considered. Results are presented for three mathematical biped models and several locomotion criteria (objective functions). Optimal walking trajectories and associated control functions are synthesized using the optimal programming method of [1]. In the synthesis approach, the model structure and locomotion criterion determine the optimal controls motion and foot placement parameters. These effects are examined, and qualitative comparisons to human walking patterns are suggested. These studies also provide quantitative information for the design of prostheses and walking machines, for example: ranges of suitable motion patterns (as functions of time) and magnitudes of controlling efforts and energy requirements."
"A statistical technique is described which allows description of the statistical characteristics of nonstationary electroencephalograms (EEG's). The EEG is investigated in terms of its nonstationary power spectrum. The instantaneous power spectra of certain transition processes in the EEG (the evolution and blocking of the alpha wave) are calculated and described on the time-frequency plane."
"This machine uses the one-to-one correspondence between spelled-speech utterances and the printed alphabet symbols. Letter recognition was done by first extracting essential features from the information picked up by a photocell scanner and then matching these features with a stored set of data. In order to reduce the amount of memory required to generate letter sounds, redundant phonemes were eliminated and a selected set of basic phonemes was extracted by a segmentation process. Letter sounds were then synthesized by concatenation of these basic phonemes. Also vowels and vowel-like sounds have quasi-periodic waveforms. These sounds were reproduced satisfactorily by repeating over and over again a pitch period extracted from the original waveforms. These algorithms of letter and phoneme synthesis offer considerable saving of memory space and cost in constructing a digital spelled-speech reading machine for the blind. Further reduction in memory storage was accomplished by an encoding scheme. For the experiments, a computer was used to synthesize the letter sounds and to simulate this machine. Experimental results indicated that blind subjects could read spelled sentences between 60 and 70 words/m with 90-percent correct intelligibility after only 1 h of contact with the letter sounds."

"This paper reports the threshold 60-Hz alternating-current values required to induce ventricular fibrillation when the current is applied to electrodes at different sites on the surface of the bodies of rabbits, puppies, one monkey, dogs, goats, and ponies. It is shown that for a given body weight, the duration of exposure to current influences the fibrillation threshold; exposure times shorter than 1 s require more current. For a given duration of current flow, the threshold current for fibrillation is a function of body weight and electrode location. The lowest current for fibrillation was required with lead III (left forelimb-left hindlimb) and lead I (right-left forelimbs) required the highest current. For a 5-s exposure, the threshold current for fibrillation varies almost as the square root of body weight (W), the general expression being I = KWα, where α is nearly 0.5. Values for K and α are presented for leads I, II, and III."
"A digital beat-to-beat and integrating cardiotachometer which calculates heart rate digitally in a simple manner has been constructed. The device needs no calibration and has an operating range from 1 to 999 beats/min with an accuracy of ±½ digit, and will calculate heart rate either on a beat-to-beat basis or averaged over 10, 20, or 50 beats."
"A device has been designed and constructed to cause stimulation of neural tissue by means of an induced electric field. Such a device is interesting because it allows a neural structure to be stimulated without requiring either the surgical exposure of the site of stimulation or requiring that current be passed from the outside to the inside of the living system. Tests have been conducted at stimulation rates of 45 pulses per second (pps) but the system can be adapted to provide rates up to 125 pps."

"Digital simulation of a model reference adaptive control scheme for long-term ventilation of the lungs is presented. This adaptive scheme is capable of bringing the instantaneous alveolar pressure of the patient to its normal level within one inspiration period, following a possible change in the patient's respiratory parameters (i.e., airway resistances or lung and chest wall compliances)."

 "An Impatt diode oscillator using a circuit as proposed by Kurokawa and Magelhaes1) is described on the basis of a practical equivalent circuit. Conditions for maximum output power and low oscillator noise are derived and compared with experimental results. Using a Si n+pp+ diode an rms frequency deviation of 0.8 Hz (in 100 Hz at 200 kHz) at 10 GHz has been obtained."
                                   "Measuring results of large-signal impedance, ac voltage and Io-Vo characteristics (Vo and Io dc voltage and current resp.) on X-band Si Impatt diodes in pulse operation show that the efficiency is limited by saturation of the ae voltage at about 0.25 Vo, independent of the de current and the diode impedance. On reaching this saturation value the Io-Vo curve and the output curve show a knee, indicating the onset of an instability. The effect is explained by taking into account the influence of leakage currents caused by impact ionisation in the drift region on the Io-Vo curves at constant ac voltage."

A novel filter circuit is used to combine the local oscillator and the signal with low insertion loss in the signal path. The measured single sideband noise figure of the RF receiver at 30 GHz is 4.7 dB and the rms FM frequency variation due to the local oscillator is 168 Hz/√khz."
          "Designing microwave bandpass filters attenuation poles at finite frequencies as well as group delay requirements can be achieved by providing additional couplings between non-adjacent resonators.

  "The propagation of electromagnetic surface waves along a radially inhomogeneous dielectric waveguide is investigated. As far as the rigorous solution of this problem is concerned, little is known in the literature. In the present paper a rigorous approach to the problem has been adopted resulting into a system of four coupled first order differential equations for the transverse field components. In the inhomogeneous core these equations have been solved either by direct numerical integration or by substitution of a power series expansion. This approach is applied to the propagation of surface wave modes along radially inhomogeneous single-mode fibres. Although not applicable to fibres of the Selfoc-type, it is found that our approach (especially the one that involves the power series expansion) leads to very accurate results for values of k0a = 2πa/λ0 (a = radius of the core, λ0 = wavelength in free space) up to 250 in relatively short computing times."

              "The present paper is devoted to a study of displacement effect on a slot line structure. shown a broad frequency band of operation. An described. non reciprocal devices using a field First experimental results have isolator and a 4-port circulator are It is well known that the dominant mode on a slot line exhibits regions where the magnetic field is elliptically polarized, both in the substrate and in the air outside the substrate. It is possible to turn to good account this particularity for the design of non reciprocal microwave components, such as isolators, using a resonance effect. However, such a device does not offer a broad frequency band of operation. Other experiments achieved on various geometries of slot lines on a ferrimagnetic substrate have shown that it is possible to obtain a non reciprocal behaviour on a broad frequency band and this characteristic allows us to distinguish this mode of operation from the resonant one. To obtain this effect, a suitable choice of the slot line and substrate geometry and ferrimagnetic material is necessary. A field displacement effect then appears on a broad band (more than an octave). The direct wave is travelling along the slot line while the reverse one is travelling on the opposite side of the substrate. It is now possible to absorbe this reverse wave by the means of a lossy dielectric material or a ferrite used in a lossy region of polarization (figure 1)."
"We present a theoretical optimization of reciprocal ferrite phasers using a TE11 circular waveguide. These are the Dual Mode Phaser (DMP) and the Polarization Insensitive Phaser (PIP.) both being largely employed in the array antenna systems. We have proposed an example of a general method for the theoretical ferrite phasers optimization which permits, from a first selection of dielectrics and ferrites, to determine the best choice of materials and the well suited geometry of the device. The optimum structure being determined, we can complete the study of the propagation by giving the fields configuration, the power flow and the absorbed power distributions."

The semiconductor devices are MOSFET N and P-channel inversion layers, the channel length is along the direction of the wave propagation and many elementary detectors have been disposed along the propagation path in order to realize tapped delay lines. Theoretical and experimental results are given for the conversion efficiency, bandwidth, sensitivity and dynamic range for a single N or P channel device. Results are presented also for an array of detectors operating as a variable delay line and as a correlator for a 50 MHz bit rate waveform."

  "This paper describes an experimental investigation of a simple method of achieving a limited degree of electronic tuning in medium power magnetrons, originally proposed by Willshaw(l). By the insertion of an extra cathode in one (or more) of the block resonators, ancillary crossed-field diodes are formed which can be used to modulate the magnetron frequency by pulsing the current taken by the diodes. Initial experiments with a 100kW X-band magnetron showed small frequency shifts of a few MHz per tuning cathode. Experiments still in progress with a moveable cathode in a passive, driven, resonator, suggest that 10MHz tuning in an S-band magnetron should be feasible corresponding to 30MHz at X-band."

The problems of foreign equipment are of the same type and magnitude as United States equipment.

"The principle of the gearless drive has already been applied to some large mills. A synchronous motor is ``wrapped'' directly around the mill cylinder and supplied by a thyristor frequency converter at approximately 10-percent system frequency. The drive thus operates at the low mill speed and dispenses with interposed gearing."
"This paper examines the dynamic behavior of electrical drives with double-gain parametric perturbations, i.e., one perturbation in the drive and the second in the adaptive controller. A typical variation of the drive gain is assumed, and the influence of the variation of the parameters on the transient processes of the electrical drive is estimated."

Approximately four years ago a working group was formed to study the application and specification of fuses for semiconductor devices and to establish testing procedure, and basis of rating of such fuses."
"An analytical approach is described for determining the parameters for an autotransformer-capacitor phase converter that allows matching of the converter to a specific motor for a given load. Equations are developed for the capacitor size and autotransformer turns ratio that will give balanced operation of a three-phase motor. Predicted values are compared with the experimental results."
"The phase control methods of regulating ac power to consumer products is quite common. Households contain these circuits in diverse places from wall lamp dimmers to dad's variable speed electric drill and mom's electric blender. Common to all these controls is the triac, semiconductor ac switch, and the associated trigger circuit which provides the ``brains'' of the control. The trigger, or ``brain'', portion of the phase control circuit commonly utilizes a resistor capacitor network which, in combination with a voltage thresholds switch device, provides a time delay between the beginning of each half-cycle and the time the triac is triggered, i.e., shortens the portion of time power is supplied the appliance. This time delay is programmed by the resistor value, lower resistor values allowing the capacitor to charge faster, and reach the voltage threshold faster, which triggers the triac earlier in the half-cycle and applies power to the appliance for a greater portion of the half-cycle."
"A new type of electrically energized linear actuator has been developed for the appliance industry which offers high-force output from a small inexpensive package. The new linear actuator uses a single solid-state component to control the operation of the device. The actuator's response is noninstantaneous, which allows it to be used in designs where time delay is required or where rapid response is unnecessary. Its size, mounting options, and cost are comparable to a low-cost solenoid. However, the force output of this device exceeds by an order of magnitude or more the force output of a solenoid of the same size. Unlike a solenoid, the actuator's force output does not change with ambient or voltage variations, and its high-force output does not vary over its stroke. When compared with a solenoid of approximately the same force output capability, the actuator operates on less than one-tenth the steady-state power consumption. The actuator can be operated in the push, push-pull, or pull mode. For example, a unit 1 in in diameter and 2 in long, weighing about 1.5 oz can operate against a 12 lb external load over its entire 0.250-in stroke. Because of its unique operating parameters, it can be successfully adapted to applications where solenoids, gear motors, pneumatic actuators, and other conventional actuators will not do the job, or as a low-cost replacement for a high-force actuator."
"A new proportional temperature control circuit that uses a unique thermistor oscillator as the temperature sensing element is discussed. A series connected positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistor and negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor form an electrothermal relaxation oscillator. The environmental temperatures which the thermistors experience determine the amplitude and frequency of the oscillator. Coupling the oscillator with a thyristor and using the temperature dependence of the oscillator, proportional temperature control can be achieved."

Typical leakage currents are presented, and the effects of temperature, humidity, grounding, bonding, and circuit conditions on the measured values are discussed. Information on the measurement instrument, its frequency response, input impedance, and sensing characteristics is given."
"Both in its initial concept and in its present form, the induction range has many desirable features when compared to conventional ranges. These are readily demonstrable by its superior thermal response, its convenience, and safety. All these attributes are possible because the use of electromagnetic induction permits the pan to be heated directly without heating the range surface first."
"The trend to underground distribution construction provides relief from some causes of service interruption, but in certain areas service interruptions are then possible due to pocket gopher damage. The protection of underground distribution lines against pocket gophers is accomplished by the use of a chemical, termed R-55® Repellent. Water solutions of this chemical are applied to an earth envelope about the installation which provides a repellent barrier to pocket gophers. Applications of the repellent solution are not complicated, especially when a recently developed device is used for plow-in installations. This chemical has been proven effective by controlled field tests, cooperative field trials, and commercial use over a period of years and is approved for use in this application. No significant resistivity or physical changes were noted in tests where water solutions of the repellent were applied on thermoplastic semiconducting insulation shielding. It is recommended as a low-cost effective method for the reduction of service interruptions due to pocket gophers."
"For estimating the rates of guy anchor corrosion, four tests are suggested, namely 1) earth resistivity, 2) guy current, 3) grid-to-earth potential, and 4) polarizing current. An analysis of test results will give the degree of corrosion and the form of correction necessary."
"This paper introduces an effective method for rural electrical systems planning. All three-phase, two-phase, and single-phase lines are simulated in one computer study. Typical load flow results are obtained from the study. The method emphasizes simplicity and flexibility. Very little computation time is required. Once the data are prepared the amount of work required to incorporate the changing of the system is small and very inexpensive. This type of flexibility is one of the most important contributions of this new method. The method applies to both long-range and short-term system planning."

 "The 1971 edition of the National Electrical Code contains over 500 revisions of the rules in the previous (1968) edition. This paper is confined to a discussion of only those revisions which are of importance to electrical installations in industrial plants. New wiring methods which have been recognized are described along with new requirements for the protection of motors, transformers, services, electrical equipment in hazardous locations, and the installation of temporary wiring."
"This paper will trace the evolution of uninterruptible power systems (UPS) from their beginning to the present time and will take a look at possible future systems and requirements. UPS have undergone tremendous changes in the past 20 years and have not yet reached anything resembling a static condition with regard to design and development. The need for UPS will continue to grow rapidly in the next decade and will require systems of even greater capacity and sophistication than those supplied in the past. The need will remain, however, for UPS that are 100-percent reliable and require little or no maintenance."

"Guides are presented to facilitate proper economic lightning protection of industrial power system component arrangements. Basic concepts of the traveling wave nature of lightning are included to enhance understanding of protective practices as they have developed and emphasize the need for careful adherence to approved practices in critical areas. The grounding treatment is very brief, being limited to the most salient considerations of equipment grounding in relation to the overall lightning protective system and the ground fault protective system. The paper is referenced throughout to current industry standards, application guides, and codes."
"Grounded and ungrounded systems are in general use in both commercial and industrial distribution systems. Proponents of each type of system have established valid points to defend their position. This paper briefly identifies the types of systems in use in each category and lists some of the main advantages and disadvantages of each. With the advent of higher voltage levels in our low-voltage distribution systems and the trend towards solidly grounded systems, problems resulting from the lack of proper ground fault protective devices have caused some severe equipment burndowns. The need for adequate protection has been recognized by the 1971 National Electric Code. This recognition is being complemented by Underwriters' Laboratories with the introduction of appropriate standards. With the passing of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, more emphasis than ever before will be placed on adherence to the preceding code and standards. This paper will review the various methods of detecting ground faults using static devices and describe some of the equipment available for these applications."
"Recently installed cold rolling mills use much new automation machinery. This paper evaluates five automation systems commonly used on eight recently installed cold mills. Key parts of several of the schemes are explained in detail. Field results of the systems are reported, together with suggestions for future designs. Automatic slow-down, main drive spindle positioning, entry end coil handling, interstand equipment, and delivery end coil handling are the five automation systems evaluated. The Appendix explains in detail the operation of three electrical circuits used in these schemes."
"Modern magnetic materials of the Alnico® type have made it practical to build dc motors in larger sizes with permanent magnet fields. The motor manufacturers now market motors to 100 hp at 230-V dc with dimensions, speeds, horsepower ratings, and other characteristics equivalent to the Association of Iron and Steel Engineers (AISE) Standard Mill Type Motors. Previously, smaller motors of this type have come into common usage as table motors. The first large-scale industrial application of these larger motors was at Republic Steel's 84-in hot strip mill in Cleveland, Ohio. This paper reviews the application of these motors on this mill. It discusses application limitations based on design characteristics, the economics of their use, and their performance and service."
"This paper will deal with various methods of torque control for two-drum winders, some that have been more common in the past and others that have come into use in recent years. Before looking into specific methods of torque control, consideration will be given as to just what function the winder (any winder) performs, the type of operation required on two drum winders to accomplish this function, and how torque control can give this desired operation. Other factors influencing the quality of the rewound roll such as sheet quality, back-stand tension control, and rider roll pressure control will be discussed briefly. Areas (including grades and quality of web) where high back-stand tension or rider roll pressure cannot be utilized for roll density and therefore roll quality will be explained to emphasize the need for positive dependable torque control. Various methods of torque control will be considered along with advantages and disadvantages of each. Finally, results of automatic torque control for two specific installations will be discussed indicating the improved roll quality and ease of operation that has been obtained."
"Noise and its effects on hearing preservation, working efficiency, and related physiological and psychological areas has resulted in legislation and motor specifications wherein maximum airborne noise level limits are imposed. Traditionally, motor noise levels have been specified by the purchaser and guaranteed and tested for by the manufacturer with the motor operating at no load, with rated voltage and frequency applied and having a ``soft'' environment surrounding the machine. Ideally, motor noise levels under load in the actual installation environment are the performance data required. This paper presents test data intending to concretely answer at least one of the unknowns-that being the change in motor noise level between no-load and full-load operation within a defined environment. Compelling data are also advanced on the effects of the acoustic environment on noise measurements."
"The practical application of a portion of a theory of ``multisegmental rotor bar analysis'' as recently published by Diamant [1] is described. A special rotor bar-slot configuration was developed and patented to improve the accelerating torque of several large high-speed motors. Manufacturing considerations associated with this shape are described in detail. Because of several limitations inherent in existing test facilities, special test equipment and methods were then devised to confirm the degree of improvement; these have since been successfully applied to other machines as well."
"A variable speed drive, which includes a prime mover driven alternator, a 36-SCR cycloconverter, and an induction motor, is simulated on a digital computer. The induction motor model is developed to permit a general solution when any number of the stator currents is zero. Using conduction criteria for individual SCRs, a new cycloconverter model is derived which results in an input/output transfer function."
"This paper describes a controlled-power-angle synchronous motor inverter system which provides drive characteristics similar to those of an induction motor inverter system. The system consists of a conventional synchronous motor with a shaft-position sensor which controls the firing of thyristors in an inverter. This paper investigates the steady-state properties and control strategies for the controlled-angle synchronous motor inverter system. Some experimental results are presented and compared with theoretical predictions."
"A new concept in power generation has been theoretically developed and experimentally tested at Oklahoma State University. The generator design incorporates new techniques in field modulation and solid-state alternator output processing. The resulting generator is smaller and lighter than comparable commercial models presently available, and it will operate such that frequency output is independent of the shaft speed of a prime mover."
"A new concurrent test method is described to verify the thyristor high-frequency capability and also describe a digital computer thyristor simulation program which accounts for the many variables of high-frequency applications. The thyristor model will be described in detail along with the method by which the model is aligned to the empirical concurrent test of the device. A sensitivity analysis will be presented to give the percent change in thyristor high-frequency capability due to changing other variables such as delay time of anode current, the RC dv/dt network and gate drive for standard (non-di/namic gage) devices."
"The structures, features, electrical characteristics, and successful application results of two types of high-voltage high-power reverse-conducting thyristors are described.

 "Both synchronous and induction motors driving fans, pumps, and compressors (variable torque types of loads) may prove to be more economical and reliable when utilizing a lower voltage motor plus a captive transformer rather than a 13.8-kV motor. The economic factors, matching motor capabilities to load requirements, power system considerations, relaying and grounding systems possibilities, and operating experience with installed drives in Atlantic Richfield's Philadelphia Refinery are covered."
"The electrical equipment and systems for a specific aluminum cold rolling mill for attaining rolling speeds in access of 8000 ft/min are described.

"Over the years, various approaches including both thermal magnetic breakers and several types of fusible devices have been used in motor circuit protection schemes with acceptable results. Evidence reported in the trade magazines indicated that the level of protection from these types of devices was not totally effective. For the first time, with the printing of the 1968 National Electric Code, the application of instantaneous trip circuit breakers (without time delay) was allowed provided the pickup could be adjusted above 700 percent to a maximum of 1300 percent of the motor full-load ampere rating. After extensive testing the first product complying with these requirements was introduced to the market in 1969. Experience in motor failures indicates that most faults occur at relatively low levels of fault current just above lock rotor values rather than at higher levels. With rapid clearing of faults in the low-level range such as can be accomplished with the use of instantaneous trip circuit breakers, extensive damage to motors as well as to control equipment can be greatly reduced. By combining low-level protection obtained with the high interrupting capabilities of specially designed current limiters, a full range of coordinated protection is available for both high-and low-level faults."
"During the past ten years the Army has invested a sizable effort into new systems configurations and development programs to improve ground vehicle mobility. United States Army Mobility Equipment Research and Development Center (USAMERDC), Fort Belvoir, Va., has been particularly interested in an improved vehicle mobility for off-highway vehicles, amphibians, and engineer equipment through electrical propulsion. Such drive systems incorporating individual wheel controls provide improved mobility over all types of terrain, simplified supply logistics, and permit a more functional vehicle design and construction. Past experience in industry and in the government has shown that the dc motor propulsion drive is inherently simple to install and to maintain. The dc motor is somewhat heavier than comparable ac motors due to motor speed limitations; however, the dc machine, particularly the series field motor, requires relatively simple power controls since the power is processed by the motor's own commutator. Commercial dc traction motors have an inherent high-torque starting characteristic which is mandatory for engineer-type vehicle propulsion applications. In the midspeed range however, presently available dc motor propulsion drives under consideration for the Anny have unsatisfactory acceleration performance when compared to conventional mechanical drive systems comprised of a spark or compression ignition engine and a multispeed transmission. In this context, the paper discusses this Center's experimental solid-state controller and the method employed to improve the acceleration or peak power propulsion profile of an electric vehicle drive using dc series field motors."
"In the chopper control system for electric railcars, it is effective to adopt high operational frequency of the chopper for achievement of the following: 1) decrease of higher harmonic current induced in the trolley wire, 2) reduction of weight for reactors and capacitors in the traction circuit, and 3) improvement of control response. Through development of reverse-conducting thyristors with very short turn-off time and a repulsion type two-phase chopper, we finally realized production of a new standard high-frequency chopper equipment with regenerative braking for 1500-V dc railcars. Technical achievements mentioned previously were completely realized as a result of adoption of high frequency, 660 Hz, in the equipment. The newly developed standard high-frequency chopper equipment for 30 cars were delivered to the Chiyoda Line of Teito Rapid Transit Authority in Tokyo, and they have been operated satisfactorily in revenue service since March 1971. This paper also describes: 1) the chopper circuit using fast-switching reverse-conducting thyristors and series saturable reactors, 2) analysis of commutation circuit and methods of suppressing reapplied forward voltage increasing rate (dv/dt) and shortening commutation period, 3) the composition of the traction circuit including the protection system, such as protection for overvoltage at the regenerative braking, and 4) test results on the Chiyoda Line of Teito Rapid Transit Authority."
"Chopper controlled electric rolling stock is maintenance free and can reduce power consumption considerably. Comfort and operating performance are both good. Because of these and other features, such rolling stock is now being widely used. However, there are several problems concerning this equipment, for example, harmonic current, its inductive interference, control system, etc. Therefore careful investigations are needed to solve these problems. This paper deals with the harmonic problems which occurs in chopper controlled electric rolling stock in the case of chopper normal or abnormal operation."
"This paper considers the theoretical problem of eliminating harmonics in inverter-output waveforms. Generalized methods are developed for eliminating a fixed number of harmonics in the half-bridge and full-bridge inverter-output waveforms, and solutions are presented for eliminating up to five harmonics. Numerical techniques are applied to solve the nonlinear equations of the problem on the computer. The uneliminated higher order harmonics can be easily attenuated by using filter circuits in the output stage of the inverter. The results show the feasibility of obtaining practically sinusoidal output waveforms, which are highly desirable in most inverter applications."
"A wide variety of power converters is of the transformer-coupled push-pull type and uses pulsewidth modulation for output regulation. In designing and operating such converters, serious complications usually arise as a result of unsymmetrical switching of the two power transistors. Caused by small parameter dissymmetries of these transistors, asymmetrical switching normally drives the transformer into saturation. Resulting excessive saturation currents reduce efficiency and put a severe strain on the power transistors, which can eventually cause circuit failure. This paper presents a new pulsewidth modulator circuit which can be advantageously utilized in the design of such converters, and which can effectively cope with the aforementioned symmetry problem. Symmetry correction is accomplished by monitoring the two primary currents and by providing proper feedback of the integrated difference between these two currents."
"The liquid pipeline control problems and methods to solve these problems are described. The advantages, disadvantages, and electrical differences of the solutions are discussed."
"A plating for electrical contact surfaces should be selected on the bases of acceptable electrical characteristics (in conjunction with common contact surfaces) and of adequate corrosion resistance in the anticipated environments. One of the problem electrical interfaces which must be considered is between the selected plating and nonplated aluminum contact surfaces."
"In considering voltage transients and sources the tendency is to consider the high-frequency low-energy domain primarily. There is evidence that indicates a significant incidence of transients in the frequency domain nearer the 60-Hz fundamental of the plant power supply. This paper explores some of the sources of these transients, their effects on various electrical equipment, and includes a limited empirical evaluation of their limits."
 "Since both the consideration of air pollution and concern for ecology have created a wider interest in cold electric melting as an available solution, some of the economic and technical factors affecting the selection and design of suitable furnaces are discussed with specific reference to larger tonnage requirements. Examples are cited and some conclusions are drawn."
"DDC means direct digital control of manufacturing variables at the lowest level process regulation, but DDC can ``talk'' to higher order systems and extend upwards in a computer hierarchy. DDC has been developed to a large degree by users and can be fitted to existing processes using standard available equipment and control concepts. No computer programming is necessary, reliability is higher than in some conventional systems, and maintenance is not difficult. Anyone now operating the plant can handle DDC. Costs can be lower than comparable function conventional controls, and there are only four major hardware components to a DDC system. The paper lists a number of real problems taken from the record which DDC has solved in existing successful installations. Methods for putting across a project and overcoming traditional management objections have been worked out."
"A quantitative mathematical analysis of coupled electrical power dissipation, heat transfer, and natural convection in a hypothetical all-electric glass tank furnace was conducted using a two-dimensional computer model. The model simulated numerically the complex interactions which occur among charge, mass, energy, and momentum transport in a vertical plane section through the melter. Computer generated contour plots of the power density, isotherms, and stream-lines in the rectangular enclosure are presented for both a flint glass and an amber glass, each with and without the variation of electrical resistivity with temperature taken into account. The total electrical power consumption was held constant in all cases investigated in order to establish a common basis for comparison of the results. It is shown that although the variation in melt resistivity, associated with the range of temperatures encountered in the interior of the hypothetical glass furnace, approaches 10 percent of the mean isothermal value, it has subsequently very little effect on the calculated temperature and velocity distribution within the enclosure over a wide range of effective thermal conductivities. Hence the electrical resistivity can be assumed consistent for all practical purposes when these are the results of primary interest. It is also shown that the electric melting behavior of colored glasses may be quite different from that of a flint glass under the same basic furnace operating conditions."
"Continuous process plants are being designed today with fewer and larger components arranged in ``single train'' configurations. Maintaining operating continuity with fewer components requires high equipment reliability. Motor controls for larger components are using magnetic contactors equipped with automatic undervoltage reclosing. A voltage dip where contactors drop open and reclose can be very serious because of the nature of motors and their driven loads during voltage transients. The reclosing of magnetic starters on motors with a decaying internal voltage is reviewed. A method of riding through voltage dips with dc coil magnetic contactors is described. Application of this method will depend upon the individual characteristics of each electrical system and the process that it serves."
"The benefits of digital computer control have been discussed in relation to chemical, petroleum, and many other industrial processes at great length on numerous occasions. When discussing the benefits and principles of computer control, the gas transmission pipeline reciprocating compressor station can also be considered a processing unit which, in a very complex manner using expensive machinery, converts raw feed (natural gas fuel) into product (energy in the natural gas in the form of increased pressure). This is particularly true since the introduction of the latest generation of reciprocating compressors with their new innovations."

 "Results have shown that the most practical approach to locating cable faults consists of a three-step procedure known as the System Approach. By this process various test instruments are employed to first characterize a fault according to its electrical parameters; to next localize the fault to an approximate location by measurements from a terminal; and then to finally locate the fault within that locality by physically tracing for its effect along the cable route. Success is measured in terms of the minimum of time to restore service which in turn is usually a function of the selection and performance of available instrumentation. All of the recognized methods and instruments that can be used in each step of the System Approach are described giving typical features along with the advantages and disadvantages of each method. This information should enable responsible engineers to evaluate the practicality of their own resources for the intended purpose."
"Bath circulation is an important and desirable feature of the coreless induction furnace. Existing theoretical models based on an infinite geometry provide little insight into the stirring problem. This paper describes practical experimental techniques used to measure current density distributions in solid conducting cylinders. Experimental results are presented for a wide range of induction melting situations and are used to explain the dependence of circulation and meniscus formation on power density, frequency, and force distribution in the metal. Changes in current density and force distribution due to the relative position of the charge with respect to the furnace coil axe examined. The results are extended to large furnaces by means of simple mathematical formulas."
"Telemetry technique and presently available equipment may be utilized to optimize information retrieval speed and to minimize the total cost of information. An example of equipment is presented with basic theory of operation. Specific applications are discussed in the areas of pressure, temperature, and strain measurement. Technique is reviewed in terms of antenna placement and heat shielding of the telemetry package. By use of the systems approach to information retrieval, telemetry technique can be of value to the glass industry where other methods of measurement are not optimum or applicable."
"The criterion of no ignition is stated in general. The relation between the electrical power output and the discharge voltage, and the power output and time are discussed for resistive circuits with source voltages ranging from 24-60 V, tested by the German breakflash. Shadow photographs of the electrode area with the incipient kernel and the relevant oscillograms of the discharge voltage are recorded. From the oscillograms a general discharge voltage pattern emerges. The theoretical considerations as well as the experimental results suggest that the critical section when ignition is likely to occur under minimum igniting conditions coincides with the peak of the power transfer function. Suggestions are made about the practical application of these results to monitor the sensitivity of the breakflash or forecast the probable value of minimum igniting current or power for a given circuit."
"A digital computer program written by Westinghouse engineers aids the design of new static logic systems for metal mills. The computer program accepts logic equations specifying the functions to be performed. The program generates circuit drawings of logic circuitry plus paper tape for controlling an automatic wiring machine. The automatic wiring machine wires the back panel receptacles for plug-in cards which contain the integrated-circuit AND/NAND logic elements. The design engineer determines functional requirements to be performed by the logic circuits. He expresses these requirements in convenient logic statement form and adds comments on circuit functioning. Logic and comment statements are keypunched for input to the computer. The computer analyzes the equations, converts the functions to AND/ NAND logic circuits and generates the punched-paper tape required by the automatic wiring machine. In addition, the computer generates the circuit diagrams showing the actual AND/NAND circuits with complete (JIC) cross references and comments on circuit functioning. During computer processing diagnostic messages are generated to aid in finding design errors. Only one type of logic board is used in the new static logic system to perform all logic functions. This reduces maintenance to mere board replacement and greatly reduces spare board inventory. Triac outputs are featured in addition to normal contact closure outputs. Traic is a static ac switch which can operate pilot-operated solenoid valves, contactors, indicating lights, and other common ac loads. The logic system combines the advantages of fully wired integrated-circuit logic with the convenience and accuracy of computer aided design."
"Increasing demands for energy from the petroleum industry with added ecological protection presents one of the greatest challenges of the 1970's. This situation demands high production efficiency and consolidated operations. To meet these objectives, extensive automation and data information systems are needed. In perspective, these become part of telecommunication systems-a new function in producing operations."
"A new rectifier connection scheme which eliminates line-to-line short circuits and tends to present a balanced load to three-phase power sources, such as synchronous machines with high commutating reactances, is presented. The scheme consists of using three full-wave bridges, one across each of the three isolated phase windings, with their outputs tied in parallel across the load. Resulting voltage and current waveforms have been studied in detail theoretically and verified experimentally for both resistive and inductive load conditions. Equations for voltages and currents and theoretical plots for voltages under different operating conditions are given. Comparison of these with oscillograms obtained from an experimental model shows very close agreement."
"The load waveforms produced by asymmetrical triggering of an inverse parallel connected pair of thyristors are of two categories. If each of the two firing angles α,β are greater than load phase angle ϕ, the load curtent consists of asymmetrical discontinuous nonsinusoidal pulses. For the case when firing angle ϕ is less than ϕ and satisfies the relationship β ⪕ 𝒳α. - π (where 𝒳α is the extinction angle corresponding to the other firing angle α), complete half-sinusoids of load voltage appear. Both modes of triggering result in load waveforms with even harmonic content, which are not present with symmetrical triggering."
"This paper presents a triac converter which can replace two thyristor bridges normally used for regenerative dc motor drives. The most important characteristics of the triac are outlined and specific problems are discussed. Performance specifications for the control electronics are given. An experimental drive is presented and some run measurements are shown."
"The dc output of low-voltage diode rectifiers can be adjusted economically and efficiently by thyristor ac power controllers on the ac side of the rectifier transformer. This method of obtaining voltage control has been used for a number of years. This paper presents an analysis of the various modes of operation, the waveforms, control characteristics, and various other parameters and observations of interest for some commonly employed circuits. In particular the sixpulse bridge rectifier with delta-wye transformer (ASA-23) and the six-pulse double-wye interphase rectifier with delta-double wye transformer (ASA-45) have been studied theoretically as well as experimentally. Attention has been given to the problem of transformer saturation, and the associated requirements for gating accuracy was found to be less stringent than one would expect. It was further discovered that these circuits have some pronounced advantages over the corresponding six-pulse phase controlled converters when comparing dc ripple and reactive power consumption from the line."
"Power output of a resistive electrical heater is a function of resistance value. The authors describe a radiation cross-linked heater which undergoes dramatic resistance changes with temperature. Self- limiting features and some applications are discussed with special emphasis given to the self-limiting feature as applied to electrical pipe line heating."
"It is estimated that over two million feet of electrical heater was installed in 1971 on process piping in areas with a National Electrical Code Classification of Class I Group D Division 2. Therefore, the designer of electrical heat tracing systems must develop a thorough knowledge of those products and design practices which give the greatest assurance of safety and reliability."
"A new type of self-commutated inverter for fixed or moderately variable frequency has been developed. The inverter is characterized by an extremely uncomplicated main circuit. In its basic form the inverter contains two converter circuits: a principal converter circuit and an auxiliary converter circuit. The principal converter circuit transfers power from the input dc side to the output ac side, and the auxiliary converter circuit generates an inductive current to balance the reactive current of a three-phase capacitor on the ac side. This capacitor has the combined function of a phase compensator, a filter capacitor, and is also the source of the commutating voltage. Both converter circuits are of the line commutated type, meaning that at power frequencies normal converter thyristors can be employed. This makes it possible to build high-power inverters without series or parallel connected thyristors. All filter reactors are smoothing reactors placed on the dc side of the converter circuits. Thus the inverter has a very good efficiency even at the higher frequencies. The ability of a converter circuit to generate a negative sequence current when unsymmetrically controlled makes the inverter insensitive to unbalanced loads. The transient behavior of the inverter is similar to that obtained from a conventional self-commutated inverter with an output filter."
"After a short explanation of the need to develop a new power transmission system, listing the general demands on the performance of a locomotive, the arrangement of an existing diesel electric locomotive, the DE 2500, is presented. The main components of the system, such as the alternator, converter, traction motors, and the whole control system are described in detail. Consideration is given to the interaction between the different components which had to be taken care of in the design. Good operating experience has shown that the system was well chosen. For the future a uniform drive scheme for different power supplies appears realizable."

 "The increased concern for human safety is one of several factors which makes the National Electrical Code increasingly important to engineers involved in plant electrical systems. New requirements are extending into areas not previously covered by the Code. This paper discusses some selected major changes which are of most interest to industries using large amounts of power, and some changes which are apt to be controversial. Included are: ground-fault protection, service entrance arrangements, autotransformers, transformer primary and secondary protection, separately-derived systems, and new product possibilities."
"Assuming the availability of a high energy and power density battery of 100 Wh/lb and 100 W/lb by the 1980' s, the energy consumption and efficiency of electric and heat engine cars are compared on an equal basis. This is achieved by considering a reference electric car of 3150-lb weight similar in body construction, aerodynamics, and rolling resistance to a conventional heat engine car of equal weight, and comparing the performance of the two cars over the same driving modes. The reference electric car is then used as a baseline to evaluate the possible improvements in future electric cars. The energy consumption for an optimized 2000-lb electric car of driving range, comfort, and performance comparable to a conventional car is estimated. Assuming a gradual growth in electric car population leading to their widespread use by the 1990's, the impact on electric power generation and distribution systems is estimated. Though the analysis is based on a high energy and power density battery the results may be extrapolated to electric cars using lower performance batteries. It is noted that batteries with lower energy density can provide sufficient driving range to fulfill a significant portion of our transportation needs and their continued development and improvement will accelerate the achievement of the high energy-density goal [1]."
"Interest in high-amplitude short-time voltage transients has increased with the introduction of solid-state equipment into the electrical system. The paper presents and discusses some of the causes of short-time voltage transients, the special instrumentation developed to measure these phenomena, and the results of preliminary measurements made aboard a number of naval ships."
"Design of luminaires and lighting systems traditionally has been made in accordance with the criterion of providing adequate levels of ilumination. The problem of overcoming ``veiling reflection'' effects, which cause great losses of visibility, largely has been overlooked. This has resulted in the ``visual performance'' of persons engaged in tasks such as reading and writing seriously being impaired. This paper describes the cause and evaluation of veiling reflections and shows how lighting equipment can be designed to overcome the deleterious effects, without sacrificing other requirements of the system."
"A discussion of end devices, and their application to supervisory control systems is presented. The author describes a hypothetical supervisory control application, and discusses system application techniques. Technical merits and/or liabilities associated with each application technique are discussed in conjunction with the associated economics. The paper not only discusses supervisory control systems, but end devices, man/machine interfaces, communication networks, and lightning protection. The paper concludes with the author's impression of what the end user can anticipate from manufacturers of supervisory control systems, end devices, and communication equipment."
"The induction slab heating installation at the new United States Mint in Philadelphia including a description of the unusual wide rectangular coil approach to induction heating, coil construction, phase balancer power circuit, and physical arrangement is described."
"In the modern hot strip mill, the loopers establish a low and relatively constant level of tension between stands. This aids in minimizing width deviation, and provides an isolated environment for the operation of automatic gage control equipment at each stand. The looper also serves to keep all stands of a mill in synchronism during speedup and slowdown when metal is in the mill. The flexibility of control which is inherent in adjustable-voltage looper systems permits the incorporation of a number of features which contribute to the effectiveness of the drive. Static and dynamic characteristics of electric hot strip mill looper systems are reviewed."
"This paper describes methods of calculating the peak temperature rise of the armature winding of a dc servo motor when operated on a specific duty cycle and for torque values greater than rated. It also defines the relationship of the maximum allowable time ON (tR) for a desired output torque such that the peak temperature rise will not exceed the temperature rating of the insulation thus ensuring adequate insulation life. A new approach of specifying these duty cycle characteristics is suggested which can be used to find the maximum time ON (tR) for a given torque as well as the peak temperature rise for any length of time ON (t1). The use of these characteristics can be extended from repetitive cycles to duty cycles where output torque requirements within a cycle are varying. This analytical approach is supported by experimental data."
"The susceptibility of electrical systems to electromagnetic disturbances is mostly specified in the frequency domain. Similarly, the efficiency of suppression techniques, such as filtering and shielding, is also presently specified in the frequency domain. As an appreciable part of the malfunctions (destructive and nondestructive) in control systems is caused by nonrepetitive transient type of electromagnetic disturbances, it is proposed that the susceptibility slhould additionally be specified in the time domain. This is particularly true for control systems containing semiconductor devices, because these devices operate on the principle of minimum clharge injection. Although a transient in the time domain can be mathematically converted into the frequency domain for the purpose of analysis, this procedure does not correspond to the physical situation and therefore does not give the true susceptibility of the system. Finally, several criteria are proposed for specifying the susceptibility of control systems to electromagnetic disturbances."
"Each piece of equipment in an electrical system is a potential source of transient voltages. At the same time, it also has some degree of susceptibility to transient voltages. This paper discusses the allowable limits of transient voltages generated by each piece of equipment and the total system, and the susceptibility of each piece of equipment and the system. For satisfactory operation of a system, the allowable limits of the generated transient voltages should be coordinated with the specified susceptibility of each piece of equipment as well as the system. The coordinated protection of an electrical system is the joint responsibility of the equipment designer and the systems engineer. Techniques to measure susceptibility are also described."
"The behavior of ten types of silicon rectifiers under transient voltages was studied experimentally. The steady-state peak reverse voltage (PRV) ratings of these rectifiers were from 300-1200 V, and the half-cycle average current ratings were from 25-300 A. The study shows that, at least for the samples tested, the transient-voltage withstand capability of a silicon rectifier does not have any correlation with its PRV rating. A silicon rectifier may be damaged by a transient voltage lower than its PRV rating while it is carrying current in the forward direction. The transient-voltage withstand capability can also be widely divergent for different types of rectifiers of the same PRV rating. It is proposed that the transient-voltage withstand capability of each type of silicon rectifier should be specified along with its steady-state PRV rating."
"Several design features incorporated into a line of pulse-width modulated inverter drives are described. They include voltage and current protective circuits that provide SCR protection without fuses. A modified McMurray communication circuit is covered. Design considerations for high-voltage (460 V) inverters and paralleling of inverters are discussed. Finally, a modular packaging system providing good maintainability is described."
"In connection with the ever increasing applications of static inverters in the area of uninterruptable power systems and variable frequency ac motor drives, and the many forced-commutated inverter circuits that are proposed for these applications, an endeavor has been made to classify the impulse-commutated inverter circuits and to compare their characteristic features with each other. To attain this, the basic commutation circuits were considered generally, but yet varied enough to make some conclusions. Although there are but a few basic ways to insert a commutation impulse source in the forced-commutated inverter, many variations are possible, which make the design of inverters a difficult matter and very dependent on the desired specifications and the available components."
"A new three-phase ac to ac static frequency changer is described. It accepts power from a conventional three-phase constant frequency (e.g., 60 Hz) source, and control signals from an auxiliary circuit, also three phase. The converter output may be represented by positive, negative, and zero sequence voltage systems, each system characterized by a particular frequency. By appropriate control, the lowest (fundamental) output frequency becomes fc -fs Hz, where fc is continuously controlled and fs is the constant supply frequency. Fundamental output frequency is associated with positive and zero sequence voltages. The process of conversion involves both free and forced commutation. It may be accomplished by four thyristors per phase, triggered by the square-wave control signals."
"Based on tests in laboratories and on German Federal Railways (GFR) trial vehicles type ET 25 as well as on an industrial locomotive type 500 of the Rheinische Braunkohlen AG the subsequent development has been concentrated on the improvement of the power factor λ and the displacement factor cosϕ in four vital stages: 1) introduction of half-control, unsymmetrical half-controlled, fully-controlled single-phase bridge connection with specially designed control systems: 2) introduction of sequence connection of several half-controlled bridges; 3) optimization of the so far applied connections for major assemblies such as rectifier transformer, rectifier, and smoothing reactor for improving the power factor; 4) introduction of sector control with self-commutating unsymmetrical bridge for improving the power factor."

  "This paper presents a new theory of the end-effect of a high-speed linear induction motor, an experimental proof of the theory, and several countermeasures to eliminate the end-effect. The theory is developed on the basis of a two-dimensional solution of electrodynamic equations and compared with the experimental results. The experiment has been made by use of a rotary type test facility; the maximum test velocity is 450 km/h. It is found that the theory agrees well with the experiment and that the end-effect exercises a very adverse influence on motor performance. The end-effect is investigated as functions of design parameters by making use of the theory. Some measures to counter the end-effect are proposed and discussed. A parallel-connected linear induction motor is also proposed as a measure to compensate the end-effect, and its performance is studied."
"The paper describes a special combination of high resolution, high accuracy, solid-state radar equipment with a sophisticated computer operated automatic acquisition automatic plot collision avoidance indicator. Technical characteristics and special features that make this equipment particularly suitable for the newer higher speed Merchant Marine vessels are described. A description is given of the separate displaying of high resolution radar and automatic navigational data. Information is also presented concerning application and performance features that make it particularly well suited for service aboard ships."
"This paper covers the selection and layout of the electrical equipment and factors governing the choices made for the Alcan Aluminum Corporation 8000 ft/min 4-high cold reducing mill located at Oswego, N.Y. Many of the new features of the mill are outlined, and an evaluation is made of their effectiveness in operation. Operating experiences and operator training are also described."
"Today, the slab mill operator cannot do it alone. He needs the help that process control provides. When process control is mentioned, many people immediately think of a computer. But a computer is only one example of process control. A control that takes a number of actions performed by mill operators and simplifies them, or relieves an operator of continual attentiveness to the process may be considered process automation. This paper will describe process automation, or control, as it is applied to the various drives in the slab mill, indicated on Fig 1. The slab mill area includes the ingot buggy, main mill, scarfer, shear, weigh and stamp, and piler. The rolling mill itself will be described last since major emphasis will be placed on process control for this area."
"This paper gives the results of a survey conducted by the Power Distribution System Subcommittee of the Pulp and Paper Industry Committee of the IEEE Industry Applications Society. Its purpose was twofold, 1) to explore utility/mill relaying and electrical tie practices and, 2) to explore and devise safe and expeditious operation practices in reenergizing a circuit after a primary or medium voltage feeder breaker tripout has occurred."
"Rising costs of manufacturing and construction have led to the development of modern distribution systems having higher kVA ratings with larger available fault currents. Because of this, it is essential that special considerations be given to methods that will reduce the available fault current at the motor-control-center incoming terminals to a value that is within the rating of the motor control center."
"It has long been recognized that third harmonic currents can and often do appear in the neutral of industrial generators. This paper will review the causes of such currents and the effects these currents have in the power system. The common methods of neutral grounding will be discussed with regard to circulating harmonic currents."
"One of the prime functions of equipment grounding is for safety to life and property. In designing an industrial power system that obtains any energy from a utility with a high ground fault current capability, it may be advisable to isolate the industrial and utility ground grids for safety reasons. A review of present practices as well as suggested modifications with an actual design example is presented."
"Solid-state control has rapidly replaced conventional electromechanical devices and vacuum tube electronics in its first decade of industrial usage. The growth of solid-state applications has been evolutionary and based on a practical approach to utilizing the optimum available solution, both economically and technologically, to achieve improved control system reliability and performance. The application of solid-state electronic devices is discussed from the input of the operator's commands through a typical industrial control system to the power conversion equipment that supplies the drive motor. Frequency of failures in solid-state devices is so low that maintenance men do not retain familiarity with circuits and device theory. This has necessitated the need for low-level maintainability through the use of functional plug-in printed circuit cards, full-time instrumentation, light-emitting diode logic status indicators, and system engineered diagnostic test circuits built into the system. The future looks promising for further technological developments in solid-state devices. A continued growth in solid-state industrial drive systems is assured with expected trends toward further development of adjustable frequency power conversion systems, and hybrid logic/control systems."
"With the advent of steel wire as a cord material used in the construction of steel radial tires as a product improvement replacement for previously utilized materials such as fiberglass, polyester, nylon, and rayon, greater tensions are required to be maintained on the wire prior to entry into the calender. This higher tension and the inherent handling characteristics of wire necessitates more precision and subsequently more sophisticated methods of tension control for wire-strand let-offs in the manufacturing process. Various devices are discussed together with related tension sensing and control techniques used to handle up to 1600 strands of wire, which form a single wire sheet, before entering the calender nip rolls."
"Constant-torque adjustable-speed phase-controlled SCR dc drives are compared with inverter drives from the standpoint of technical similarities and differences, application limitations, and relative costs. Various inverter types are discussed and compared. Finally, guidelines as to the factors influencing the ac versus dc decision are summarized and tabulated."
"Since the prime goal of the mine laws and the concern of the inspectors will be safety to personnel, safe practices will be required with guidance from coal mining experiences, as well as mandatory regulations from metal and nonmetallic mine safety laws."
"The heart of the cement plant is the rotary kiln, and continuous quality production of cement clinker depends on the continuous accurate performance of the rotary kiln drive."
"Ball-mill noise became a matter of general concern with passage of the Walsh-Healy Act in 1969. This act is now a part of the broader safety act known as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Noise is one of the ``newest pollutants'' in terms of the definition set forth in the Walsh-Healy Act. Studies are currently underway to establish standards by which to determine conformity with, or violation of, the act."
"The operation of a three-phase ring inverter with resistive and reactive loads has been analyzed here directly in time domain. The initial conditions on all the six condensers have been taken into account. The instantaneous output voltage and the harmonic content of the output have been obtained. In an earlier paper the author has presented a frequency domain analysis of such an inverter. The general method of writing circuit equations in frequency domain as well as directly in time domain presented in these two papers can in fact be applied to the study of the recurrent transients of many complex switching circuits. Experimental results reported in the earlier paper by the same authors are also presented here for comparison with the predicted results."
"A method of analysis of induction motor performance with nonsinusoidal supply is presented. It is based on the Fourier analysis of the impressed voltage waveform. Equivalent circuits for the various harmonics are derived, and the resultant harmonic currents are calculated. Experimental verification of the method is obtained by calculating the current waveform from the Fourier components and comparing it with oscillograms. Experimental data obtained from a cycloconverter and different types of inverters are used and show good agreement with calculated results. Evaluation of different schemes of power control and effects of a rapid variation of slip frequency are examined."

"Summary form only given, as follows. The IEEE Reliability Physics Symposium Award for Outstanding Contributions to the field of Reliability Physics was authorized by vote of the Syrriposium Board of Directors. This award, which is not necessarily given annually, is to be presented to individuals who, by their work, have made major significant contributions to the advancement of the field of reliability. The 1973 Award was presented to Joseph Vaccaro of the Rome Air Development Center, US Air Force, in recognition of his pioneering efforts in the field of Reliability Physics-for his early recognition of the need for a fresh approach to semiconductor device reliability, based upon an understanding of the physical and chemical basis for device degradation and failure: for his unflagging dedication and continued participation in this series of Symposia, starting with his presentation of the first technical paper at the initial meeting in 1962, and for his establishment of the first extensive US Department of Defense (DoD) failure analysis laboratory for semiconductor devices, which has set the pattern for those which followed, both here and abroad."

 "This is a study of bonding methods used in electronic component fabrication. One result is the formation of dynamic intermediate alloys that exhibit continual change toward an ultimate equilibrium condition. Microstructural changes are influenced by time, temperature, matrix materials, alloying elements, impurities and contaminants. The limiting strength of the bond is determined to a major extent by the conditions existent at the leading edge of the intermetallic layer as it grows into the host matrix. Characteristic growth patterns may provide the insight to a better understanding of this bonding mechanism."
"The rates at which Au, Ag, Cu, and Ni wires dissolved in 95wt%Pb-5%Sn and 92.5wt% Pb-5%In-2.57%Ag soft solders were measured between 360 and 500°C. The rates have an Arrhenius behavior with temperature and for both solders nickel has the lowest dissolution rate while gold has the highest. A model is discussed, using the analysis of Lommel and Chalmers, which allows prediction of relative dissolution rates into Pb-Sn solders with any composition. Small amounts of Au and Ag, purposely added to 95wt%Pb-5%Sn die bonds in test power transistors, were found to deleteriously affect the fatigue resistance of the solder as measured during power cycling. Analysis of fracture surfaces and cross sections indicated that most of the gold forms tin intermetallics at the die-solder interface while the silver dissolved into the molten solder."
"Thermocompression bondability in the tantalum nitride-chromium-goald metallization system is degraded because of diffusion and oxidation of chromiium resulting from a 300°C 2-hour air bake used to stabilize the tantalum nitride resistor network. Bondability can be restored by chemically removing the contaminant with either a gold etch treatment using potassium iodide and iodine or a chromium oxide etch treatment using ceric ammonium nitrate before thermocompression bonding. The integrity of bonds made to restored films is not degraded in tests at temperatures between -50° and 350°C for up to 200 hours. Delamination at the gold-chromium interface ciould not be induced by extended etching in ceric ammonium nitrate for as long as 96 hours."
"Discoloration of electrodeposited gold on TO-5 headers after a 500°C bake has been evaluated by measuring reflected light. This method, in conjunction with ultrasonic bonding and a destructive wire pull test, has been used to establish parts bond- ability. Correlation has been found between the variation in reflectivity and bond pull strength."
"The mechanical properties of thin film aluminum metallization have been determined by applying a biaxial tension stress to the films. The mechanical properties were found to-vary as a function of deposition conditions. No correlation was found between the mechanical properties of the metallization and thermocompression wire bonding; however, a linear relationship was found between yield strength of the metallization and the temperature change required to cause surface reconstruction during cyclic operation."
"Dual-in-line plastic packages (DIPs) from several different suppliers have been found to have open or intermittent open leads after routine thermal cycling tests. The failure mode has been duplicatated in the laboratory by placing gold bonding wires under tensile stress at different temperatures for varying times. Confirtuation of the tensile failure mode has led to the conclusion that to avoid tensile. failures, the plastic and the molding process used for DIPs must be such that the wire is kept under compressive stress over the entire working temperature range of the circuit."
"The predominant failure mode experienced in solid tantalum capacitors is the electrical short caused by impurities in the tantalum slugs and imperfections in the dielectric. These defects result in a phenomenon commonly called scintillation, the momentary short at dielectric imperfections. Scintillations can result in the capacitor (1) healing itself, (2) forming high leakage current, or (3) permanently shorting. The lack of understanding and the random nature of these scintillations have caused users to incorporate extreme application derating, experience higher system costs, incur long purchasing lead times, and specify physically larger components. Characterization of the failure modes and mechanisms resulted in deeper understanding of the physics of the component. By establishing an effective closed-loop failure analysis system, the failure modes and mechanisms were examined, applications were studied, and corrective actions developed and implemented. This paper demonstrates that by correctly applied screening methods, pre-failure and post-failure analyses, and voltage and temperature derating (without an extra derating for < 3 ohms/volt applications) the solid tantalum capacitor can be made to demonstrate extremely low failure rates in a variety of applications. Data presented fit a Weibull distribution with a decreasing failure rate, and establish a curve which can be used as a small lot reliability indicator."
"A unique open-circuit failure mode was observed in thin-film discrete chip resistors used in hybrid microelectronic devices. Their Nichrome resistance element is deposited over silicon dioxide (SiO2) on a silicon chip (30 by 30 mils) (0. 769 mm square). Termination pads of aluminum are provided to facilitate wire bonding. To enhance contact, a layer of titanium is interposed between the Nichroome and the aluminum. The resistor failures are caused by two factors: (1) excessive thickness of the Nichrome element, (2) use of excessively high processing temperatures to oxidize the Nichrome to the proper sheet resistance during wafer processing, which results in excessive alloying of the titanium and Nichrome materials. The latter produces an oxidized stress-sensitive interface between the Nichrome and titanium and results in time- and stress-dependent failures. Evidence of excessive reprocessing of the silicon wafers was also found, which may be a good indicator that the supplier was having process-control difficulties. Processes contributing to this failure mode and the controls that have been imposed to prevent recurrence are described."
"The reliability of thin-film Ni-Cr resistors was studied with respect to the effects of corrosion, oxidation and interdiffusion. Water on unpassivated films resulted in anodic dissolution at potentials above 2.5 volts. Oxidation increased the resistivity and lowered the T.C.R. to 20 ppm/°C. Aluminum diffused into the NiCr with an activation energy of 96 kcal/mole."
"Environmental testing designed to cull out components which do not conform to typical performance parameters is a time consuming and often destructive method of reliability screening. It does not indicate the component's normal operational performacne and it cannot be used in incoming inspection or production monitoring. A nominally linear component, however, can be easily checked for its degree of non-linearity by selective measurement of the third harmonic voltage generated in the component when a pure sinusoidal current is applied. This measurement is capable of detecting abnormal conditions in resistors due to faulty welds, film aberrations, resis, tive path inconsistencies, contact instability, and other imperfections that may cause shifts in resistance value. It therefore can identify resistors that have a potential for excess parametric change even though they may never fail in actual operation. The third harmonic voltage is measured by exciting the component under test with a very pure sinusoidal current of 10 Khz frequency and measuring the 30 Khz voltage generated within the component. This requires a specially designed air coil transformer for impedance matching, and associated circuitry which guarantees 150 db suppression of the fundamental signal for minimum residual distortion and optimum instrument sensitivity. Various defects intentionally produced in Bulk Metal Film resistors have been subsequently screened by both the component linearity test and by standard repetitive short time overload tests. Units screened by both methods were subjected to environmental stresses."
"Reflow-Soldering technology provides a low lost, high yield interconnection scheme for packaging monolithic integerated circuits. This paper gives the reliability data on such a package, test procedures used, and discusses some of the factors which influence the reliability of the package."
"Defective wire bonds account for a high percentage of hybrid-microcircuit failures. The work reported here was undertaken to evaluate methods of determining and enhancing bond reliability. The investigations indicated the limitations of visual inspection and such conventional screening techniques as mechanical shock and acceleration testing and thermal cycling for the assessment of microcircuit bonds. They showed that pull-strength testing and failure-mode identification constitute a valuable tool for use in reliability evaluation and manufacturing control."
"Evaluation of the reliability of thin film conductors and crossovers is essential for the determination of the life expectancy of circuits containing these elements operating under various conditions in the telephone plant. In the present study thin film conductor and crossover test circuits were encapsulated with RTV 3145 and exposed to dry temperature cycling and temperature cycling in a high humidity environment. The encapsulant effectively prevented corrosion and the crossover structures were not damaged by the mechanical stresses caused by the differential in thermal expansion coefficients of gold and RTV. The main failure mode was found to be the increase in leakage current through the encapsulant of the crossovers with a strong dependence on the thickness of the encapsulant and the applied bias voltage. It was concluded that the crossover and conductor life will be adequate for almost all applications, even under the most stringent environment conditions."
"I assume that we all agree that a component does not become inherently less reliable when combined with other components, as in a hybrid, than it is singly. To think otherwise would be unscientific and perhaps even unAmerican. A component that has a particular failure rate when individually packaged should not have a higher failure rate in a hybrid assembly all things being equal. Unfortunately, not all things remain equal and perhaps that is the substance of the question before the panel."
   "Typical semiconductor users do not perform failure analysis on what they feel are package hermeticity problems. They usually draw their conclusions from standard fine and gross tests which may be inaccurate. The following discussion portrays methods of verifying hermeticity integrity."
"Failure analysis of wire bonds has an important part to play in determining the causes of microelectronic device failure and ways for making and using devices to achieve greater reliability. Several tests and procedures used in the failure analysis of wire bonds are reviewed. Some of the inferences. about possible causes of permanent or intermittent failure that can be drawn from such tests, particularly those involving inspection with an optical microscope and with a scanning electron microscope, are discussed. Some attention is paid to the effects on the reliability of the wire bond of the growth of gold-aluminum intermetallic compounds, of Kirkendall voids, and of the use of poor materials, poor processes in making the wire bond, and poor control over the processes used. Also reviewed are some metallurgical sectioning techniques and a variety of methods used in opening the commonly used packages and in exposing wire bonds that are encapsulated in epoxy, phenolic resin, or silicone materials."
"Electrical overstress microcircuit failures are a major cause of equipment malfunction. Visual cues for bidentifying overstress failures are discussed. In addition means for determining the current, voltage and pulse width magnitudes of the transient pulse which caused the failure are explained."
"There have been many good papers presented on various failure analysis techniques for studying oxide defects. This paper will review some of these and will describe, in detail, the application of nematic liquid crystals to the problem of locating pinholes in oxide layers. Methods of isolating the defective area will also be covered. Some problems caused by the use off deposited oxide scratch coating and a method of removing these coatings without removing the underlying metalization are also discussed."
"This paper is intended to give some guidance for a workshop session on surface inversion. It first highlights the key causes of surface inversion, such as electronic and ionic charges, surface and bulk contamination, and leakage mechanisms. Second, the paper describes a number of widely used failure analysis techniques which permit the study of surface inversion and accumulation in MOS and bipolar devices and circuits. These techniques include the evaluation of test structure data, as gained by capacitor and field plate arrangements at variable temperatures, and the analysis of actual circuits using the scanning electron microscope, the photoresponse scanner, the microprobe, and electrical characterization. As examples for surface inversion, temperature-voltage inversion, surface and bulk generated currents, and lateral charge spreading are described. Some final comments lead to the more encompassing subject of device parameter stability improvement by process control."
 "With the rapid evolution of the functional complexity of MOS/LSI circuits, the task of detailed failure analysis has become increasingly complex. The failure analysis diagnostic techniques and laboratory procedures developed for the analysis of MOS/LSI circuits will be discussed and illustrated. These analysis techniques, emphasizing the use of computerized test equipment, were found to reduce significantly the laboratory cycle time and increase the level of understanding of MOS/LSI failure mechanisms."
"A High Temperature-Operating Life Test was performed on a Hybrid Integrated Circuit Analog Switch to determine Its reliability. All failures resulting from the Life Test were analyzed to determine the cause of failure. Surface defect and intermetalic failure mechanisms were observed. The High Temperature test results were used to estimate the operational life capability of the Hybrid device. Utilizing the log-normal distribution, the Arrhenius relationship and the technique set forth by Bell Telephone Labs, an estimated component failure rate of 2.6 × 10-3 percent per 1,000 hours was calculated."
"A noncontact procedure for sensing continuity and isolation faults in large, dense interconnection patterns by means of selective deposition of charge by an electron beam is Proposed and discussed. When the accelerating potential is properly chosen, a marked variation in the secondary electron signal occurs during the charging of an electrically floating element to an equilibrium potential. This phenomenon forms the basis of the method. A laboratory system has been constructed to demonstrate the procedure. Results obtained indicate agreement with the basic theory and demonstrate the application of the technique to continuity and isolation testing of conductor films and failure analysis of encapsulated circuits. Electron beam testing has a clear advantage over mechanical probe testing in terms of speed and flexibility. The less attractive features include the need for a vacuum system and the inability to detect continuity faults when the fault resistance is less than about one megohm."
 "The study of the transient flat-band shifts during the drift of sodium ions from the metal to the silicon interface in (HCl) MOS structures revealed that the rate limiting process in the neutralization of positively charged ions is the charge exchange between the ions and the silicon electrode; therefore, the magnitude and duration of the temporary flat-band shifts depend upon the rate of emission of ions from the metal interface as well as upon the rate of the charge exchange. Assuming that the rate of charge exchange is proportional to the instantaneous number of non-neutralized ions, their \"lifetime\" can be determined experimentally. This has been found to be approximately 4 seconds at 120°C and exhibits an activation energy of 0.8 eV. Although the measurements have been carried out only down to 75°C, it has been definitely established that the neutralization mechanism is operative at temperatures as low as room temperature. Based upon the lifetime data and on the emission characteristics of ions from the metal interface, estimates can be arrived at for the appropriate conditions of temperaturebias aging of MOS devices to avoid the appearance of instabilities during actual operation."
"The threshold voltage stability of p- and n-channel silicon gate FETs is improved by annealing the gate silicon nitride in oxygen or steam prior to deposition of the silicon gate. Annealing shifts the threshold voltage negatively by 100-200mV, and lowers the normalized transconductance slightly. Field effect mobility, fast surface state density and junction leakage are not affected by the anneal. Formation of a thin layer of SiO2 plus SiOXNy during annealing increases nitride resistivity and reduces the threshold voltage shift due to charge storage at the oxide-nitride interface."
"Electrons can flow from the field plate of a silicon gate MOS, through the gate oxide, to the contacts or the channel, if the field plate is brought into avalanche. This leads to shifts in the transistor threshold voltage, and premature discharge of floating nodes. The characteristics of p-type polycrystalline silicon films in MOS avalanche have been examined. Avalanche injected electron currents in the gate oxide up to 1 mA/cm2 have been measured at 500 KHz. Trapping of electrons occurs at a distance of 100 Å from the oxide interface, and appears to depend strongly on the boron content of the gate oxide."
  "The basic operation, advantages, and limitations of the scanning electron microscope are discussed. In applications the high magnification and large depth of field capabilities of the SEM are shown to aid in evaluating surface features such as metallization and wire bonds. Examples of both dynamic and static voltage contrast displays illustrate the localization of defects in integrated circuits. The electron beam induced current mode is used to detect sub-surface defects in discrete devices."
"The basic operation, advantages, and limitations of the Auger electron spectroscopy technique are discussed. Applications include simultaneous surface analysis and ion sputtering to produce a compositional-depth profile. This technique is used to study the soldering problem caused by diffusion of impurities to the surface during high temperature treatments. In analyzing wire bond problems, the elemental and chemical bonding information of the Auger signals is shown to provide identification of processing defects."
"The electron microprobe is an extremely useful diagnostic tool. It is capable of performing both qualitative and quantitative analysis, and may also provide information on chemical valence state. The analyses are rapid and nondestructive, and may be obtained on an extremely local scale, typically 1-2 cubic microns."
"The ion microprobe is a relatively new analytical tool, which has by far the greatest sensitivity, and perhaps even a greater potential as a diagnostic tool for failure analysis, than the previous techniques described. Whereas detection limits are typically 1018 atom/cc for the EMP, detection limits for the ion microprobe may be as low as 1013 atom/cc. It may be used to analyze a sample in depth and can do point analysis in regions almost as small as the EMP."
 "A rapid process control stress test is described, for use in evaluating the susceptibility of MOS circuits-to lateral charge spreading and subsequent channel formation. Measurements of the temperature, time, and stress voltage dependence of the induced channel conductance are described, and these lead to the specification of the standardized stress conditions for the test procedure. The observed temperature dependence is consistent with an activation energy of 1 eV for the charge spreading mechanism. Choice of an appropriate stress voltage is dependent upon field oxide, substrate, and protective overcoat material parameters, in relation to the physical site of the charge spreading. Measurements to separate charge spreading at the overcoat-field oxide interface or in the film bulk are described. The standardized test procedure has been validated for use as a process control by correlating its results with the life test behavior of MOS integrated circuits having various types of overcoat materials. Inversion failure rates of these circuits subjected to conventional life test procedures are found to be proportional to the induced channel conductances observed in the accelerated process control test."
"Electron Bombarded Semiconductor or EBS Power Devices have presented some unique reliability problems to the developers. Recently many of the design difficulties have been overcome and devices have now demonstrated over 3000 hours of operation. This paper briefly discusses some of the reliability improvements and describes the development of reliable, radiation resistant semiconductor targets."
"Improper coverage of surface topography can lead to a variety of reliability and yield problems in electron devices. The nature of coverage defects and failure mechanisms is discussed, and techniques for improving the reliability by chemical tapering processes and/or optimized film deposition methods are reviewed and classified. Specific examples of experimental conditions are given for obtaining tapered edges of delineated films by chemical and by fusion techniques. Means for achieving improved step coverage by deposited films are also outlined. Several examples of applications to device processing are presented in the experimental part of the paper. A novel electrical process control method utilizing noise measurements in a selected frequency range is demonstrated to be an extremely sensitive tool for rapidly determining variations in the cross-sectional area of conductor films. Experimental results are given to illustrate the applicability of the new method for evaluating taper angles from 3 to 90°."
 "It has been found that a tri-layer metal contact system, consisting of platinum silicide-titanium-platinum-gold, is at least a factor of five better than a comparable aluminum metalized device with respect to humidity. However, all gold metalized devices are not necessarily this good; an example is given. To evaluate bond integrity, a liquid-to-liquid thermal shock is used followed by a high temperature parameter readout. Data is presented from long-tenm life tests which indicate that reliable plastic devices are not adversely effected after five cycles of thermal shock. Also presented is data indicating acceleration factors for salt atmosphere testing of silicone packages. Finally, problems with procurement of reliable plastic encapsulated semiconductors are discussed from a user's viewpoint."
"Two orders of magnitude improvement in the reliability of plastic packages has been achieved as the result of a systematic study of basic failure mechanisms and the development of improved materials, handling procedures and process controls. This improved integrated-circuit packaging system has resulted in plastic-encapsulated product capable of matching the reliability of hermetic packages under severe environmental stress."
"The response of aluminum thin films to single shot, constant current pulses was investigated to seek a ZAP test method for screening out inadequate metal coverage. At current density J, constant cross section stripes melt and open in time durations, tm and to respectively, which obey adiabatic heating laws J2tm - Km and J2to = Ko if heating time is sufficiently brief to minimize heat loss to the substrate. During ZAP testing of metal stripes, which have reduced cross sections as they cover oxide steps, the heat input needed to open the thin spots was significantly greater than predicted values because of lateral heat flow to the thicker portions of the metal stripes. However, the test method is capable of readily differentiating, in 7KÅ to 10KÅ A1 films, stripes with 30% step coverage from those with 45% coverage (and both from flat, 100% coverage, metal) solely by the measured burnout time. In summary, the potential utility of ZAP testing as a metal coverage screen was demonstrated."
"Scanning electron microscopy is widely used to screen step coverage of interconnects on planar semiconductor devices. Utilization of this method has produced many sampling plans. This paper presents the results of a SEM examination of regional and slice-to-slice variances of oxide step contours and metal coverage. High-current pulse testing of aluminum stripes crossing oxide steps was also investigated as an electrical alternative to a SEM screen. The results of this study indicate that when slice-to-slice variances in oxide contour can occur, the quality of metallization must be judged on a slice basis and a SEM examination of each type step in a relatively small region adequately characterizes the slice."
"Degradation modes and mechanisms of III-V compound LED'S with epoxy lenses have been investigated. Degradation of epoxy lenses was first examined under various conditions. Degradation of light transmission characteristics, which plays an important role in the degradation of LED'S, was expressed as functions of temperature, wavelength and time. Degradation of diodes was next examined. Degradation of light output under forward biased conditions was expressed as functions of current density, ambient temperature and time for both unpassivated and passivated LED'S. The activation energy of degradation of light output was ca. 0.4 eV for unpassivated LED'S and was ca. 0.8 eV for passivated LED'S, respectively. Influence of water vapor upon light output was also investigated."
"The direct imposition of compressive mechanical stress during forward bias aging has been found to accelerate the degradation rate of diffused GaAs electroluminescent diodes by over an order of magnitude. The accelerated degradation occurs precipitously with increasing mechanical stress beyond the nominal threshold level of ~2×108 dyn/cm2, and is associated primarily with an increase in the initial rapid component of degradation rather than with the long term behavior. Complementary etching studies have established that dislocation generation can occur at the stress levels and temperatures which induce the accelerated degradation in the presence of forward bias. Moreover, both linear and extended defects are found in the substrate regions, remote from the p-n junction, of the diodes which exhibited accelerated degradation. However, the rapid aging behavior requires the presence of forward bias aging current and the continuous imposition of the mechanical stress, and cannot be induced by initial \"prestress\" aging under mechanical stress alone (without forward bias). These results demonstrate that the accelerated aging involves complicated interplay between electrical bias and mechanical stress, with the precise mechanisms for this behavior uncertain."
"Dynamic heating effects in IMPATT diodes were studied for pulse applications, comparing. the thermal characteristics of various commercial device construction techniques. The study considered temperature distribution effects resulting from nonuniform heat flow and power dissipation due to both perfect and imperfect die mounting. A testing technique is proposed which can accurately measure the average junction temperature as a function of time by monitoring the I-V operating point."
"Extensive investigation of the fabrication techniques for GaAs transferred electron diodes for CW and pulsed microwave oscillators have resulted in observed MTBF's in excess of 100,000 hours for properly made devices. Screening controls and an operating temperature criterion have been established for ultrareliable radar transmitter diodes functioning in military environments."
"For the first known time, comprehensive RF life-tests are being run on a microwave power transistor. Previous reliability predictions have been based on DC life-tests. Preliminary data indicates a median life of the order of 106 hours (> 100 years) for a state-of-the-art 30 watt L-Band device operating under normal RF operation. This exceeds the desired device reliability levels in solid-state phased array radars using this device. Tests are being run under two typical pulsed RF conditions: 120 us and 1500 us pulse width at 1.4 GHz. Data has also been generated showing MTF (mean-time-to-failure) under pulsed RF conditions is 2-6 times greater than under CW (continuous wave) conditions. Furthermore, MTF at a given pulse width is shown to be inversely related to the pulse factor. Preliminary failure analysis indicates that the predominate failure mode under extreme stress conditions is the degradation of the emitter-base junction due probably to the dissolution of the SiO2 dielectric layer by the aluminum metallization."
"An accelerated pulsed RF life study of the NSC-2010 L-band power transistor was started to determine suitability for an intended application. The application requires 12.5 W of output power at 1.4 GHz with a collector supply voltage of 28 V. During the study, the RF was pulsed with the pulse width being 1.5 ms, and the duty cycle 50%. Results available indicate that the median life and 0.01 percentile life of the transistor are both greater than the desired life of 1.2 X 106 hours at a junction temperature of 140°C and the electrical conditions indicated above. In addition, the predominant failure mode appears to be emitter-base shorting of the transistor due to the formation of a conductive path between the metalization and the silicon through the dielectric layer."
"A model is presented for electromigration induced failure following the nucleation of grain boundary voids which lengthen by electromigration transport along neighboring grain boundaries. A grain boundary crevasse growing parallel to the electron currentflow does not accelerate failure. However, a crevasse growing perpendicular to the current has three effects: the electron flux near the crack decreases, and the electron flux and stripe temperature increase near the tip, enhancing the tip growth rate. A consideration of these effects yields a stripe lifetime integral which fits the simple form Pn = 1/2(1+.265γΔT0), where γ=;ΔH/kT2 is the temperature coefficient of the diffusion constant and ;ΔT0 is the initial stripe temperature rise. Pulsed d. c. operation causes thermal effects that allow extended lifetimes. Lifetimes are proportional to the reciprocal of the duty cycle for long pulse times. Short pulse times and high repetition rates result in lower average stripe temperatures and allow even longer lifetimes."

"Systems have been installed in several cities in the United States, including Los Angeles, Calif., which allow real-time surveillance and control of freeway traffic. The surveillance function is effected by a system of presence detectors located on the freeways, telemetry, and digital computer processing. Traffic control is effected by using traffic signals to meter traffic entering the freeway through on-ramps. Current research on modeling freeway traffic flow, estimation of traffic conditions from presence-detector data, and control of freeway traffic is utilized to provide a design of a surveillance and control system for a segment of the Hollywood Freeway in Los Angeles. In some aspects of the design, particularly the design of traffic-responsive on-ramp metering algorithms, a sound theoretical foundation which adequately accounts for practical constraints has been established. In other areas, preliminary ideas are presented and approaches to optimal schemes outlined."
"This research is directed toward the development of a scheduling algorithm for large digital computer systems. To meet this goal methods of adaptive control and pattern recognition are applied. As jobs are received by the computer, a pattern recognition scheme is applied to the job in an attempt to classify its characteristics, such as a CPU-bound job, an I/O job, a large memory job, etc. Simultaneously, another subsystem, using a linear programming model, evaluates the overall system performance, and from this information an optimized (or desired) job stream is determined. When the processor requests a new job, it is chosen from the various classifications in an attempt to meet the optimal (or desired) job stream. After the jobs are completely processed, their characteristics are compared to the projected classification produced by the pattern discriminant function. The results are then returned to the discriminant function to update the decision mechanism, a minimum-distance discriminant function. From a systems point of view, this results in an adaptive or self-organizing control system. The overall effect is a dynamic scheduling algorithm. Simulation studies indicated that the scheduler was able to adapt to changing work loads, and it improved the turnaround times significantly. These simulation studies were based on a multiprocessor-uniprogram environment."
"An algorithm is presented for solving all-integer linear programming problems which successively searches hyperplanes parallel to the optimal hyperplane containing the solution to the associated linear programming problem with the integer restrictions suppressed. These hyperplanes are searched for integer solution points using a dynamic programming formulation. Numerical examples of this technique and some computational results are also presented."
"In an investigation of attention sharing between two continuous tasks with independent input-output modes, 11 subjects were tested using a zero-order compensatory control task with three levels of difficulty (input bandwidth) for each subject. On half of the trials, the subjects simultaneously performed a secondary task of verbally shadowing a random auditory input. The results of an intensive time- and frequency-domain analysis of the data suggest and are consistent with a single-channel model of human performance."
"This paper describes a pragmatic question-answering system which was developed for experimental use in a computer-assisted instruction environment. The two primary design goals of this system are 1) the representation of dynamic processes along with their causal interrelationships, and 2) the generation of responses in units of discourse greater than simple sentences. A method of modeling processes with augmented finite-state automata is discussed and is shown to permit efficient inferencing as well as provide a satisfactory deep structure for paragraph generation. Coupled with the dynamic process model is a semantic/conceptual network which contains static or factual information. Examples of the inferencing techniques using both the automaton model and the semantic network are given."
"An interactive system for the generation and editing of Chinese texts using a small computer and a low-cost graphic display device is described. A unified structural approach is taken for character generation, character retrieval, and the defining of new characters. It is estimated that character-retrieval rates of the order of 30 characters per minute may be attained with this system. The system is suitable for use by persons having a working knowledge of Chinese."
"It is desirable to test the linearity of a system without interval-scale measurement of its input and output. Four tests are proposed. The first is a generalization of the superposition principle. If it is satisfied, the system can be regarded as an integral operator, with variable input distortion and variable but monotonic output distortion. The second test concerns invariance of the input distortion over the input and output domains. It is based on a method of reconstructing an unknown variable input distortion by constructing standard sequences (i.e., sequences of input values that are equally spaced with respect to the integral operator). Test three concerns invariance of the output distortion; it generalizes the superposition principle further, to the case of comparing outputs across different points in the output domain. The fourth test is simply commutativity with translations; if it is satisfied, as well as the first two tests, then the system also satisfies the third test and, in addition, it can be written as a convolution integral."

 "Summary form only given, as follows. Dr. Jaime R. Carbonell, who was a member of the Administrative Committee of the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society, died suddenly on February 2, 1973, at age 44 from cardiac arrest. Dr. Carbonell was Manager of the Artificial Intelligence Department at Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc., and an Associate Editor of the SMC TRANSACTIONS. At BBN he had conducted studies in the development of models of time-sharing systems, pilot-behavior in instrument flying, and man-computer interaction. Recently, he had done pioneering work in the application of artificial intelligence techniques to man-computer interaction. In this work, he developed the SCHOLAR system, a computeraided instruction system which both asks and answers questions in dialogue with a student. In addition to his own contribution to mixed-initiative systems in education, he had a forceful and inspiring influence on his colleagues."
"The use of simulation in the design of an airport passenger terminal building is considered. Results from a typical study are shown and discussed. The conclusion is drawn that whereas a conventional simulation approach offers many advantages in describing reality, the cost and complexity of analysis make it an impractical operative tool. Instead, a simpler method is suggested which may be used in conjunction with simulation or in its own right. The implications of this method are discussed in regard to 1) design and evaluation of a model; 2) reduction of variance and improved efficiency in use of simulation; and 3) integrated real-time management/computer control."
"A simulation model of water pollution dynamics for computer-aided analysis of water quality along an estuary is developed. The model is based on the analytical solution of the diffusion equation describing the pollution concentration when the vertical and lateral dynamics of the estuary are negligible. The estuary is simulated by a cascade connection of uniform distributed parameter networks which represent estuary segments. Each distributed parameter network is treated as a two-port device whose input-output characteristics in the frequency domain are given by its transmission matrix. An algorithm is given for approximating the two-port parameters to any prescribed accuracy so that the two-port dynamics can be synthesized as an active lumped-parameter electrical network. This network, when used with a computer-aided circuit analysis program, yields the pollution concentration profile along the estuary."
"A semi-Markovian population model can be used to describe patient movements in a health-care delivery system. The recovery progress of a patient at any time is defined by one of a finite number of \"states.\" The movement of a patient among the states is governed by a discrete-time semi-Markov process which is called a \" path.\" The inputs to the system are various patient \"groups.\" Each group is characterized by a distinct input distribution with known mean and variance. Assuming that the input distributions are relatively stable in the long run, estimates of the means and variances of steady-state census mix are derived. On a short-term basis, the model will accommodate daily fluctuations in input distributions and use an information vector, which summarizes the state of the system at the time of prediction, to improve the estimation. An illustrative example using field data is presented."
"The relationship between scalp potentials evoked by visual stimulation and neuronal functioning is examined. A neuronal population model for the electrogenesis of the evoked surface potentials is developed which relies on the hypothesis that the surface potentials are a combination of excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs) which occur both at different depths and at different latencies. The model is used to determine the location (depth) of the sources and the approximate size of the neuronal population responsible for the potential. The spatio-temporal potential fields evoked by visual stimulation and monitored by an array of scalp electrodes over the occipital cortex are discussed along with our method for displaying these fields via contour maps. The experimental data are computer simulated via discrete spatially disparate sources. The waveform of each of these sources is determined and the various parameters of the waveform are related to the major characteristics of the spatio-temporal visual evoked potential fields as well as to specific features of the underlying neuronal population. These features include, e.g., the sequence of neuronal excitation, the magnitude of excitatory current, the depth of the neuronal population, and the period of activity of the EPSP and IPSP."
"The growing accuracy and sophistication of models in many fields often lead, paradoxically, to limitations upon their use. Computational cost, excessive input data requirements, and difficulty in interpretation of the implications of the model are typical impediments to the broad use of many complex models. Repro-modeling is an approach which, in many cases, overcomes these problems by creating an efficient input/output approximation to the model. Practical methodological approaches to this straightforward concept are proposed, including a practical algorithm for obtaining a continuous multivariate piecewise linear approximation with subregions of general form given a small randomly distributed set of input/output samples. Three examples of the successful application of repro-modeling are outlined: the impact on air quality of a traffic-restriction policy, the design of effective traffic-responsive freeway on-ramp control algorithms, and the radar return from a complex object."
"The problem of statistical decision making under uncertainty is considered. A Bayes approach based upon prior probabilities which are found using an objective inference technique developed by Kashyap is proposed as the basic solution procedure. The problem is formulated in a statistical decision theory format and the general solution technique is outlined. Using this inference technique, it is possible to have different priors for different experiments. A general decision criterion is formulated to handle these situations. It is shown that in situations where the experimentation is fixed and the decision problem is faced repeatedly, but not necessarily an infinite number of times, this approach is justifiable. In situations where there is a choice of experiments, these arguments are not as conclusive; however, the approach still has practical merit as an objective alternative to the minimax approach."
"Closed-loop and open-loop controls are found for systems with unknown parameters. Use of the prior information is made by objectively inferring prior probability distributions for the unknown parameters and then selecting the control gains which minimize the resulting risks."
"This paper considers several aspects of parameter estimation using least-squares polynomial smoothing of noisy observations. These aspects are 1) the choice of estimation times, 2) the simultaneous or independent use of data, and 3) the use of a polynomial of improper degree to fit the observations. Mathematical expressions are presented for determining the significance of these aspects for any case of interest. Examples are included which show the importance of these aspects."
"Designing compensators with prespecified gain and phase properties has long been a trial-and-error exercise. Some recent efforts to optimize the filter-design process have generated a least-squares fit to some desired filter function. A new technique is presented which optimizes the design process in the L2 sense subject to performance inequality (feasibility) constraints. The achieved filter is shown to be locally optimal as well as feasible. In addition, the developed algorithm can be used to seek a minimal-order optimal filter."

"This primarily tutorial paper on the use of binary matrices in system modeling also includes new material related to the initial development of such matrices. The decomposition of binary matrices into levels such that all feedback is contained within the levels is illustrated. A method for developing a binary matrix en route to a structural model of a system is outlined. The development procedure partitions the matrix on the basis of supplied data entries. Then the interconnections between subsystems are added. This procedure permits transitivity to be used in developing the matrix."
"At present, many metropolitan sewer systems do not meet existing and proposed standards on water pollution. Existing systems were designed to overflow at prescribed locations in order to protect the sewage treatment plants whenever severe overload conditions exist (usually during storms). This discharge of untreated overflows into natural receiving waters is of growing concern to water pollution control authorities. The model considered in this paper is representative of the combined storm-sewer systems in cities such as Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minn., Seattle, Wash., and San Francisco, Calif. The objective is to utilize the total storage capacity available in the system in such a manner as to minimize the water pollution resulting from overflows at individual points within the system. In addition, it is required that no abrupt changes in control be admitted, as this is likely to lead to undesirable surges. The nonlinear model is shown to fit within the framework of an optimal regulator problem with derivative constraints. The optimal feedback control law is derived and compared with the optimal bang-bang controller. The solution technique that is presented may be applied to many combined storm-sewer systems in which the flows through the systems to the treatment plants may be controlled. It may be used by city engineers to determine necessary modifications to existing systems in order to meet the new standards regarding water pollution."
"An adaptive threshold element is able to \"learn\" a strategy of play for the game blackjack (twenty-one) with a performance close to that of the Thorp optimal strategy although the adaptive system has no prior knowledge of the game and of the objective of play. After each winning game the decisions of the adaptive system are \"rewarded.\" After each losing game the decisions are \"punished.\" Reward is accomplished by adapting while accepting the actual decision as the desired response. Punishment is accomplished by adapting while taking the desired response to be the opposite of that of the actual decision. This learning scheme is unlike \"learning with a teacher\" and unlike \"unsupervised learning.\" It involves \"bootstrap adaptation\" or \"learning with a critic.\" The critic rewards decisions which are members of successful chains of decisions and punishes other decisions. A general analytical model for learning with a critic is formulated and analyzed. The model represents bootstrap learning per se. Although the hypotheses on which the model is based do not perfectly fit blackjack learning, it is applied heuristically to predict adaptation rates with good experimental success. New applications are being explored for bootstrap learning in adaptive controls and multilayered adaptive systems."
"A new learning model is proposed, which is quite different from the usual ones in both function and structure. In the usual models only the classification function of input patterns is learned. On the other hand, the proposed learning machine can memorize input patterns themselves by a learning process. That is, an input pattern appears on the output plane of the machine if it has been presented to the machine often enough and does not appear if it has been presented infrequently. Since a man can remember or actually sketch patterns, he not only classifies but probably also memorizes patterns themselves by learning. This machine can therefore be said to simulate a phase of brain functioning. As for structure, the new machine consists of an iteration of nonlinear and spatially local processing instead of the usual single processing with linear discriminant functions. Both a general analysis and experimental results are given, and the machine is shown to have the expected behavior."
"The human decision maker's behavior when predicting future states of discrete linear dynamic systems driven by zero-mean Gaussian processes is modeled. The task is on a slow enough time scale that physiological constraints are insignificant compared with cognitive limitations. The model is basically a linear regression system identifier with a limited memory and noisy observations. Experimental data are presented and compared to the model."
"A combined manual and decision task may be viewed as an arrangement of subtasks, one or more of which involves uncertainty due to some input random process I(X). Very little is known about the relationship between the subtask performance times and I(X), particularly in an operational environment. An experiment was run involving a task containing a 4-alternative choice decision subtask. The other subtasks involved motions that have been found to be typical of many operational environments. The probabilistic conditions that were varied over the 4-alternative choice element consisted of six discrete probability functions for each of two distinct structures: independent (random sequences) and Markov dependent. The subtask performance time distributions were found to fit gamma's, but tended to independent approximate normal variates as subjects progressed toward fully learned states. For fully learned subjects the only subtask affected by the uncertainty was the decision subtask, and these effects did not vary significantly between the independent and Markov structures. Subjects employed a motion strategy at the decision subtask that was a function of the most probable stimulus. The results provide factors pertinent to systems design and evaluation in general."
"The regional planning of health care facilities is treated as a process of searching, integrating, screening, matching, evaluating, and selecting the type of facilities most suitable for the physical and socioeconomic environment in which the facilities are to be constructed. A rational procedure which matches various possible combinations of environmental features and performance characteristics of potential facility types is presented, and the process of determining the location and the extent of services of a facility in the region by means of sophisticated computer programming techniques is discussed in detail."
"This paper describes, in a polemical way, the possible ways for synthesis of artificial gait, taking into account its application in the rehabilitation of severely disabled paraplegics. The essential relation between the hierarchical control concept of artificial legged locomotion systems and human beings has been treated. The method of prescribed synergy has been described in detail. This method, in the author's opinion, renders wide possibilities in solving delicate problems in the synthesis and control of artificial anthropomorphic gait. The possibility of applying the gait-logic description in the synthesis of finite automata and the possibility of driving system hybridization in the rehabilitation of persons with muscular insufficiency have also been considered."
"Planning of new and expanded health facilities is and will continue to be a necessary function as the demand for better health care increases. Physical facility design and the establishment of staffing patterns are basic administrative decisions which must be made long before the health center opens. The effect of these decisions on patient flow is critical. The simulation model described in this paper was constructed to test the effects of alternative designs and patterns."

 "This is a semitutorial paper to explain, from the systems engineering viewpoint, the basic principles of Leontief's input-output economic analysis and its extension to study environmental repercussions in the economy. An advantage of the systems engineering interpretation is that it makes the input-output analysis intuitively clear and suggests or facilitates certain extensions of Leontief's results."
"In this semitutorial paper, economic models based on fundamental principles of conservation of mass and energy are developed. These models consider labor as a cost rather than a flow as in classical input-output analysis. This minor shift in concept makes it possible to include technical economies of scale in production and transportation as an additive nonlinearity to the cost equation. These economies of scale are shown to be of central concern in evaluating the tradeoffs between production \"efficiency\" and environmental and social costs incurred by excessive spatial concentration and regional specialization of production and consumption processes. Well-known concepts in engineering are used to develop mass-energy economic models of production systems that have all the basic characteristics of classical economic input-output models and more. The theories and concepts are illustrated by example."
"Input-output models are attractive for the study of pollution problems because they can trace pollutant flows through the whole economy. The purpose of this paper is to show how input-output models, while easily adaptable for the case of pollution generated by producers and falling on consumers, are unable to handle pollution affecting producers and then to show how an essentially neoclassical model of pollution falling on producers can be put into an input-output context. In the neoclassical model pollution affecting producers has a dual effect on commodity prices and resource endowments. The dual effects of pollution are then interpreted by appealing to two theorems of international trade."
"This paper reports upon a project intended to hypothesize and implement with data methods for linking input-output structures and environmental emissions in order to provide suitable means for modeling and analyzing the emissions process. The first step in the effort was to devise a materials balance accounting structure in order to provide a coherent and complete format for emissions. This accounting structure was incorporated in a set of worksheets and instructions and distributed among relevant government agencies. The data collected from this effort, with substantial internally developed data, have been used to create a simple two-stage model of the emissions process. It is recommended that this approach be enhanced through more detailed study of treatment processes in terms of materials flows and economic costs. Integration of superior treatment process data into the existing structure would permit a much more flexible, detailed, and accurate model for projection and policy analysis purposes."
"Some results on the environmental implications of economic growth in the United States from 1970 to 2000, obtained using conventional input-output analysis, are presented. The input-output model, as constructed, allows various projections, each associated with specific policy assumptions, to be pursued. Chosen here were two population assumptions (U.S. Census Series B, and Census Series E) coupled with two economic growth assumptions both pegged to labor productivity of different levels. This yielded four basic scenarios: high population and high economic growth, low population and low growth, and two intermediary cases. The environmental implications were entered in the form of two policy assumptions-continuation of the 1970 environmental policy and strict enforcement of all current environmental legislation. Several conclusions may be drawn from this analysis: if waste treatment is not intensified, even the low-population low-growth rate scenario yields significant increases in current pollution levels by the year 2000; increases in population level bears less influence upon environmental quality than the increases in the standard of living; capital investments in state-of-the-art production technologies are necessary if waste treatment costs are to be held to a low level; the treatment cost/GNP ratio will increase by a factor of 2.1 to 3.7 in the next decade, dependent upon abatement policy pursued, and increase by a factor of 2.8 to 4.8 in the next 30 years; and the economy can absorb this increase in treatment costs without major social cost, particularly with early capital investment by industry in production technology."
"The technical and capital coefficients of a dynamic regional input-output model are being revised to include the costs of installing and operating air pollution abatement equipment. The total cost of air pollution abatement in the region will be estimated by comparing the value of direct and indirect inputs required to produce a fixed bill of goods before and after the installation of abatement equipment."
"An approach to the construction of a regional input-output model for the analysis of solid waste problems is outlined. Building upon an available conventional static regional input-output model, three models are presented; each is nested inside the other and leading to the proposed model. These models are a) a simple model of production and waste generation; b) a production and waste disposition model; and c) a production, disposition, and reclamation model. An approach to the assessment of the role of the material reclamation industries in a regional economy is thereby suggested. It centers on the contribution material reclamation industries make to total output of conventional producing industries. The analysis suggests the way to the evaluation of material reclamation industries (which tends also to reclaim unutilized labor) in terms of a broad regional development policy related to solid-waste management."
"A systems model to describe the production of energy is developed. The model considers the efficiency and environmental impact of each stage (extraction, storage, conversion, transmission, etc.) of alternative energy-producing chains (e.g., electric power from coal, oil, etc.). The analytical form of the model is identical to an input-output scheme with technological coefficients that depend upon the specific inputs and efficiencies of each of the stages. An example is presented to show the application of the model to analyze the relationships between energy systems' efficiency and environmental impact."
"Governments have at their disposal a growing arsenal of measures, such as taxes, incentives, regulations, and effluent charges, for limiting harmful industrial emissions at the source, over a region, or at the national level. Such measures may have far-reaching implications for consumers, the economy, the quality of the environment, the structure of industry, and the development of resources and technology. The nature of these implications should be assessed before specific measures are implemented. We have constructed and computerized a static model designed to assess some of the steady-state consequences of various pollution abatement strategies on an industry. This model, called \"Process-Chain Evaluation Model\" (PCEM), estimates the cumulative costs of various processes or steps that form \"chains\" leading from a set of raw material inputs to a marketable output such as semi-finished or consumer products. It then evaluates the added cost of sales due to specific environmental control measures. Often several alternate processes or chains of processes are feasible, leading to the same end product. In that case, the model helps identify those chains which are most economical and environmentally least harmful under various assumed policies. Presumably the most economical chains will, with time, come to dominate the industry making the end product in question, unless the imposed policies put this industry at a competitive disadvantage with respect to others. In that case, the end product may, in time, be displaced by substitutes. The dynamic effects of process or product substitution are quite important and can also be modeled."
"Effective enforcement of no-parking regulations is essential in urban areas. A probabilistic finite-state machine model that relates enforcement to expected levels of compliance is developed, and its simulation results are shown to agree with experimental data. The effects of deterministic and random enforcement policies are described, and a class of implementable policies that yield satisfactory results is analyzed. Finally, these results are used to determine schedules and routes for enforcement officers that increase their effectiveness."
"Texture is one of the important characteristics used in identifying objects or regions of interest in an image, whether the image be a photomicrograph, an aerial photograph, or a satellite image. This paper describes some easily computable textural features based on gray-tone spatial dependancies, and illustrates their application in category-identification tasks of three different kinds of image data: photomicrographs of five kinds of sandstones, 1:20 000 panchromatic aerial photographs of eight land-use categories, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) multispecial imagery containing seven land-use categories. We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications."
"Power system operation is outlined and system security is defined. The need for security evaluation in power system operation is discussed, and the evaluation is presented as a pattern recognition problem. A suitable straightforward and quick procedure is used to select a small number of variables as features from a large set of variables which are normally available in power systems. Comparison is made on the security classification performances of a number of different types ot classifiers. The training of classifiers is carried out by a search algorithm which seeks to minimize the number of classification errors. The procedure to determine the security functions (classifiers) is illustrated by an example, and simulation results on the steady-state security of the CIGRE 225-kV system show that the pattern recognition approach to security evaluation is encouraging. Some uses of security functions in the control and operation of power systems are outlined. The effect of many of these uses cannot be achieved as easily by other existing methods. Finally, some of the problems associated with the application of pattern recognition to power system security evaluation are discussed."

"A new class of junction field-effect transistor (JFET) circuit is introduced, which can serve as a simple versatile building block in instrumentation applications. Economical realizations of current-to-voltage converters, voltage-controlled voltage sources, and voltage-controlled current sources are described. The basic circuit building block, called the piggy-back pair, consists of a matched pair of JFET's and two resistors. The basic configuration is easily manipulated to realize various circuit functions when combined with a few other components. It is shown that by full utilization of the terminal properties of JFET's, many simple high-performance circuits can be designed, which have circuit functions determined essentially by resistor ratios and which accordingly are relatively insensitive to device parameters. The circuit design procedure is very straightforward with design limitations clearly indicated. The flexibility and versatility of the piggy-back pair is indicated by the wide range of circuits demonstrated."
"Clock synchronization experiments were carried out May 10 to June 10, 1971, by the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory via the ATS-1 and ATS-3 geostationary satellites between the NASA tracking stations at Rosman, N. C., and Mojave, Calif., in order to determine the offset and the relative drift rate between the two station clocks. Pulses at C band with very sharp rise time and of 10-μs duration were exchanged by the two stations through the dual transponders of the satellites. At each station, a time-interval counter was started by the transmitted pulse and stopped by the pulse received via satellite from the other station. The probable error of the clock offset as measured by the counter is 10 ns. A very long baseline interferometer (VLBI) experiment was also performed between the two stations at the same time and provided independent clock-offset data to check the accuracy of the time-synchronization experiment."
"Optical telemetry of the ECG from a patient to a power-line operated display can be safely done without the nuisances normally associated with battery-operated equipment. Such instrumentation can also be designed for reliability, convenience and simplicity of use, adherence to current standards (medical and electronic), and ease of repair without compromising performance parameters. Using novel techniques, we have designed an ECG system that meets American Heart Association standards, uses no special components, and operates continuously from a pair of 1.5 V AA penlight cells for more than 5 months. Electrical safety is ensured by an inexpensive 6-ft-long flexible fiber-optic cable between the battery-powered patient package and the power-line operated display."
"A crucial measurement in the Astron device of the controlled thermonuclear research program is to monitor a small (10-G) transient magnetic field caused by a moving group of electrons. The Astron device involves high currents, large magnetic fields, radiation problems, and gigantic radio frequency (RF) noise. The evolution of a Hall device gaussmeter to directly measure this phenomenon is explained. The result is a simple device for the measurement of a small signal buried in noise of the combined form of large magnetic field, RF power, gamma radiation, and high dc currents."
"In a laser Doppler velocimeter the signal arises from the superposition of several pulses at random phase, and the instantaneous frequency recorded at the output, which is a measure of the velocity, contains an ambiguity component due to this effect. A statistical analysis is presented that predicts the ambiguity for both the mask and the Gaussian beam velocimeters and the results are shown to be in close agreement with experiment. Based on this theory, a computer simulation model has been developed that is a useful tool for analyzing and optimizing the parameters in a particular system. Finally, the specific applications of turbulence measurement in fluid flow is considered in more detail."
"A sinusoidal voltage source of frequency nominally 10/2π kHz (w = 104 rad/s) is derived from a 5-MHz standard. Digital counters are used to generate the required frequency, which differs from 10/2π kHz by less than 2 parts in 108, and is as stable as the standard. Using a crystal filter and low-distortion amplifiers, an output of 10 V rms with total harmonic distortion less than 1 part in 103 is obtained."
"In many experiments, one is faced with the problem of measuring the time constant of decaying signals. The paper describes a simple electronic system that permits the direct measurement of time constants. The system was used in connection with relaxation experiments on hydrogen and rubidium masers and was found to operate well. The use of a computing counter in the systems gives the possibility of making averages on several experiments and obtaining the standard deviation of the results from the mean. The program for the computing counter is given."
"A modified infinite sample method for routine permittivity measurements of granular or powder as well as liquid materials is described. The method permits continuous monitoring of the temperature, moisture content, and density of the test sample. Analytical and graphical solutions, which lead to the material permittivity from experimental data and measurement uncertainty, are presented. The method is particularly valuable when a large number of samples must be tested as a function of temperature, moisture content, and density, or when a continuous monitoring of the permittivity is required during irradiation by microwave power."
"A system is described whereby a single-circle powder diffractometer is controlled by means of a punched paper tape program. An ASR33 teletype machine is used for both the input and output of data, the output being in a form directly suitable for further computer analysis. It is shown that by developing a hardware control system specifically for this task considerable increase in efficiency can be achieved for a relatively low cost."
"Analog models provide a cheap and effective method for identification and checkout of a wide range of physical systems via the transfer function concept. This paper reviews the excitation of series, parallel, and pi mode analog models by deterministic stimuli. Errors between the system and model responses may be displayed on a cathode-ray tube, or on an instrument measuring mean-error modulus. Novel methods of tuning the model coefficients by observing the error displays are described and evaluated experimentally. The checkout strategy is particularly suitable for use by technicians since reliable repeatable models are obtained independent of the level of operator understanding of the system under test. These models may then be used as input data for quality control of production items and for preventive maintenance schemes during the life of the system under test. A low-order model is shown to be perfectly adequate for dynamic performance checkout of a complex noisy nonlinear system. Intermediate access points then permit elemental modeling down to replaceable units. For adequate confidence in system dynamic performance, checkout tolerances placed on the model coefficients must be conditional and a suitable tolerance flow chart is included. Although presented on the basis of manual instrumentation, the methodology is suitable for automation and is applicable to self-adaptive systems in which system dynamics change slowly with time."
"A new method for the measurement of Q factors of reflection (single-ended) and transmission (double-ended) resonators has been developed. The basis of the technique is the locking of an oscillator to some point away from the center of the resonator response curve. This is accomplished by the introduction of a phase offset into a conventional oscillator-resonator stabilization circuit so as to make the stabilizer sensitive to both the real and imaginary portions of the voltage transfer coefficient of the resonator. From a determination of the phase and frequency shifts, the Q factor may be evaluated. The frequency-lock method shows promise of having significant advantages in speed, convenience, and accuracy over previous techniques. The basic features of this approach were successfully demonstrated in a measurement of the Q factor of an X-band reflection cavity. A circuit for fully automatic Q determinations is proposed. In this mode of operation, the device should be insensitive to changes in the eigen-frequency of the resonator and should be capable of measuring very small changes in Q."
"A method is described for measuring the center of mass of uniform object-images using a two-dimensional array system. Measurement error in the center of mass is computed for various images projected in different positions with respect to the array matrix. The effects of two types of two-dimensional image perturbation on measurement accuracy are analyzed."
"A time comparison method, which is based on TV synchronization pulses sent along radio links, was proposed and successfully tested in Czechoslovakia in 1967. Experiments performed afterwards in Europe and the U. S. confirmed the significance of this method. The instability of the overall propagation time delay along the radio links (including the equipment) is the major source of errors for long-term timekeeping between remote laboratories. In 1969, a research project on this subject was initiated in Italy, using the comparison of simultaneous time measurements by the TV method and integrated phase measurements via a coaxial cable between two remote laboratories that were located in Rome and Turin, Italy. The results show that the discrepancy between the TV results and the direct comparison by cable, over periods of 100 days, is usually less than 3 μs."
"This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation into the problem of tooth-ripple losses in the laminated poles of rotating machines. The losses are measured by measuring the Poynting vector in the air-gap region of the machine between the surface of the poles and the slotted armature. Specially designed probes are used to measure the electric and magnetic fields and the signals from these probes are processed to give the required Poynting vector. This method also enables the direct measurement of the loss due to each individual harmonic under actual running conditions with all the harmonics simultaneously present. The experimental results are quite interesting in themselves and can also serve as a basis for comparing the various methods of calculating these losses. A comparison between the measured losses and those calculated on the basis of linear electromagnetic theory is also given."
"A system is described that avoids false synchronization of the trigger on signals arriving while the hold-off circuit is resetting, thus preventing the apparent shifting of displayed waveforms. The effectiveness of the system is illustrated by results obtained with different oscilloscopes and signals."
"A simple method of determining the dielectric constant of sheet materials is described. For lossless and low-loss materials, the dielectric constant may be evaluated by a simple measurement of the guide wavelength in the presence of the dielectric. Since the latter measurement can be made accurately using simple standard equipment, the method gives good results. For medium or high-loss materials, it is necessary to measure the attenuation as well and solve a transcendental equation. However, the simplicity and the greater accuracy possible in the physical measurements make this method more accurate than previous methods."
"The design of a simple logic tester producing audio outputs is described. These audio outputs are distinct frequencies, approximately an octave apart, and correspond to the logic states '0,' '1,' and 'fault,' as defined for transistor-transistor logic (TTL) integrated circuits. The tester can be easily modified to detect pulses or logic levels of other types of circuits. It is expected that such a testing circuit will provide a useful aid in undergraduate digital laboratories."

"A computer oriented method is developed for optimum design of magnetic circuits with permanent magnets. It consists of finding an electrical equivalent for the magnetic circuit and writing a computer program that evaluates the various circuit elements, solves the resulting network equations, computes the leakage and reluctance factors, and solves the design equations iteratively. The design can be carried out to satisfy criteria such as minimum magnet volume or minimum material cost. The program can also be used to obtain the expected performance of specified designs thus allowing the designer to evaluate his design ideas without excessive prototype building. The execution time is of the order of a few seconds, and the designer can use the program in interactive mode thus saving substantial engineering time."
"A frequency-to-voltage converter is described, for use as a control circuit in a voltage-controlled oscillator with a 100-kHz central frequency, varying within an octave on either side. Conversion is effected by averaging standard pulses of constant width and constant height, corresponding to the zero cross of each cycle of the measured frequency. Accuracy of 0.01 percent and better is secured by determining the pulsewidth by an exact digital system and determining the pulseheight by switching an exact current source. The range of measurement and response time may be varied by the user in accordance with his optimization requirements."
"Infrared frequencies have recently been synthesized in suitable diodes up to 88 THz with accuracies of parts in 109. Stabilized lasers are necessary in order to make frequency measurements of higher accuracy. The hydrogen-cyanide laser is the lowest frequency basis laser used in these synthesis schemes, and its stabilization has been the subject of recent interest. The laser is stabilized by locking it to a phase-locked microwave reference chain. Two servo loops are utilized. The first loop is a relatively slow frequency-lock loop with the correction applied to a piezoelectric-translator driver. This loop not only accommodates thermal expansion of the laser, but also serves as an acquisition aiding loop for the second servo. The latter is a phase-locked system with the correction applied to the laser discharge current controller. Data regarding the system stability are presented."
"Apparatus employing a half-sine-wave pulse for the adiabatic firing of electroexplosive devices is described. Basic energy equations and their interpretation are developed, and some experimental observations for characterizing an insensitive electroexplosive device are presented."
"In modern paper making, accurate methods for measuring speed are of remarkable importance. The use of a time-to-speed converter for speed measurement leads to considerably shorter measuring times and more accurate results than are achieved with conventional methods. In this paper, algorithms usable in digital time-to-speed converters are analyzed, classified, and compared. Finally, the design of a time-to-speed converter based on the algorithm most suitable for paper speed measurement is described."
"A simplified model of the transistor sustaining stage employed in common quartz-crystal oscillators is presented. Examination of the model, including associated noise sources, provides an explanation for general differences observed in the output-frequency spectra of several types of widely used self-limiting crystal oscillator circuits. A self-limiting quartz-crystal oscillator circuit configuration is described that has been specifically designed to exhibit simultaneously each of the three important circuit characteristics necessary for improved oscillator short-term frequency/phase stability: large value of oscillator resonator loaded Q, adequate suppression of 1/f flicker-of-phase type noise, and improvement in oscillator ultimate signal-to-noise ratio. Several models of the oscillator circuit have been constructed employing high quality third overtone 5-MHz AT- and BT-cut quartz resonators. Measurement of oscillator short-term frequency stability using conventional phase lock and sampling techniques confirm attainment of substantial improvement in oscillator short-term frequency stability when compared to conventional self-limiting oscillator circuits."
"In ordinary oscilloscopes, the brilliance of the trace depends strongly on the deflection speed of the beam. With the circuit described here, a uniform optimal brightness of the oscillograms is obtained independently of the shape of the curve and the frequency of repetition. Thus even steep slopes are well visible from a distance, and manual adjustment of the brightness becomes superfluous. This is especially important in lecture demonstrations. A protective circuit limits the cathode current so that a standing beam cannot burn out the screen. The circuits were designed for large color picture tubes, but they are also suitable, in a simplified form, for improving monochromatic oscilloscopes [1]. In lage picture tubes, the relation between the beam deflection and the deflection currents is not linear. The resulting distortions on the screen call for proper correction signals. These while depending on x- and y-beam positions, must not be influenced by the deflection frequency."
"A method for measuring the peak voltage of a narrow impulse is described. The circuit uses a pulse-lengthener circuit with a preamplifier. The use of the amplifier reduces the charging time constant of the pulse-lengthener circuit to improve the speed capability of the circuit. An experimental circuit which employed a microwave transistor amplifier was capable of detecting an impulse as short as 14 ns in duration. The meter deflection was held constant for easy readout by A/D and D/A converters until the A/D converter was reset."
"A new device for calibrating current over wide frequency and dynamic ranges with sufficient accuracy is presented. The calibration of the ammeter under test can easily be made with secondary standards as the current monitors are calibrated by utilizing a thermocouple-type ammeter and a short-circuited-ring-type electrodynamic ammeter. The merit of this calibration method is that the magnitude of current passing through the ammeter under test can be equalized to that of the electrodynamic ammeter."
"This paper reports experimental and theoretical studies and their comparisons on the sensitivity of photoelectric methods for detecting very weak optical signals based on the analog and digital techniques. The single photoelectron counting and the enhanced single photoelectron counting methods were found to be advantageous over the other methods with regard to both signal-to-noise ratio and effective range for optical input powers. Furthermore, the measurements of extra-weak spontaneous bioluminescence from living tissues such as tumors and livers of mice and rats were performed as a new application of the detection methods discussed and evaluated."
"We consider the characterization of the frequency stability of signal generators by means of the Allan variance of their fractional frequency fluctuations. As the number m of measurements is always finite, one can only get an estimate of this variance, which is a random function of m. We calculate the variance of the Allan variance for commonly encountered spectral densities of frequency fluctuations and deduce the relative uncertainty in the evaluation of frequency stability, as a function of m. The theory is experimentally checked for white noise of phase and flicker noise of frequency. The main hypothesis of the calculations, i.e., the Gaussian character of frequency fluctuations is verified. The m dependence of the uncertainty (one sigma) in the evaluation of frequency stability agrees with the predicted value."
"The principle of operation of a novel linear time-delay circuit is described. The circuit is based on the Miller integrator principle and incorporates the ramp-generating function, the amplitude comparison, and the resetting action into a gate-generating circuit. The linearity of the sweep voltage is the highest possible that can be obtained with one transistor ramp generator. Wide delay range with a single timing capacitor and high duty cycle is obtained."
"Two-port coaxial mounts to measure power, voltage, and current from audio to 36 GHz are described. These mounts need no RF calibration (thus eliminating accuracy degradation in the calibration hierarchy) and remove serious difficulties in measurements and equipment evaluation."
"The effect of the biasing circuit configuration on the output noise spectra of the vacuum photodiode was investigated. It was found that under certain biasing circuit conditions, the output noise spectra were frequency dependent, resembling the 1/f noise spectrum at moderate frequencies. This similarity and its cause should be noted to avoid possible misinterpretation of data or erroneous measurements. Also, the conditions for obtaining white output noise spectra (and thus flat frequency-response curves) are presented. The measured white noise levels were found to be slightly in excess of that predicted by shot noise considerations alone."
"Previously published methods and results for fast recursive estimation of the mean value of a continuous random variable are extended to the case of a random signal quantized by an equi-interval A/D converter."
"A procedure is outlined which furnishes a method for the measurement of the residual inductances of a standard capacitor and a specimen capacitor which are connected parallel to each other for a substitution measurement. From two junction points connected to a reactance meter, i.e., the high-potential and the earth-potential junction points, the residual inductances of both capacitors, including those of each lead wire, are measured to several percentages at 50 MHz without disconnecting any leads or capacitors or the reactance meter."
"The infrared transducer devised, for space applications, at the Office National d'Etudes et de Recherches Aerospatiales (ONERA) incorporates a pneumatic thermal detector combined with a capacitance bridge. Performance data of the assembly are as follows: noise equivalent power at 40 Hz, 2.10-10 W/Hz-1/2; signal bandwidth 200 Hz; sensitive area 3 mm2; spectrum bandwidth 0.4 to 45 = (KRS 5 window). The equipment is designed to stand up under space conditions, such as vibrations, changes in temperature, and vacuum."
"The noise figure at one value of source admittance, plus the variation of output noise power with source admittance, are sufficient for the complete noise characterization of a linear receiver. A standard noise generator of variable admittance is not required. A wide range of source admittances can be used."
"A principle is described whereby an instantaneous voltage proportional to the phase shift of the outputs of two triangular-wave generators can be obtained. By controlling one of the triangular-wave generators with the difference between this voltage and a reference voltage, a certain phase difference between the triangular waves is obtained which can be varied by changing the reference voltage. The system can be used in the frequency range of 0.001 Hz-500 kHz with a phase shift which is variable from, for example, -20° to 380°."
"Previous studies of phase noise contributed by amplifiers and frequency multipliers have indicated the existence of a so-called \"flicker of phase noise law of p-n junction.\" Contradictions of this law were obtained using low-noise transistors in frequency doublers. Schottky barrier diode and vacuum-tube multipliers were compared to the p-n junction devices. The tube doublers exhibited an anomaly, since their phase noise did not change with the application of negative feedback, indicating the possibility that the tubes themselves may be much better than the observed noise. The noise of the transistor doublers was progressively reduced by application of increasing amounts of negative feedback until a lower limit was reached. The noise then remained constant in spite of further increases in the amount of negative feedback. Measurements were obtained on all doublers from 2 Hz to 5 kHz with extrapolation to 1 Hz. During the investigation, a low-flicker-noise low-drift dc preamplifier was developed."
"Filtering out the undesirable mirror frequency fm from the desired frequency f0 poses a problem in UHF on higher frequency ranges if the Ms ratio given by Ms = ∣fm - f0∣/f0 is very small. The application of signed-digit methods for improving the Ms ratio is examined."
"This short paper describes the design of an inexpensive, simple, and reliable solid-state hot-wire anemometer feedback controller for the measurement of turbulence spectra. A summary of the linearized feedback control theory for the application of an operational amplifier in maintaining the active element in a balanced bridge configuration of a hot-wire anemometer at constant temperature is presented."
"A circuit employing one operational amplifier, one dualjunction field-effect transistor, four resistors, and two potentiometers is used to produce a voltage output proportional to the quantity t when the input voltage is related to t by at + bt2, where a and b are constants. The useful operating voltage range, the maximum value of bt/a that can be accommodated, the accuracy of the linearizing process, and the effects of changes in the ambient temperature on the circuit are considered."
"A 1-b digital cross correlator for use in radio astronomy was designed and built at Harvard. Although only 16 channels (lags) were built in hardware, a recycling scheme allows the incoming data to be processed through the correlator several times over to multiply the number of hardware channels by a factor that can be quite large at low sample rates. For example, for a spectral window of 400 kHz, 112 lags can be computed and for 125 kHz, 400 lags. To do this the correlator is connected to a minicomputer (Supernova) for both input and output and so it is treated as a peripheral processor. The same computer performs the Fourier transforms and displays the spectra."
"Sigdell's method of capacitance measurement [1] is generalized to the measurement of admittance and impedances. The generalized method is applied to the digital measurement of inductors and capacitors. The accuracy attainable in the measurement of a perfect capacitor is discussed, and it is shown that this accuracy compares favorably with the accuracy of commercial impedance bridges."

"Analog-to-digital converters (ADC) with logarithmic law are receiving particular attention from system and circuit designers. They can be applied to solve many problems of data acquisition and encoding found in almost all the fields of experimental physics and instrumentation dealing with analog variables with several decades of dynamic range, where a constarnt relative accuracy, rather than a constant absolute accuracy, is required. Spme proposals and realizations of logarithmic ADC (LADC) already presented in the literature are discussed as well as some new ideas organized according to three classes of schemes. The first can be viewed as the cascade connection of an analog logarithmic information converter and a conventional ADC; while in the second, the LADC is entirely digital and follows the ADC; and in the third, the logarithmic conversion and the A/D conversion are performed by the same structure and cannot be easily distinguished. An analysis is made of the performances of the various possible realizations as well as of their complexity."
"The influence of linearity errors on the statistical properties of analog-to-digital converter (ADC) outputs is discussed. It is shown that most ADCs available on the market cannot be used for precise statistical measurements. A measurement technique and an error definition is proposed to allow a careful evaluation of ADCs for statistical measurements."
"A fluid speed measuring system based on Bernoulii's equation of flowing fluid is presented. The necessary square-root extraction is performed numerically to reach the advantages of numerical display and the possibility of using the device as a data source of the computer controlling the process. Simple recursive square-root extraction algorithm is derived and the statistics of the roundoff error is considered."
"A current getlerator has been constructed from two operational amplifiers and a thermostated twin transistor. The current is an exponential function (5) of a controlling voltage. At currents greater than 100 μA, the transistor exhibited a resistive effect, for which it was possible to compensate for internally. The generator was tested over the current range 30 nA-15 mA and was found to perform almost ideally, with a slope of 1.008 of the theoretical and a standard deviation of 0.3 perceht. Some preliminary measurements have shown the generator to be useful down to 10 pA. The use of the generator for electrochemical kinetic measurements is described."
"Some basic difficulties in the implementation of high-speed frequency counters are discussed. A new method which avoids most of these difficulties is described. The method essentially consists of binary prescaling the input frequency to a value easily manageable with decade counters and subsequently multiplying the resultant count in the decade counters by the prescaling factor. A simple digit serial multiplier for this purpose is iliustrated along with the system design of a 150-MHz frequency counter. Finally, the advantages of the new approach are discussed."
"A simple method is described for determining field-induced polarization reversal times in ferroelectrics ranging from seconds to nanoseconds without the use of an oscilloscope. The procedure consists of 1) setting some selected reference state of polarization, preferably by recording a hysteresis loop which is terminated at the reference state, 2) applying a pulse field of known amplitude and duration to reverse a portion or all of the polarization, and 3) tracing a new hysteresis loop. The difference in polarization state between the starting point of the second loop and the termination point of the first is the amount of polarization switched by the pulse field. Data consist of charge densities ⋀Pr switched by the pulse fields of various amplitudes E and durations t. From ⋀Pr versus E plots, the field corresponding to half-switching of the polarization is read for each pulse length applied and a log/log plot of the half-switching time t1/2 versus E is constructed. These log/log plots for lead zirconate-titanate ferroelectrics generally yield, each, three linear segments in which, with increasing field, t1/2 is proportional to E-ß, E-γ, and E-δ and ß>γ>δ."
"Equipment is described for comparing any number N of standard cells which constitute a standard of electromotive force. The scheme is economical, needing only 2N measurements. The cells are disposed in a ring, and there is simple switching to compare each cell with its four neighbors. The calculations are done by a program on a desk calculator. They give the value of each cell with respect to the mean of the group. They also give the rms error, which is typically less than 0.02 μV for one cell in a group of 22. There are safeguards for identifying a spurious measurement and a false keyboard entry."
"The effect of linear systems on transients is analyzed and parameters are introduced which allow one to estimate the error introduced by a system in the reproduction of a signal. Methods of calculating and measuring these parameters are given."
"Noise loading analysis of a mhemoryless nonlinearity characterized by a Taylor series of finite order is presented in terms of the autocorrelation function of the input signal. For narrow-band application, an explicit expression for the noise power ratio at the output of the nonlinearity is given up to seventh-order characteristic. The corresponding 3-tone intermodulation distortion of type ω1 + ω2 - ω3 is also given for comparison."
"Measurements of the short-term stability of the Rb87 maser are reported here. The measurements were made as a function of the maser power output and of the receiver cutoff frequency. The experimental data are compared to theoretical results obtained from an approximate theory. In this theory the transfer function of the maser for thermal noise is derived, and the spectral density of the phase fluctuations is calculated. An analytical expression for the \"Allan variance\" is also given. A comparison of the stability of the Rb87 maser with existing frequency standards shows its superiority for averaging times less than 1 s. We obtain Δf/f ≃ 1.3 × 10-3 ≃-1. A stability of 5 × 10-12 for τ ≃1000 s is also reported."
"Bounds for the minimum energy reflected from certain reactive discontinuities, when excited by time-limited signals, are considered. The implications for the use of time domain reflectometers in detecting small discontinuities are considered."
"The theory of power equations [1], [2] introduced a concept whereby the basic parameter is the net power in the waveguide of interest. Power equations are based on the \"terminal invariant\" parameters: available power, maximum efficiency, and \"mismatch factors.\" The purpose of this paper is to examine the various systems which can be used to satisfy the power equation concept in the transfer of the known effective efficiency of a standard mount to an unknown mount. The equations presented in this paper show that the measurement techniques illustrated in [1], [2] can be simplified. Furthermore, the measurement procedures shown here have been practically used in calibration laboratories for many years and proved to be very effective. This study should make it possible for one to know precisely what is being measured and what system parameters can contribute to measurement inaccuracies. Even though Engen and Beatty [3] have given thorough explanations of precision reflectometers used in measurement systems, there are still some misunderstandings concerning the basic details of tuning procedures."
"Refinements have been made to the parallel-substitution heterodyne method of attenuation measurement. These are provision for small fixed frequency differences between the IF signals to improve the sensitivity of tests for leakage, a switched reference path to reduce errors from drift and to assess \"flange scatter,\" a flexible waveguide in the measuring path to accommodate attenuators of different lengths, a steady flow of dry air through the system to remove moisture, and an electronic system for fine-balancing the two channels."
"An application of the NET-2 network-analysis computer program to the design of a data-acquisition system is described. A successful attempt is made to reduce the system's susceptibility to a cable-excited electromagnetic impulse through semiautomated design of a bandpass filter. Useful attributes of computer programs for such an application are discussed."
"In terms of a total system evaluation, the potential mismatch errors in the evaluation of noise figure or effective input noise temperature are of greater magnitude than is the case in power measurement. In spite of this, this topic has found only limited coverage in the literature. Moreover, the existing treatments are in terms of parameters whose evaluation requires a significant effort. This paper applies a \"terminal invariant\" formulation which provides a deeper physical insight to this problem. It also permits a number of useful conclusions to be drawn with a minimum of additional effort."
"An entirely digital method of measuring angular speed, acceleration, and torque during transient characteristics is described. Diffraction gratings are used in an optical transducer, which is interfaced to a digital computer to process the data obtained and to provide a plot of the transient characteristics as functions of time."
"A system is described which employs two decade sets of local oscillators to separate signal power into a bank of 100 identical filters. By commutating the local oscillators, filter instabilities are removed from the resulting output and local oscillator stability is the remaining factor. Practical limits on this are discussed in relation to the total output uncertainty of the spectrometer."

  "High-frequency switches of the reed relay type have insertion losses of the order of 0.1 dB. The insertion loss is primarily the result of large skin effect impedance in the magnetically active portion of the signal path. This paper presents a novel time-domain reflectometer technique for measuring this skin effect impedance in the time domain then shows how a Fourier transform will convert the readings to either an impedance or insertion loss in the frequency domain. The method uses inexpensive equipment, is very accurate, and is fast since only a single voltage measurement at one instant of time is needed for the determination of the insertion loss at a desired frequency. Precision of at least 0.001 dB is achievable."
"It has been recently recognized that an arbitrary six-port junction, four arms of which are terminated in power meters, can be calibrated to measure the circuit parameters, v, i, z, a, b, Γ, etc., in addition to power. Because this scheme eliminates the need for frequency conversion, it provides a substantially simplified approach to the design of an automatic network analyzer. This paper outlines a calibration procedure for the six-port which is only slightly more complicated than that in use for existing automated measurement systems."
"A pulse comparison technique is described which yields the autocorrelation function and the power spectrum of a repetitive time-domain waveform. The autocorrelation function is realized with a sliding short in a coaxial transmission line to provide time delay; a pyroelectric bolometer to provide multiplication through a square law voltage response; and a capacitor to provide integration. Problems of realization of a perfect time delay and integration limitations are considered, and it is found that noise fluctuations yield the main time resolution limitation that is equivalent to 8 ps for 15-V pulses and a 50-s integration time. The pyroelectric voltage-sensing bolometer is then compared to a pyroelectric capacitance sensing bolometer. It is shown that the capacitance sensing bolometer can handle much longer pulse durations than the voltage sensing bolometer. It is also demonstrated that the sensitivities of the two techniques are equivalent in a typical case at a capacitance sensing bolometer bridge voltage of 3 V. Measurement results of the autocorrelation function and power spectrum, using a voltage sensing pyroelectric bolometer, are given for a nominal 15-V, 500-ps time duration, whose baseband pulses have a 100-pps (pulses per second) repetition rate."
"The measuremnent of transmission characteristics with high precision is indispensable for testing and developing cables and repeaters in submarine cable systems. The precision wide-band transmission measuring system has been developed in Kokusai Denshin Denwa Company, Ltd., and has successfully been applied in both experimental and manufacturing stages. In this system, the insertion loss or the insertion gain of a test piece is measured automaticaly with an accuracy of 0.001 dB, over the range from 0 to 60 dB, in the frequency range from 0.1 to 100 MHz. In this paper, newly developed precision techniques to attain the aforementioned accuracy are described. In addition, the characteristic features of computer controlled techniques that resulted in measurement flexibility and improved the accuracy of the measurement are also presented."
"A computer controlled system for fast and accurate measurements of the TEo11, TEo12 mode attenuations in a helix waveguide over the frequency range of 85-110 GHz is described. Measurement is done by monitoring the change in amplitude of a 10-ns wide pulse propagating inside the helix, as a function of the position of a moving short circuiting piston. Data are acquired and processed by a mini-computer facility. A brief discussion on the generation of the desired waveguide modes and the results of some typical measurements are also given."
"This paper presents an electronic circuit system that is capable of measuringdielectric Q-factor Qx (= 1/tan δ) ranging from 0.01-10 at measuring frequencies 100 kHz-30 MHz, and from 10-105 at 1-300 MHz. For measurement of very high loss materials, a tripartite differential capacitor is used as a variable resistor to substitute for low Rx, and for measurement of very low loss materials, an ordinary differential capacitor connected in series with two fixed deposited fim resistors is used to substitute for high unknown resistance Rx. An important characteristic of the circuit is its capability of measuring capacitance and resistance of high loss materials accurately."
"Recent advances in microwave component measurements using time-domain techniques are described. After reviewing the basic elements of a time-domain system, a substitution procedure is applied to determine the insertion loss of wide-band attenuators. Comparison of these measurements with frequency calibrations shows agreement to within 0.1 dB in 10 dB for attenuators between 10-50 dB, over the frequency range 0.4-8 GHz. Error sources are resolved by experiments designed to isolate and evaluate various contributions including: random errors due to noise and drifts; systematic errors caused by substitution attenuator inaccuracies, line mismatch, deflection nonlinearities, and inaccurate time window widths; time-to-frequency translation errors of aliasing and truncation; and mechanical errors due to connect-disconnect cycles. Results show that random processes are responsible for most of the observed error. The reported measurements establish the calibration capabilities and the expected magnitude of individual system errors for the particular system tested."
"A broadband microwave measurement system has been designed to make complex reflection coefficient measurements on a swept basis at millineter wave frequencies. This instrument covers a frequency range of 50-75 GHz in WR-15 rectangular waveguide. Two appliques are being added in WR-22 and WR-10 waveguide to extend the frequency range of the system to 33-110 GHz. Measurements can be made while sweeping over bands as wide as 10 GHz. An interesting feature of the complex reflection coefficient scanner is that residuals, or baseline, of the system are automatically subtracted. The resultant output display is a real-time polar plot of the actual reflection coefficient of the network under test. Residuals of 0.03 for reflection coefficients around unity, and 0.013 for reflection coefficients around zero can be measured with a resolution of 0.01 while sweeping over a 5 GHz band. A maximum reflection coefficient range of 46 dB has been achieved using straightforward video detection techniques. For measurements of networks with very low reflection coefficients (0.01 and lower) a time averaging feature is available to reduce the effects of random noise. The complex reflection coefficient of the unknown can be displayed on an oscilioscope and photographed, or read out on an X-Y plotter."
"The effects of modulation frequency, RF reference power, and external bias upon the sensitivity and dynamic range of microwave homodyne detection systems was measured for point contact diodes and low l/f noise Schottky and backward diodes. The measurements were made at 4.89 GHz using a signal to noise ratio of 3 dB and a detection system bandwidth of 10 Hz. Maximum sensitivities of -135, -150, and -145 dBm, and dynamic ranges of 92, 110, and 124 dB were measured for the point contact, Schottky, and backward diodes at modulation frequencies of 30, 30, and 3 kHz, respectively. It was found that the level of RF reference signal needed to obtain the maximum sensitivity was equal to or somewhat above the point where the diode changes from square law to linear detection. The results are significant in that previously reported homodyne sensitivities (not necessarily maximum) were on the order of -90 to -130 dBm for point contact diodes and no data are available for Schottky and backward diodes. Significantly improved stability, sensitivity, and dynamic range can be achieved using these low 1/f noise devices, the correct external bias, and the optimum RF reference power."
"This paper describes the design, construction, and performance of an automatic test system for the analog portion of a hybrid computation system. The system, which is capable of carrying out complete dynamic testing of each analog component, uses the digital portion of the hybrid system to provide the desired control with the result that the requirement for sophisticated stimulation and measurement equipment is minimized. The hardware and software of the system are both modular in nature in order to provide versatility and to facilitate modifications and additions as required. The design philosophy is such that the methods used are not limited to a particular analog computer. In fact, they have applications in the testing of many types of electronic equipment."
"Reliable measurement values require constant attention to the performance of the instruments. Great benefits would be achieved if the instruments had built-in fail-safe automatic check procedures. A new principle has been developed for automatic checking and calibration of a digital voltmeter. The entire instrument from the input terminals to the display is included in the check. To check the reference voltage two references are used, and they are automatically compared to each other. For each measurement value the instrument simultaneously checks itself. A simple single ramp voltmeter has been equipped with this self-checking device, and very promising results have been achieved."
"A system of instruments is presented for automated digital measurements of voltage and/or time dependent capacitances. The system has been designed for the evaluation of semiconductor materials and devices. It is based on a fast capacitance-inverse-to-frequency converter (FCFC), where a direct conversion is obtained with high accuracy, and where the device to be tested can be subject to dc, modulated, and pulsed voltage bias. The output frequency (of the order of 1 MHz) accurately foliows capacitance variations, even if occurring in short times (less than 100 Ms). Biasing circuits, a multichannel scaler, and logic interface circuits complete the system. Stationary and nonstationary CV curves and time variations of capacitances can be accuratety measured. The precision can be improved by averagng over many repetitions of the measurement. Derivatives (first and higher orders) of CV curves can also be directly and accurately measured by using a technique based on voltage modulation and synchronous reversible counting. This feature also makes it possible to obtain accurate measurements of doping profiles in semiconductors. Representative experimental results obtained with the system are shown."
"One of the principal considerations in the implementation of automated testing systems is the \"cost\" of accumulating test data. Because testing is controlled and recorded by a digital computer, only discrete data points are gathered. Also, an elapsed waiting time is necessary in order to establish the test conditions prior to performing a measurement. Due to these factors, the number of measurements has a major influence on the cost of testing devices automatically. It now foliows that automated testing of continuous systems will entail interpolation. This paper treats the situation wherein statistical information is substituted for some of the deterministic data in interpolation and extrapolation procedures. The principle advantage with this approach is that a reduction in the number of measurements required to characterize a device through interpolation and extrapolation is achieved. A consequence of utilizing the statistical data is that the device function is said to lie within statistical bounds. In addition to introducing the proposed approach, this paper describes practical considerations in obtaining the required statistical information. A hypothetical example is given in order to illustrate the application of the proposed techniques."
 "The automatic tuning of frequency standards gives a method of removing drifts due to cavity pulling. The paper describes an apparatus designed primarily for tuning the hydrogen maser. The apparatus can also be used for tuning other masers such as the rubidium maser. The system incorporates several of the best features of similar devices previously described in the literature. It includes a digital averager which makes possible the use of a reference oscillator less stable than the maser to be tuned. It includes also a digital integrator, solving the usual problem of offsets in standard integrators. Frequency corrections are made either proportionally or by unit steps through a varactor coupled to the maser cavity. The electronics are made almost entirely with TTL digital integrated circuits (type 7400) for low cost, reliability, and availability. Results on the tuning of rubidium and hydrogen masers are given."
"With the advent of new miniaturized mercury (Hg) switches with reputed transition times of the order of 10 ps, interest has been rekindled in their use in high-peed pulse measurements. Since there is no pretrigger signal available from a Hg switch, normal sequential sampling techniques are not useable to measure the fast Hg switch transition time. For this reason, a new random sampling time base unit was designed to perform these measurements at the low repetition rate of Hg switches. The time base may be used with commercial sampling oscilloscope systems through suitable interconnection terminals or possible interface equipment. It features three selectable time windows of 1 jus, 100 ns, and 10 ns. Using its time magnifier, the fastest sweep rate is 10 ps/cm. A variable trigger lead time control is provided. The trigger sensitivity is 5 mV."
"A dc comparator bridge, which is suitable for measuring resistors from a fraction of an ohm to several megohms with partper-million accuracy or better is described. An analysis of errors which may occur when measuring high-value resistors and methods used for reducing these errors to negligible proportions are included. The bridge can be connected to make either four-terminal or three-terminal measurements. The four-terminal connection is best for measuring low-value resistors. When it was used for measuring high-value resistors, a systematic bridge error was detected, which was found to be primarily due to leakage paths through the insulation, permitting current to bypass one of the measured resistors. This error is avoided by using the three-terminal connection for measuring high-value resistors. The leakage resistance is then in parallel with a low resistance winding rather than one of the measured resistors. The bridge has automatic reversal and a chart recorder output, which continuously indicates the deviation from the set point. The comparator is adjustable in steps of 10-' of full scale, and measurements can be made at ratios up to 11.111/1."
"An impedance meter is described which measures dc resistance and ac capacitance and inductance. It uses an ac-dc ratiometer capable of high accuracy and good noise immunity. The ratiometer is a combination of a dual-slope integrator and an integrating phase-sensitive detector. The ratio, which is displayed on a counter, is the number of denominator signal samples required to offset a prescribed number of numerator samples. The remainder output, if important, can be evaluated by a sinple dual-slope integrator to provide the readout digits of lesser significance. The same circuit is used for both ac and dc ratios and could be used to detennine the ratio of the average value of an ac voltage to a dc voltge."
"The design of a stable sine-wave source for error determination of ac-measuring instruments is discussed. The electronic amplitude control circuit has been constructed using standard integrated circuits. The fluctuations of its rms output voltage, observed over the period of 1 h, are 1 · 10-6 peak-to-peak. Since the total harmonic distortion is less than 1 · 10-3, its contribution to the error of the rms value may be neglected."
"A new method has been developed for measuring the power on high-voltage lines. It involves determining the power directly on the high-voltage line and transmitting the measured values to the ground potential side by the aid of infrared light pulses. Two electromechanical counters at ground side, one for each direction of energy flow, record the transported electrical energy. The measuring error of the device is of the order of 0.2 percent. The small number of active electronic components should result in satisfactory reliability."
"An independent system to pinpoint buried equipment to depths of 10 ft has been developed. Its primary use will be rapid, accurate, and unambiguous location of underground utility services and survey points. The system has two components-a passive marker buried at a point of interest, and a hand-carried electronic interrogator. The marker, which is packaged as a sturdy peg, collects and reradiates low frequency energy when simulated by an interrogator. The peg design enhances pick-up range and location accuracy, and allows user identification by frequency. The interrogator is a sequentially switched transmitter-receiver that generates precise energy bursts and detects returned signals; optimum processing by frequency selection and cross correlation is used. The design of both components acknowledges an abusive field operating environment. Interrogator physical and operational details received particular emphasis, resulting in a simple functional instrument of unconventional shape."
"A method in which use is made of a multichannel analyzer to measure the distribution of the corona pulse heights of insulating systems of various electrical apparatus such as transformers, capacitors, and cables is described. Suitable pulse-shaping circuitry is used in conjunction with an RCL-type corona pulse detector to provide a basic sensitivity level of 1 pC and corona pulse resolution limit of about 10-15 ,μ s. A calibration technique is described and particular attention is given to the interpretation of calibration results obtained under high ambient noise conditions normally prevalent in electrical apparatus production areas. It is shown that electrical interference may degrade the corona charge resolution of the analyzer display to as much as 4.0 pC as compared to the half-peak width value of about 0.5 pC in the near absence of noise. Typical corona pulse-height distribution spectra obtained on solid dielectric insulated power cables are presented."
"A compressed gas capacitor now in use at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) changes capacitance by less than 2 parts per million from 0-300 kV. This extremely small variation results primarily from rugged construction, and thus requires only reasonably careful centering of its three cylindrical electrodes. It has a hollow cantilevered high-voltage electrode suspended between an outer 100-pF low-voltage electrode and a segmented inner low-voltage electrode having values of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 10 pF, or any parallel combination thereof. The capacitor's small voltage dependence was inferred from the following independent measurements: 1) comparison with another high-voltage capacitor having a small experimentally determined coefficient; 2) comparison of the inner and outer sections with each other; and 3) measurement of capacitance change resulting from application of known forces on the cantilevered electrodes, and correlating this with calculated high-voltage electrostatic forces. The capacitor is used in determining the voltage coefficients of NBS-owned commercial standard capacitors; in the calibration of customers' standard capacitors, voltage transformers, and dividers to 200 kV and above; and in research on coupling capacitor voltage transformers and other high-voltage devices and materials."
"For power loss measurements in large line shunt reactors, often characterized by loss tangents (or power factors) approaching 10-3, a non-frequency-sensitive bridge is required if accuracies approaching ±1.0 percent are to be realized. Unless the bridge balance is unaffected by the very small, but unavoidable, frequency shifts present in commercial power systems, sufficient balance resolution for this accuracy is difficult to obtain. This paper describes a non-frequency-sensitive bridge network which is direct reading in terms of conductance and susceptance of the reactor under test. Use is made of operational amplifiers to help shape the desired frequency characteristic. Resolutions approaching one part in 106 can be realized. Also described are means and procedures for calibrating the bridge in terms of a simulated \"standard\" reactor which can have either zero loss or a predetermined positive or negative loss."

   "Laser-driven fusion, although requiring the use of an unusual source of pulsed energy, depends in its main features on well known and verified results of hydrodynamics and nuclear physics. Under optimized conditions these allow energy breakeven by the fusion process to occur under conditions which appear to be well within the range of present technology. Achieving the energy multiplication required for practical application is expected to be more difficult but not infeasible within short-range projections of the development of laser technology. The feasibility of laser-driven fusion power plants appears to rest more on pellet and laser ecomonics than on reactor technology. The study of these problems is underway and will certainly be greatly intensified as the prediction of the basic processes is experimentally confirmed."
"This paper considers a new kind of M.H.D. generator operating at extremely low temperature through the use of a working fluid which is either water vapor or metallic vapors. In the first case conductivity is achieved by seeding with electrolytes. A high thermodynamical efficiency is obtained by combination of an adiabatic expansion with an isothermal compression."
 "Ions with Maxwellian energy distributions and kinetic temperatures up to seven keV have been observed in a modified Penning discharge. Investigation of the plasma revealed two distinct spoke-like concentrations of charge, consisting respectively of ions and electrons, rotating with different velocities in the sheath between the plasma and the anode ring. Theoretical expressions are derived for the frequency of the ion and electron spoke rotation, for the ion kinetic temperature resulting from the ion spoke velocity, and for the ion heating efficiency. An extensive series of experimental measurements were made to check these theoretical expressions, and approximate agreement was obtained. It is shown that the ion kinetic temperature in the modified Penning discharge scales according to the relation Vi ~ Vani1/4/B1/2 where Va is the applied anode voltage, ni is the ion density in the sheath, and B is the magnetic field strength. The observed data demonstrate that the ion heating efficiency can be as high as several tens of percent."
"The dispersion relation of longitudinal electron-plasma oscillation for a fully ionized plasma with equal electron and ion temperatures in the absence of an external magnetic field has been calculated by taking into account of both the electron-ion and electron-electron collisions. The calculation utilizes the absorptive parts of the collisional conductivity functions derived by DuBois and coworkers for obtaining the polarizability parts via Kramers-Kronig relation. The results are presented in graphical forms and show that the longitudinal plasma oscillations are shifted toward higher frequencies from the resonance of collisionless plasma predicted by the Bohm-Gross dispersion relation."
"Breakdown electric field strengths have been measured in four S-band cavities filled with high purity SF6 at room temperature in the approximate pressure range from 0.01 to 200 Torr. Measurements were made for submicrosecond effective pulse widths under essentially `single pulse' conditions, and also under conditions equivalent to continuous wave breakdown. The results are used to calculate an average elastic collision frequency of vc = 1.0 × 1010p sec-1."

 "Past efforts at modeling laminar, cascade arc behavior are reviewed. The models are delineated in terms of their inherent restrictions and are compared on the basis of ease of application, as well as ability to provide useful engineering information and important physical insights. It is concluded that, although approximate analytical models have suggested important trends, they have almost universally failed to accurately quantify arc behavior. The most successful procedures have been those which use finite-difference methods for the solution of a comprehensive set of flow equations. Greatest success is derived from the use of a multi-fluid model which accounts for arc thermochemical nonequilibrium effects."
"The thermal, flow and electrical conditions are presented for the downstream portion of an argon arc with local fluid constriction. The arc is initially wall-stabilized in a 10 mm diameter water-cooled constrictor and at some point after flow becomes fully developed the arc is constricted by a radial inward jet. The redevelopment of the flow downstream of the injection slot is investigated by measurements of the pressure drop, wall heat flux and electric field. It is observed that redevelopment proceeds roughly as predicted by classical theory. Measurements of the electric field indicate that the region of maximum constriction is limited in extent."
"The constrictor wall heat flux characteristics of a high intensity argon arc with a transpiration cooled constrictor are discussed. An apparatus utilizing a segmented plenum chamber is described which provides in contrast to previous experiments more uniform constrictor wall temperatures. This permits lower total transpirant mass flow rates so that laminar flow within the constrictor tube can be maintained. A significant amount of data agrees with the theoretical prediction that the heat flux to the constrictor wall decreases with increasing transpirant mass flux. Data are presented referring to the total energy distribution for the device and the modes of dissipation of heat from the constrictor wall. The effects of turbulence are shown to influence the heat flux to the constrictor, the electric field strength, and the temperature distribution in the arc column."
"Some results of an approximate similarity approach are presented applied to electric arc discharges and the underlying basic criteria are delineated. It is shown that the most important process may be specified for each type of discharge from which arc parameters mainly depend on. In addition to the main process, a number of other processes are also involved which exert a weaker influence on the arc parameters. Taking these processes also into account permits a more precise derivation of generalized relations."
"Through the specification of two independent variables (e. g., arc current and mainstream velocity), and using appropriate phenomenological relations, the flow fields, temperature fields, and arc boundary shapes of magnetically balanced cross-flow arcs have been determined. Flow through the arc occurs at lower Reynolds numbers, Reo ~ 1; at higher Reynolds numbers a dividing streamline is formed, inside of which double vortex flow is found. Isotherms are nearly circular for the case of flow through the arc. At the higher Reynolds numbers the isotherms are non-circular throughout the cross-section with major axis transverse to the direction of flow."
"Deviations from rotational symmetry of arc columns exposed to transverse magnetic fields cause convection and a momentum transport between the column and its surrounding gas. As a consequence, the arc moves and changes its geometry until it reaches a stable configuration. Based on the momentum transport equation, the arc behavior is discussed under various operating conditions, and stable arc configurations are determined. In particular, the stability-criteria of a balanced arc column in a transverse gas flow and magnetic field is derived. It turns out that the arc becomes unstable with respect to kinks parallel to the applied magnetic field when ß = p∞/(B2/8TT)≤1. (p∞ = ambient pressure, Bo = applied magnetic field)."
"The first part of the paper gives a survey of some theoretical aspects of the behavior of a free burning arc in transverse cross-flow and magnetic field. After a short discussion of the variety of forces acting on the arc, the low current case is investigated, in which the external magnetic field is assumed to change aperiodically with time. In the second part, an arc experiment is described which allows the examination of the theoretical aspects of the arc motion. As a diagnostic method, a holographic technique is applied which visualizes the position of the arc as function of time. The calculated and measured displacements of the arc agree within the error limits."
"Experiments are reported which allow the determination of retrograde velocity of individual cathode spots and of the plasma flow in a pulsed discharge using various metals and carbon as cathode materials. For discharge currents from 10 to 40 amps, pressures of 3 mmHg and magnetic field strengths of 6.103G retrograde spot velocities from 30 to approximately 300 m/sec are observed and the corresponding plasma flow velocities are in the range from 4,400 to 8,600 m/sec. On cathode materials with low melting points, the splitting rate of spots and the motion of individual spots is small, whereas under identical conditions the spots on refractory materials are highly mobile, the splitting rate is large, and the lifetime of individual spots is short."
"A DC electric arc is operated in argon at pressures between 100 and 760 mm Hg, axial flow velocities from 0 to 100 m/sec, and currents from 50 to 200 amps to assess the influence of these parameters on anode heat transfer using a double-anode configuration consisting of two plane, parallel anodes. Since the anode arc attachment size is appreciably smaller than the anode surface area in these experiments, a method is developed using an optical and/or floating potential probes for measuring the size of the near-anode arc column. The relative variation of two perpendicular dimensions of the near-anode arc column for variation in the arc operating parameters (pressure, flow velocity, current, anode separation) are measured. The results reveal that the cross section of the nearanode column is not circular and the average local heat fluxes show a strong dependence on the gas pressure."
"This paper deals with the problem of ignition to the porous transpiration cooled anode of an arc in 1 atm. argon. This was observed for both porous graphite and sintered porous tungsten anodes, in the latter case causing melt spots to form which limited the useful life of the anode. A study was undertaken to overcome this problem in which the transient behavior of the arc current, voltage, anode surface area coverage and gas flow rate of transpiration gas was observed by high speed electronics and cinematography during the ignition period. From these data a computation of the anode current density vs. time showed abnormally high values during the first second or two following ignition; e.g. 1000 amps/cm2 averaged over the first second for a steady state arc current of 70 amps. The damage was attributed to excessive thermal loading during the arc growth period and eliminated by means of a properly control led ignition sequence."
"Experimental measurements of a radial coaxial gaseous discharge were made using an adjustable Langmuir probe and a microwave interferometer. Excellent agreement of these results is observed when inhomogeneities of both the electron number density and temperature are accounted for and the electronneutral collisions are assumed to be \"hard-sphere\" collisions."
"The scope of this research is to investigate experimentally electron (ne), negative ion (n-) and positive ion (n+) densities characterizing laboratory negative ion-rich plasmas, produced by electron attachment in N2O3, O2 and I2, and to find out the factors limiting the achievement of very low ß (relative electron density ß = ne/n+). These plasmas may be of great interest for the production of negative ion beams. It is shown experimentally that it is possible to produce plasmas with a high proportion of negative ions (n-/n+ ≥ 90 %) and a low proportion of electrons, at densities n+ up to 1011 cm-3. The comparison of mass spectrometric data with kinetic calculations leads to the conclusion that the loss of negative ions by diffusion limits the lowest ß achieved at low ion density (n+ < 109 cm-3). At higher ion density, mutual neutralization seems to control the ß values. A general limitation seems to exist for the lowest ß attainable in small plasmas produced by electron attachment : the confinement of negative ions in a plasma is due to the presence of electrons and therefore this confinement becomes inefficient when ß drops to values as low as 10-3."
"The radiation patterns of a longitudinal electron plasma wave excited in a warm unbounded plasma by a grid and parallel plane grids and the reception patterns for wire antennas and the grid having a grounded plate were measured experimentally. The results agreed well with theoretically predicted radiation patterns based on a fluid model description for electrons. The dependence of the received amplitude of a gridded parallel plate on the D. C. potential of the antenna was studied. The possibility of estimating the wavelength from measured amplitudes of the wire antenna and the gridded parallel plate is also discussed."
"The MHD generator is presently recognized as one of the more promising new methods of thermal to electric energy conversion and is presently being developed for this purpose, primarily with fossil fuels in mind as the source of heat. However, this \"conventional\" type of MHD, which uses a \"plasma\" having greater similarity to the combustion gas in a conventional furnace than to the cloud of kilovolt particles in the core of a fusion reactor, never-the-less offers a relatively straightforward but efficient method of converting into electric power the heat released by the fusion reaction."
"The particles making up a plasma are usually not in equilibrium, and their energies are often relativistic and anisotropically distributed, especially if the plasma is in a d.c. magnetic field. Thus, the usual methods for developing particle distribution functions based on equilibrium conditions are not applicable. A development of a particular anisotropic relativistic distribution function that may describe the particles in a plasma is made."

 "Steady, motionless cascaded N2-arcs with tube diameters of 2, 3, and 5 mm are investigated at atmospheric pressure to gain insight into the radiative energy transport for temperatures up to 27,000 K. From the electrical characteristics, the total emitted radiation, and the temperature distributions, the electrical conductivity and the transparent emission are evaluated. It is shown that transparent emission can be neglected in the energy transport of nitrogen. The thermal conductivity and the radiative balance as the difference between total emission and absorption per unit volume are determined by introducing the concept of a zero radius arc. Extrapolation to the zero radius arc also permits the determination of the total emission alone. The emission and reabsorption of radiation plays a decisive role in the energy transport for temperatures above 13,000 K."
"The lowering of the ionization potentials of hydrogen and carbon atoms immersed in a high temperature and high density thermal plasma generated in a wall stabilized arc have been estimated from the advance or shift of their respective series limits in the vacuum ultraviolet region of the spectrum for different electron densities and temperatures. Results show a close agreement with those theoretical calculations in which the effects of both microfield and polarization terms are added. However, our electron densities are lower by about two orders of magnitude than the critical electron densities required by theory for the inclusion of the microfield term. The question of validity of a critical electrom density will be discussed."
"Results of spectroscopic investigations on high pressure argon arcs are presented. The experimental investigations were performed on cascade arcs at pressure levels up to 250 atm. Measurements of the radial temperature distribution as well as of the width and shift of selected spectral lines were performed. Results concerning the AI 4300 line are presented. A comparison with theoretical values shows fair agreement."
"The thermostatic states of a 100 amp, 1.016 bar, free-burning helium short arc with a 10 mm electrode gap are mapped from spectroscopic measurements at eight cross sections. The theoretical model used is a multifluids model extended to consider nonequilibrium between electron and excitation temperatures, as well as simple nonequilibrium among excited electronic levels. Seven helium lines are used to determine population densities and upper level excitation temperatures. The electron density is calculated from continuum intensity measurements at C4690. Electron temperatures are found from an astrophysical method suggested by Athay and Menzel. The effective total excitation temperature is obtained by iteration using the multifluids model. The results indicate total excitation temperature values close to the usually calculated \"LTE\" temperatures, but electron temperatures up to three times larger than the total excitation temperature on the arc centerline near the electrodes. The ratio is approximately 1.5 in the middle of the arc. The heavy particle kinetic temperatures appear to follow the electron temperature, except near the anode, where they drop to values smaller than the total excitation temperatures."
"A brief account is given of ideas which are aimed at providing a common reference point for theoretical treatments of arc problems through the equations of continuum magne-to-fluid-dynamics. By unifying theoretical solutions in the manner described, their usefulness in analyzing the results of experimental investigations may be greatly enhanced. The ideas center on the concept of an isothermal arc periphery, the temperature of which is regarded as an artificial gas property to be derived from the measured voltage gradient-current characteristic of a wall-stabilized arc of low power gradient. Evidence in support of this concept is given for various types of arc in nitrogen at one atmosphere pressure. Some of the implications of the use of an effective periphery of a high pressure arc are examined, and a suggestion is made for the complete set of boundary conditions to be applied at the periphery."
"The transient flow generated by a pulsed, megawatt-level, gas-fed arc with an applied magnetic nozzle has been examined with a new design piezoelectric pressure transducer. Sensor thermal conduction and accelerations have been examined and eliminated in the 500μsec period of plasma flow. Existence of a large magnitude cold gas pressure front of 20μsec duration has been reconfirmed and its relationship to the following plasma flow of about 200μsec duration has been examined for the first time. At a point 30 cm from the arc source, initially near vacuum conditions (typically with an arc current of 11.2 kA and 1 tesla applied magnetic field), a pressure pulse of unionized gas with a magnitude of 104 N/m2 is followed by plasma flows with nearly constant impact pressure of 103 N/m2. Pressure and number density in this plasma region are seen to decrease with applied magnetic field strength. With electron density derived from Thomson scattering measurements (1020 m-3) plasma flow velocities on the order of 5 × 104 m/sec are calculated."
"For toroidal arc plasmas, the geometrical configuration, material and thickness of the discharge tube are of special importance not only for the cooling problem but also for the thermal and magnetogasdynamic behavior. In this paper, we present a new method for calculating the electromagnetic and dynamic quantities of a toroidal plasma, including the thermal properties of the confining arc wall. Results are given for a d. c. arc burning in a torus segment. The toroidal walls are made from quartz--or copper--segments with thin electrically isolating layers."
"The object of this study is to analytically determine the properties of an arc discharge generated by a combination of induction and d. c. electromagnetic fields. Induction power is supplied to the discharge by a solenoidal coil whose axis of symmetry is aligned with the applied d. c. electric field. A numerical technique is used to simultaneously solve a set of linear differential equations which include Maxwell's field equations, the single fluid energy equation, the momentum balance equation, Ohm's law, and the radiation diffusion equation. It is necessary to make a number of reasonable assumptions to obtain the final set of equations for programming. These assumptions restrict the calculations to azimuthally symmetric plasmas with axial gradients only in static pressure. In addition, the radiant energy flux is assumed to be isotropic within the plasma."
"An energy balance analysis has been performed for a confined cylindrical arc column heated inductively by high-frequency fields. The analysis includes the convective energy transport due to a radial inflow in addition to the radiative and conductive transport considered in the Ellenbaas-Heller equation. The resulting non-linear, two-point boundary value equations were solved numerically. Calculations were performed for an argon arc operating at atmospheric pressure using experimentally determined transport properties. Temperature profiles were found to be in better agreement with measured values, when radial inflow was included. There was no indication that the arc attained some natural diameter based on a specific plasma radius to skin depth ratio."
"Results from a computational study of the efficiency of a direct energy recovery system are presented. This system is similar to R. F. Post's original (gridless) periodic-focus system. However, the computer code used here allows more flexibility than that used by Post. His code requires analytic expressions for the potentials; this code requires only the values of potential on the boundaries. Consequently, the code can be applied to systems where analytic expressions have not been written for the potential. The incident beam used in this study had an average thickness of 0.42 m (as might be expected in an ideal reactor situation) and a maximum divergence angle of ±3.3°. Each of the systems tested, when operating at optimum efficiency, recovered 80% of the energy, as compared to 91% for Post's gridded periodic system."
"A perturbation expansion for the electrostatic potential of a uniformly charged, dielectric sphere is extended to include asymmetrical electrolytes in the large radius limit. The potential, valid for qϕ/>T > 1 and small λD/a near the sphere, is solved in a similar manner to that for 1-1 electrolytes."
"We have studied fully-relativistic, self-consistent theoretical equilibria for the electron sheath near a magnetically insulated cathode. Such equilibria exist at stresses of 3 MV/cm for applied magnetic fields of ≥13 kG and at stresses of 5 MV/cm for applied magnetic fields of ≥20 kG in an 0.5 cm gap. The equilibrium solutions are obtained analytically as elliptic integrals, which are then evaluated numerically for special cases of interest to obtain quantitative results for the breakdown stress at various field levels."

 "This paper examines one basic process causing the d. c. high voltage breakdown of a gas. Specifically, it contains a modified criterion for the transition of a Townsend Avalanche to a Streamer Discharge. Instead of the assumption that the electrons in the avalanche are spread laterally by multiple scattering on gas molecules (thermal diffusion), the assumption used is that the electrons are spread solely by mutual electrostatic repulsion. A criterion is found that yields quantitative results comparable to those obtained using the \"multiple scattering\" assumption. This modified criterion is probably most useful where \"multiple scattering\" is improbable - where an electron loses almost all of its energy on colliding with complex gas molecules. In addition, the classical (thermal-diffusion-dominated) breakdown criterion is re-derived in a much simpler form."
"An experimental technique is described which allows one to easily measure and rapidly display the particle distribution function in phase-space in nonlinear wave-plasma interaction experiments. An application to the study of Pseudowaves is also presented."
 "The principles of initiating fusion by lasers and high-energy laser system technology are reviewed. Nonlinear optical propagation at high intensities in laser amplifiers is described and is related to the system requirements for a laser used to produce fusion."
"The dispersion relation for the ion-ion hybrid resonance has been investigated in the density region of 106 cm-3 to 1017 cm-3 with the parallel wave number as the parameter, and the accessibility condition is presented."
"Solution of Maxwell's equations for a cold, uniform magnetoplasma bounded by conducting walls shows (i) how plane waves evolve in the space of (&#x003C9;/&#x003C9;<sub>c</sub>,&#x003C9;<sub>p</sub>/&#x003V9;<sub>c</sub>) with (kc/&#x003C9;<sub>c</sub>) as parameter, and (ii) the range of parameters in which whistler mode propagation without Wieder's fine structure<sup>2</sup> can be expected. In this space, the whistler evolves from an electrostatic mode at low densities, the whistler characteristic appears in a range of densities where the static approximation is invalid, and at still higher densities, residual effects of boundaries show up in the fine structure, as accounted for by J. C. Lee<sup>5</sup>. The asymptotic form of the solution when lateral dimensions are large shows the existence of classes of solutions which are inadmissible because none can be reached along a continuous locus in this space. Effects of finite boundaries on the dispersion characteristic and the interpretation of experimental data are discussed."
"The low frequency cross spectrum of electron density fluctuations in a weakly ionized magnetoplasma is measured with two Langmuir probes aligned transverse to the static magnetic field. The shapes of the observed cross spectra are exponentionally damped cosines as predicted by theory. However, the frequency of the first zero crossing of the cross spectra is strongly dependent on probe bias."

 "The current status of semiconductor device laboratories, both here and abroad, is examined for objectives, method, cost and operation. The bulk of the paper presents results of a survey of 33 universities in North and South America, Europe and Asia. Arguments are presented for and against incorporating such a laboratory into the general Electrical Engineering curriculum."
"This paper shows how the basic idea of the adjoint method can be taught to juniors using only sinusoidal steady-state analysis, Cramer's rule, a few matrix transpositions and the relation between node-admittance matrix and branch-admittance matrix."
"Ionization phenomena will continue to occur in a growing variety of critical situations in electric power systems, and some understanding of this area is therefore required in many power engineering positions. The inductive educational technique, in which basic principles are developed from study of specific examples, is presented as a favorable method for covering this material in modern electrical engineering curricula. To achieve this objective, a course is suggested which includes five interrelated parts: introduction of the several specific examples which will be treated, preliminary consideration of some underlying physical principles, intensive study of the examples, laboratory exercises, and term reports."
"A classroom demonstration has been developed which allows the correlation functions of a wide variety of pre-selected signals to be displayed on an oscilloscope. The demonstration utilizes standard equipment found in most undergraduate electrical engineering laboratories and requires no special construction of new equipment or extensive modification of existing instruments. All the steps involved in generating a given correlation function can be displayed in a logical step-by-step sequence from the input signals to the output function. Either autocorrelation or cross-correlation can be performed and the effects of varying different parameters illustrated. Additionally the same two signals can be convolved so that the validity of the superposition integral can be demonstrated. The application of correlation techniques to the detection of signals in the presence of noise can also be demonstrated. Examples of all these possibilities are given."
"The wave equation may be treated in a course required of all engineering students. To aid understanding, it is desirable that a variety of \"pictures\" of wave motion be available. We describe the results of a computer program that generates pictures of a vibrating string for a variety of initial conditions, and discuss how these may be used in class discussion."
"This paper describes the design laboratory associated with a course in instrumentation transducers. Students are given the requirements for an instrument, and suggestions for a method of design. They must select component values, assemble the instrument, and test its performance. This approach encourages the student to perform synthesis, rather than analysis, yet also ensures that he will master a core of knowledge. The goals of the laboratory are to increase the student's ability to perform electronic design and to increase the student's knowledge of a variety of transducers. Student evaluation indicates that these senior electrical engineers over-whelmingly favor this type of lab."
"The paper opens with a review of the general background to engineering education in the United Kingdom, commenting on some effects of social ideas on educational institutions and their curricula. A review is made of the recent and present situations in the secondary schools, with special attention being given to the curriculum of those who subsequently continue their studies full-time in universities and colleges. The curricula in these latter institutions is then reviewed and some of the teaching problems are outlined. The paper concludes with some speculation about future trends."
"It seems inevitable that large scale systems for delivering instruction to remote locations will soon be a feature in many universities. Questions are certain to be raised about the quality of the instruction such systems can provide. The contexts and the \"hidden curricula\" for remote instruction must differ from those for instruction on campus. A number of such factors are discussed, and the need for prompt and systematic research into these factors is emphasized."
"One of the problems in effectively teaching a course in signal and system theory is the difficulty of performing the mathematical operations involved in the application of theory to meaningful problems. In theory, the Fourier transform, convolution and correlation operations usually are readily grasped by the student but the application often proves to be difficult. Performing the integral operations requires painstaking care to get proper limits on the integrals, displacing functions properly, etc. It seems that the student gains little insight to the problem under analysis by these manipulations. Typically, only the simplest type of functions are handled by this analytic approach. This paper describes the Signal Analysis Program, a computer utility which employs the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm and is designed to relieve the user from time consuming and tedious calculations. Classes of problems and signal functions, previously deemed too complicated to treat in an undergraduate course, require little more concern than the simplest of problems. The effectiveness and applicability of this utility has been demonstrated by students applying it to many other areas where it is not a course requirement."
"Four student engineering projects that were designed and carried out by sophomore electrical engineering students at Texas A. & M. University are described and discussed. The projects were done outside of the regular class schedule and were not required or given credit."
"SYSTEM is a program which is developed for the analysis of lumped nonlinear systems. This package consists of about 700 Fortran IV statements and requires approximately 50 kbytes of memory on an IBM 360/75 computer. The low memory requirements of this versatile program compared to other well known programs makes it especially useful for student use. Its highly modular structure enables the users to experiment with several formulation and solution procedures. SYSTEM also provides sensitivity response for parameter variations, a feature highly desirable for automated design of systems."
"Examples are presented illustrating graphically the envelope distortion inherent to SSB signals and the dependence of this distortion upon the amount of carrier present with the sideband."
"The equivalence between a periodic function and an infinite series of sinusoids is developed by termwise inversion of the partial fraction expansion of the Laplace transform of the periodic function."
"In an effort to obtain some data as to the adequacy of social-humanistic courses in the engineering curricula, a test on current events was given to all senior engineers and a random sample of Liberal Arts seniors at The Pennsylvania State University. The average score made by the Liberal Arts seniors was 2.2 points higher than the engineers out of a possible 105. A covariance of analysis indicated that the odds were only 8 to 1 that the results were not due to pure chance. Most educational psychologists would say there was no significant difference since the odds in favor of the Liberal Arts majors were less than 1 in 20. Although the knowledge of current events is not synonymous with knowledge of the social-humanities, it appears that the current program is satisfactory."
"There are some 3 million handicapped persons living in the United States. Can the engineer help these people lead more normal lives? This paper describes some of the solutions obtained by engineering students at Tufts University working under the direction of the author and in collaboration with the Tufts Rehabilitation Institute. Special purpose hardware is described which enables a severely paralyzed person to perform otherwise difficult or impossible tasks. In particular a dynamic hand splint and a 15 channel ON-OFF controller controlled by a unique skin deflection transducer are discussed. Of course, these units provide only a partial solution to the problems of the handicapped. Much remains to be done and colleagues are encouraged to include problems in this area in their design curricula."
"The purpose of this study is to determine whether the professor who gives higher grades receives, in general, higher ratings by students. In this study grades given by 109 instructors in the College of Engineering during the last three years were compared with student ratings. Correlation between the score received by the instructor in a recent student opinion survey and the percentages of letter grades, or combinations of letter grades, assigned by the instructor, has been calculated. No significant correlation has been found. The highest correlation found was between the survey score and the percentage of the sum of A, B, C, and D grades minus the percentage of F grades assigned. The correlation coefficient here was calculated to be 18.3%."

 "Considering continuing education in its broadest sense, the IEEE has provided a wide variety of learning experiences since its founding in 1884. Indeed, the type and number of offerings has become so diffuse as to cause a \"masking\" effect to develop conceming its educational role over the years. While continuing to provide a plethora of educational material, the IEEE in recent years has attempted to focus on specific tutorial material directed at its individual member audience as well as its geographic units, utilizing the most effective media at its disposal. The programs currently underway are described and some thoughts on the directions the Institute might go in the future are discussed."
"Engineering societies such as the IEEE have long held a close concern for, and have had a formal impact on engineering education. Only recently, however, have societies taken a programming interest in continuing professional education. The continuing education interests of engineers generally are represented in the Continuing Engineering Studies Division of the American Society for Engineering Education. This organization is continuously seeking ways to offer better programs to more engineers, at locations and times convenient to the working engineer, and at reasonable cost. The inter-relationship of the engineering societies, educational associations and universities and colleges in continuing engineering education is discussed. An example of an integrally cooperative program, the \"Professional Certificate Program,\" now under development at UCLA, is described in detail."
"The Professional Development Degree adds a new dimension to continuing education possibilities for graduate engineers. It is a program developed for the purpose of allowing individual engineers to take better advantage of the wide variety of available educational opportunities by deliberately reducing the obstacles between him and those opportunities. The program is discussed from the viewpoint of these obstacles and the ideas and concepts introduced to minimize them."
"Several types of commercial organizations play significant roles in the continuing education of engineers and other professional personnel, supplementing the efforts of individuals, employers, professional societies and universities. In addition to the publication of textbooks and technical magazines, entrepreneurs are discovering new opportunities in the production and distribution of multi-media \"packaged\" courses. The recent trends toward external degrees and separation of the testing and certification process from the instructional process may enhance the significance of learning opportunities made available through commercial channels."
"The role of a proprietary school like McGraw-Hill will be defined as a purveyor of education in electronics engineering by means of home study. The advantages of home study education with respect to a student having the choice of studying when he wants to, where he wants to, and at what rate will be described. The history of U. S. home study education and its viability when compared in a research sense with traditional residence instruction will be traced. And lastly, the future role of home study in electronics engineering will be predicted. As one futuristic step, a current affiliation between a proprietary school and an accredited university, as a progressive step in providing a path by which a student can earn an associate or baccalaureate degree in electronics, will be described in detail."
"One of the most often overlooked opportunities for improving the profitability of a manufacturing business is the development of the professional (exempt) personnel assigned to the manufacturing function. Decisions made in manufacturing, many at relatively low levels in the organizational hierarchy, will often appear to be routine but in reality have substantial impact on the present and future status of the business. It is not uncommon for the manufacturing function to account for two-thirds of the employment of a company, and to spend in labor, material, and overhead an amount equal to 60-70% of the net sales billed. The implications with respect to having highly competent manpower in place are obvious- and enormous. It is the performance of professional work force interfacing with engineering design on the one hand and shop labor on the other which determines how effectively this money is spent in achieving the goals of the business. At higher levels in the manufacturing function, there are a variety of education opportunities-short courses, seminars, graduate courses, workshops-to serve the continuing needs. The assumption is that the base building stages of individual competency have been completed and very specific needs can be identified and accommodated. Such is not the case at the middle and lower regions of the population."
"The problem is to identify the existing and prospective components and systems of instructional media in order to match the needs of continuing education. A general statement of need relative to continuing studies in engineering education was expressed four years ago in the Journal of Engineering Education (58: 367-446, 1968). It was recommended that increased attention be paid to strengthening functional relationships between continuing education and the programs of engineering schools, industry, government and the engineering societies. The present paper attempts to describe in general terms the appropriateness of specific kinds of instructional media to the particular needs of engineering education, whether primary or continuing. For purposes of discussion \"instructional media\" is defined to mean all equipment and materials traditionally called \"audiovisual materials\" and all of the newer media such as television, overhead projectuals, programmed materials and any form of computer-assisted or computer-mediated instruction. Efficient and effective communication requires an appropriate match between medium and message. This necessarily means a sophisticated understanding of the educational needs, the nature of the information to be communicated and the functional capability of the various educational media."
"Television has recently been very successfully applied to Engineering Extended Learning. This paper will review the use of this medium by the University of Florida, Colorado State University, Stanford University and the University of California, Davis Campus. Factors examined in the paper are: 1. Extent and type of system 2. Need served 3. Number and type of students 4. Cost of system a. total per student served b. cost to student 5. Results and reaction to the system The paper particularly emphasizes the University of California system and includes a report on the results of the first year of operation of a singularly successful system for bringing graduate education to the full time working engineer at reasonable cost and high quality."
"The Continuing Engineering Education program at George Washington University has a somewhat unique audience;60% from government,40% from industry;60% from local area,40% from national and international sources. Although the present program has been shaped by the desires of this audience, it is now changing in accord with the maturing of Continuing Education studies in the United States. Plans are being devised for the awarding of certiflcates for the accumulation of a certain number of Continuing Education Units in related subjects, recognizing courses taken at other universities. In the long range, an optimum solution would be to use professional educators to advise individual employees of a company or agency on a comprehensive program of study. Incentives and deterrents to participation in Continuing Engineering studies are being analyzed to determine the optimum mix of courses and seminars. The University has worked with some federal government agencies to devise and present updating courses for their particular personnel who have similar backgrounds and needs."
"In providing continuing education opportunities for its engineering-oriented employees, industry today has five distinct options. These are: (a) Instructional television of campus course offerings into the plant, (b) Contract courses tailored to the company's specific requirements, (c) Engineering short courses of the summer variety, (d) In-plant offerings by company staff augmented by other professionals, (e) Traditional on-campus work through night school or released time. These options can be viewed from the standpoint of the popular value concept, \"benefit: cost\" ratio. Influencing factors are the role of credit, company expectations, employee expectations, direct and indirect costs to the company and to the individual, quality of course offerings, the atmosphere for continuing engineering education today and the nature of the company's involvement in technologically advanced work. Conclusions are given regarding the \"best\" solution for a given situation. Recommendations are made for enhancement of the continuing education responsibilities of participants."
"For the past 4 years, the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) has conducted a program for training unskilled personnel into technical fields at the technician level. In common with many such programs, the SLAC effort is divided into two parts: 1) on-the-job practical experience, and 2) correlated academic studies. The SLAC approach to the second part, academic studies, is somewhat unique. SLAC has entered into an arrangement with the local community colleges whereby the courses taken by the students are those which lead toward an AA degree at those colleges. Courses are taught at SLAC by professional employees who have been accredited in the State Junior College system. The courses follow the outline and standards set up by the particular department within the community college itself. Thus the student learns not only those subjects of interest to SLAC, but those which will satisfy the college technical program requirements for an AA degree. The practical aspects of this program, along with some of the history and results, are discussed."
"The subject of Continuing Professional Education has received much attention recently, largely because of the current crisis in engineering unemployment. IEEE local and national management, in response to IEEE member interest, is searching for methods of implementing meaningful continuing education programs in a variety of practical situations. This paper attempts to identify some of the basic problems of engineering obsolescence, and to visualize the role of continuing engineering education as a countermeasure. It is suggested that IEEE members and local chapters themselves have an important role to fill in continuing education. A particular proposal for a program for Nuclear Science is described."

 "This paper describes that portion of an undergraduate laboratory course in which the layout of an active, thick film hybrid circuit is designed and the circuit is fabricated. Design and fabrication procedures are presented together with suggestions for alternative means of accomplishing the same or similar tasks. It is shown that only a modest amount of specialized equipment is required."
"A successful, student oriented, minimum super-vision, thick-film microcircuit laboratory is described. Key laboratory processes and examples of student projects are illustrated. In the laboratory, emphasis is placed on the use of thick-film technology as a design medium which enables the student to relate theoretical models to real world problems. Laboratory organization is discussed and sources of equipment and supplies noted. A detailed outline of associated lecture topics with references is also given."
"In order to maintain a high quality of instruction at colleges and universities there must be a means of measuring teaching effectiveness. Four factors for evaluation are mentioned, namely: (1) delayed student opinions; (2) opinions of colleagues; (3) achievement on examinations; and (4) achievement in subsequent courses. A detailed description is given of the procedures for and experiences on a rigorous means of obtaining student opinions two years after their instruction."
"This paper describes an attempt to teach physical electronics with the aid of interactive use of the computer by students. The aim was to increase student motivation and retention while minimizing the amount of time spent on the mechanics of programming and terminal operation. An essential part of this was to use display terminals to present much of the information graphically. Six prepackaged programs were developed. The topics covered by these programs are described briefly and an evaluation of the running costs and student reaction is given. Although assessment of the educational value is largely subjective, it is concluded that the approach was successful in reaching its goal."
"This paper describes a laboratory developed to accompany a course in communications theory. The laboratory program is based on the use of building block modules, corresponding to the standard elements found in communication systems. The use of such modules enables the students to model complete systems without becoming involved in detailed problems of circuit design. The module system is described and its use in typical experiments is discussed."
"When students are introduced for the first time to electromagnetic theory, it is either presented as a set of separate aspects like electrostatics, magnetostatics, slow and fast varying fields etc., or in the unified form of Maxwell's equations. In the first case, students are likely to consider the different aspects as physically different phenomena, whilst in the last case, the mathematical formalism makes the physical understanding of electromagnetism difficult. This paper discusses the advantages of introducing special relativity as a unifying concept, providing at the same time better physical insight into electricity and magnetism and their mutual relationship. A description of an introductory course in relativity, given by the author to second year undergraduates, is presented. A list of educational objectives stated in behavioral terms is also given. This list of objectives has been found particularly helpful in designing instruction and establishing evaluation criteria."
"This paper describes an instructional method that has been tried with remarkable success in some traditionally theoretical senior-level and graduate courses. The objective of the instructional approach is to enable the students to tackle practical design problems and carry the solution to the stage of prescribing enough details to fabricate the \"product\" if need be. In class contact the subject material is covered by first describing its typical applications and developing important concepts in the context of the solution of practical problems. The students read on their own the course notes prior to the discussion on each chapter. Because of the tremendous saving of class time normally expended in theoretical derivations, etc., the contact time is utilized in presenting several possible solutions to real life problems and their comparative evaluation. Particularly difficult theoretical concepts are the only ones covered in class, using no more than 10 to 15 percent of the contact time. Because of the applications-oriented nature of the problems, the students consider their learning experience \"excellent.\" The results of anonymous surveys dramatically bear out the student confidence in this approach to learning."
"The topic of noise and interferences in electrical networks is seldom discussed at the sophomore or junior levels. Electrical Engineering students, however, may encounter interference problems in their first laboratory course. Practical techniques of noise minimization in measurement setups are usually considered a work of art rather than a topic that can be methodically introduced. This paper describes a laboratory experiment investigating noise sources and their elimination that requires only inexpensive and generally available instrumentation. Background material is presented in a simplified manner taking into consideration the fact that the students at this level have not been exposed to probability and advanced electromagnetic theories. The experiment concentrates on the environmental noise and the various techniques to reduce the coupling between the system and noise sources. A brief introduction to noisy signal detection techniques is also included."
"This paper describes an application of self-paced instruction (SPI) to a combined lecture-laboratory course in logic circuits. The results of this effort show the SPI approach to require less faculty time than the conventional lecture approach. The student time required is approximately comparable by either method. The paper concludes with comments on the procrastination problem."
"This paper describes some results of a course in network analysis taught to all electrical and mechanical engineering sophomores at the University of New Hampshire. The report covers two years experience with the course. The first year (spring 1971) forty students took the course under an individually prescribed instruction approach (IPI) while fifty students were taught with the standard lecture-recitation method. The second year (spring 1972), all seventy students took the course under PI. Comparison between students in IPI and the lecture-recitation method by semester end test, a three month retention test, and performance in the next electrical engineering course indicate no significant difference in the material learned. A detailed questionnaire was filled out by each IPI student. Most significant were the responses that indicated that although most students considered the IPI approach to be more work, most preferred it to the standard approach."
"Aperture antenna theory usually produces integrals for radiation patterns which are difficult to evaluate. One resort is to complement the formal teaching by a computer simulation of the radiation due to a line source with arbitrary excitation. Suggested exercises will lead the student to acquire knowledge of various effects in practical aperture type antennas. The program allows several input modes and is written so that it can be adapted for discrete antenna arrays."
"In designing a modern computer laboratory to assist in teaching minicomputer technology, many tradeoffs must be made. This paper describes a unique computer laboratory and outlines some of the decisions which were made in its development."
"It is proposed that in courses where individual laboratory experience is desirable but not essential, pairs of students be used to demonstrate the course material to their fellow students. Such an approach conducted at California State University, Northridge, is described."

 "This paper describes a CAI system being used in an introductory computer science course. The system is generative in the sense that it generates its own problems, derives its own solutions, monitors student solutions, and generates remedial statements. Due to its generative nature, the system provides a great deal of individualization of instruction. It selects the path taken by each student through the course concepts on an individual basis as a function of its prior experience with the student. It also tailors the difficulty of the problem generated, the degree of monitoring, and the amount of help provided to suit each student's past performance. This paper describes the special properties of generative CAI which make it particularly useful for problem-oriented courses. It discusses how the teaching algorithms are designed and how problems are generated. It also describes how the system algorithms can be used to analyze student responses, determine the nature of the student error, and generate pertinent remedial feedback."
"An experimental teaching strategy was employed in a three-quarter introductory Electrical Engineering course. The system was designed to combine the best features of PSI (Proctoral System of Instruction, also known as the Keller Method) and the conventional system, in the context of engineering education. The most important feature is that it allows students to master every assigned problem and rewards them for that mastery. It was found that a very high percentage of students will take advantage of this opportunity. The percentage of students successfully completing the course was high-73%. The experiment was an exploratory one; no control group was employed. Therefore, the net pedagogical impact is not known. But it is known that the system is highly liked by students and is very good for morale."
"Two instructional experiments related to the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity and to the thermionic emission properties of single crystal silicon have been performed in ultra-high vacuum. The measurements are straightforward, using standard electronic components, and can be successfully completed by senior electrical engineering students in one semester. The experiments form a good introduction for undergraduate students who expect to do further work in areas related to semiconductors and/or ultra-high vacuum."
"A simple, inexpensive, special-purpose digital computer was built to exemplify the obvious as well as the subtle properties of correlation. The method augmented the usual mathematical introduction of this material. Using such common peripheral equipment as a function generator with V.C.O. capabilities, analog noise generator and oscilloscope, such concepts as auto-and-cross-correlation, stochastic filtering, and signal detection can be dynamically explored."
"Over the past decade approximately one-half of all institutions offering the Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering in the U.S. and Canada have dropped the mandatory requirement for translation skills. This correspondence attempts to reveal the nature and extent of this trend."
"In the Winter Quarter 1972 the Electrical Engineering Department at Ohio State offered a new course for nonengineering students. The course followed the text, The Man Made World, and included a film and guest lecture series. The 25 students who completed the course achieved some appreciation for and facility with quantitative procedures for solving problems and indicated their approval of the course. Adjusting to the wide range in the students' interests and ability, (especially mathematical), and stimulating classroom participation were major difficulties. The course, considered a success, will be offered again in the future on a regular basis, and large enrollments are expected since the course now satisfies the natural science requirement for many students in the University."
"This article describes two courses on the technology of communication and transportation designed for non-science students. The courses combine lectures on technology and student presentations on the interaction of the technology with their own areas of interest. The course content is presented and the method of teaching is explained. This article describes two courses on technology that have been designed for non-science majors at Yale University. The two courses respectively present the technology of communication and transportation. The outlines for the courses are given in the Appendix. The communication course has been taught for four years and the transportation course for three years."
"The solution of a variety of physical problems is possible by the analog approach using available circuit analysis programs such as ECAP and SCEPTRE. The solution of Laplaces equation for a square trough, the frequency response for a rotational mechanical system, and the thermal response in a rocket are presented as illustrative examples."
"Several systems exist for the purpose of assisting the instructor in evaluating class comprehension by monitoring their individual and/or collective responses to multiple-choice questions. Such a system, the Student-Teacher Interface System (STIS), is described and its capabilities are compared with those of other systems. The STIS is a special-purpose digital processor which provides a considerable amount of real-time display information to both the instructor and class. Sotne of the benefits associated with such a system are discussed and the students' opinions of the class feedback displays are presented. With the use of MSI integrated citcuits it is estimated that the instructor console could be built for under $500."

"The present uses of accelerators in nuclear medicine and radiation therapy are summarized. Attention is called to the widespread use of these devices for production of radioisotopes for diagnostic purposes and of x rays for treatment of cancer. Developments presently underway to make use of high energy heavy nuclear particles for both isotope production and therapy are discussed and an overview is presented of one of a new family of accelerators nearing completion. In view of the large fraction of the total population who stand to benefit from better diagnostic and therapy modalities, the question is posed whether more adequate resources should not be made available for improving diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities while minimizing radiation dose to the patient."
"Several spectrometers carried in the Service Module of the Apollo 15 and Apollo 16 spacecraft were employed for the compositional mapping of the lunar surface. The observations involved the measurements of secondary (fluorescent) X-rays, gamma-rays and alpha particle emissions. A large scale compositional map of over 20 percent of the lunar surface was obtained for the first time. It was possible to demonstrate interesting chemical differences between the mare and the highlands, to find specific areas of high radioactivity and to learn something about the composition of the moon's hidden side."
"The legislative background required in the preparation of environmental statements is reviewed. The actual procedures followed in developing statements for AEC at Argonne is described in some detail, and the future course of such activities is discussed."
"The new interest in determining small changes in environmental radiation levels as evidenced by the establishment of as low as practicable numerical criteria indicates a need for reliable low-level radiation measurements. Though the expected contributions from routine operation of nuclear facilities are small compared to existing contributions to dose from natural radioactivity, cosmic radiation and fallout, monitoring programs should be modified to document actual levels and improve public relations as originally suggested by the ICRP. The relative value of instantaneous environmental exposure rate measurements and continuous monitoring is described. Model experiments, some by the Health and Safety Laboratory, are being performed to establish the ranges of validity of dose assessment calculations and improve monitoring techniques. The importance of studies of background variations, trends in long-term additions to the environment, and pathway-to-man analyses is described."
  "The problem of spectral interference in large volume radioactive samples counted in a guarded Ge(Li) spectrometer is attacked by a new approach. By making the sample itself a liquid scintillator detector, and using coincidence and anticoincidence gating, the detrimental effects of self absorption can be eliminated. In addition, this technique (denoted gamma-beta coincidence and gamma-beta anticoincidence spectrum analysis) allows discrimination between modes of decay. The system design, logic, performance, and significance to low level radionuclide analysis is presented."
"An evaluation of a 26.3% relative efficiency Ge(Li) detector for low-level radionuclide analysis has been made. The detector performance for sources mounted at the detector end cap was compared with the other smaller Ge(Li) detectors and with an opposed Ge(Li) two detector system. Factors studied included resolution, peak-to-Compton ratios, background, detection efficiency at the end cap, source geometry, and relative sensitivity. The 26.3% relative efficiency detector was found to give superior end cap efficiencies, peak-to-Compton ratios, and relative sensitivities without sacrificing performance in the other factors studied."
"The operation of large nuclear power plants involves significant inventories of radioactive fission product isotopes. Effective monitoring of effluent streams from nuclear facilities requires the characterization of radioactivity present in operating systems to permit evaluation of potential hazards which might result from discharge of any radioactivity to the environment. The need for adequate documentation and control of effluents establishes a requirement for realtime determination of radioactivity on an isotopic basis. The purpose of this paper is to outline the application of high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometry to this problem. To meet the requirement for a practical working system it has been necessary to develop a completely automated gamma-ray spectrometer concept incorporating a remote computer operated pulse-height analyzer, calibration and data analysis techniques. An operating system will be described which utilizes a PDP-9 data system to operate a number of on-line spectrometers, providing automated data analysis and report generation. A detailed description of the techniques and hardware developed for this purpose will be presented."
"A beta-gamma-gamma multidimensional spec trometer has been developed which employs two 12-inch diameter by 8-inch thick NaI(Tl) crystals with associated 4-inch thick NaI light pipes and two 5-inch diameter by 1/2-inch thick gas proportional counters as principal detectors and which utilizes two 40-inch diameter by 24-inch thick plastic phosphors as anticoincidence shields. The detector system is coupled to two 4096 word computer memories which record gamma-ray events in coincidence with either beta detector. The gamma-ray energies identify the radionuclide while the beta detectors can identify the relative position of the radioactivity in the specimen being analyzed. The background and efficiency of the system and its application to the identification of radionuclides in environmental, biological, and extraterrestrial materials are discussed."
"This paper describes the design of a risetime discriminator circuit (RTD), with associated anticoincidence/coincidence (AC/C) logic and its application to the counting of low-activity tritium samples in gas proportional counter systems. The circuitry, packaged in a double-width NIM, extracts signal risetime information which is used in conjunction with the output of an annular guard counter to electronically reject background counts due to high energy charged particles (μ-mesons), and gamma-ray photons. The use of the guard and AC/C logic without RTD is effective in reducing the background due to charged particles because of the high probability of coincidental detection by the guard and proportional counters. However, the reduction of backgromd related to gamma-ray photons by simple AC/C techniques is ineffective because of the small probability of a coincidence event occurring in the two counters. The RTD circuit utilizes the property that gamma photons and high energy pmesons produce ionization tracks in the proportional counter that are typically longer and have lower specific charge density than those tracks produced by low-energy (tritium) beta particles. Thus, these events have longer charge collection times and result in slower signal risetimes at the output of a charge-sensitive (integrating) preamplifier. The RTD circuit differentiates the wide-band preamplifier signal which produces a pulse with amplitude proportional to the signal risetime. The derivative is then peak-detected, stretched, delayed and inverted. An amplitude comparison is then made between the stretched derivative and the linear input signal using a linear summation amplifier."
"Located in the Science Instrument Module of Apollo 15 and 16, the Alpha Particle Spectrometer was designed to detect and measure the energy of alpha particles emitted by the radon isotopes and their daughter products. The spectrometer sensor consisted of an array of totally depleted silicon surface barrier detectors. Biased amplifier and linear gate techniques were utilized to reduce resolution degradation, thereby permitting the use of a single 512 channel PHA. Sensor identification and in-flight radioactive calibration were incorporated to enhance data reduction."
"The ability of a channel multiplier to record radiation incident through its side walls has been studied, using mono-energetic MeV-electrons and protons and cosmic ray muons. The results indicate that about 25% of the total length of the detector is sensitive ta this radiation with a detection efficiency depending on particle type and energy."
"A new type of position sensitive detection system for ultraviolet and x-ray photons and for particles is described. A compact laboratory model with one-dimensional readout was constructed and tested. The full width at half maximum response to single x-rays was typically 0.13 mm, but the position determination accuracy was comparable to the channel center-to-center spacing of 0.053 mm. The detection system can be readily adapted to two-dimensional readout. Potential applications of this device for single-photon and flux counting in ultraviolet and x-ray astronomy are discussed."
"A tuned-secondary sinewave oscillator combined with a Cockcroft-Walton voltage multiplier has been developed which produces 40 μA at 4500 volts from 12 VDC with 80% efficiency. Optimum efficiency is obtained by considering the Cockcroft-Walton multiplier as part of the oscillator design. Equations are developed for calculating the multiplier output voltage and ripple as a function of the oscillator output frequency and amplitude, the capacitance of the multiplier, the number of multiplier stages, and the load current. The Atmosphere Explorer Photoelectron Spectrometer electron multiplier bias supply is also described to illustrate practical design tradeoffs and techniques employed when the supply is used in a satellite-borne particle detection experiment."
"A multiplier phototube is an extremely sensitive device used to measure ultraviolet, visible and near infrared radiant energy. Physically, multiplier phototubes are high vacuum tubes which are comprised of a photo-cathode; an electron lens, which directs the photo-electrons onto the first dynode; a series of dynodes or amplifying stages; and an anode or collector. The use of multiplier phototubes in photometric and nuclear detectors for satellite systems has increased dramatically within the last few years. Because many of these systems are subjected to either natural or artificially created radiation, such as encountered in the Van Allen belts, or the South Atlantic anomaly, or galactic or solar cosmic radiation, a study of the behavior of these tubes under such conditions has become necessary. This paper summarizes the work of EMR and that of many other investigators, and discusses degradation of optical windows used; effects on photocathodes and dynodes; effects on noise, dark current and resolution. A list of conclusions is given."
"The High Energy Cosmic Ray Experiment, flown on balloons by a group at Goddard Space Flight Center, is designed to measure the charge, the energy, and the arrival direction of high-energy cosmic rays. A wiregrid spark chamber is employed to determine the trajectory of each incident primary particle which satisfies the experiment trigger criteria. Optimum trajectory-determination efficiency depends on parameters, the values of which vary with the charge of the incident particle. The functional dependence on the voltage applied to the wire grids and on the delay in application of the high voltage trigger for several different values of the DC clearing field was measured for fully ionized nitrogen nuclei and for singly charged particles. The voltage was found to be the most suitable parameter to vary in order to maximize the spark formation efficiencies and to minimize spurious spark formation. Because of the low fluxes of high-Z, high-energy cosmic rays, long experiment exposure times such as those obtained in satellites are desirable. To adapt the spark chambers for use with experiments with a duration of more than one year and total accumulated events in excess of 3 × 108, the useful life times of both the high-voltage triggering circuit and the spark-chamber gas needed to be improved. Krytron high-voltage triggering devices have been developed which will perform satisfactorily for more than 3 × 108 simulated events at a rate of 10 events/ sec, an improvement of approximately a factor of 10."
 "A position-sensitive, low-energy proportional counter system is described which will be used on the High-Energy Astronomical Observatory, Mission A, spacecraft. The associated system incorporates the capability to employ pulse-shape discrimination for background rejection and interpolation circuitry to locate the centroid of an X-ray event with an accuracy of approximately one eighth the cathode-wire spacing."
"A new concept for delay line readout of multiwire proportional counters for detecting the position of ionizing particles is described. It significantly reduces the complexity and cost of a multiwire system compared to alternative methods, making it attractive for space flight applications. This integral delay chamber can provide spatial resolution approaching 0.1 mm using Fe55, provided careful consideration is given to geometrical parameters that determine delay line bandwidth and phase distortion. For a chamber of 35 by 35 cm2 a delay of 20 ns/cm and attenuation of 0.05 dB/cm has been obtained. The delay line characteristics and electronic resolution, using a peak detection method, are given as a function of chamber geometry."
"A charged particle scintillation spectrometer with a geometric factor of 350 cm2 sr has been built and flown in polar orbit aboard the Air Force STP 72-1(1972-076B) Satellite. The primary purpose of the sensor is to measure low-intensity solar proton fluxes over the polar caps, in the energy range of 1-15 MeV. Incorporated in the circuitry is a pulse-shape discrimination scheme enabling the instrument to differentiate between protons and electrons. A second pulse shape discriminator prevents analysis of signals produced by particles which penetrate the primary (CsI (T1) Scintillator and produce light in a backing layer of fast scintillating plastic."
"We describe results of an investigation to develop multiwire proportional chamber systems utilizing electromagnetic delay lines for high resolution cosmic ray experiments. The delay line used is a plexiglas core type, with a delay constant of 7 nsec/mm. The interpolation properties of this readout scheme resulted in a measured spatial resolution of 75 microns (HWHM), using iron-55 X-rays and a wire spacing of 1 mm. Tracking accuracy over a 6 mm region near the center of the chamber was better than ±7 microns when fitted to a linear spatial dependence combined with a sinusoid of wire-spacing periodicity."
"A survey of the currently used electronics with multiwire proportional chambers is examined for the high energy physics applications."
"From the performance data measured, it appears that the SH0997 and SH1153 prototypes come very close to meeting all the significant points of the joint Laboratory specification. The major exception noted, that of non-ideal matching of thresholds, appears to be a question of procedure and not a fundamental limitation. This is reinforced by the fact that Fairchild is maintaining the 1 mV minimum sensitivity specification. Similarly, the problem of the fast OR width and the Read gate error appear easily soluble. The operation of the SH11153 appears to meet all significant specifications. In both units, all signals are exceptionally clean and inter-channel crosstalk appears insignificant for either polarity of overdrive. With the corrections noted, it appears that future units should meet or exceed all the major points of the joint Laboratory specifications for proportional wire chamber integrated circuits."
"In this paper the significance of various noise sources in field-effect transistors is discussed. The intrinsic thermal noise of the conducting channel can be reduced by reducing the channel length. A lower limit to the channel length is set by the carrier velocity saturation effects, which are the hot carrier channel noise and the gate leakage current due to impact ionization. Devices with a ratio of the transconductance to the input capacitance of 3 x 109 sec-1 have been made, and a further improvement appears to be possible."
 "Fast logic circuits with the repetition rate of 200 MHz and the time resolution of 10-9 s have been digitized using the CAMAC interface. Some results of a project of the fast coincidence system connected to the CAMAC autonomous control system are presented. In the sysgte the operating mode of the coincidence unit and the inherent delay of the logic channels can be set automatically and the stability of the system can be controlled during the experiment. The Digital Coincidence Unit and the Digital Delay are described. The fast coincidence system presented in this paper is intended for particle beam identification and triggering of the set of counter hodoscopes in high energy physics experiments."
"Optimum timing using a simple noise suppressed leading edge trigger technique is described. A short review with formulation of time walks and jitters of various leading edge trigger techniques is given in connection with the noise suppression leading edge trigger (NSLET) technique. As a demonstration of the advantage of the NSLET technique, time resolution of a NaI(Tl) detector has been measured and the improved results are compared with the results obtained with conventional techniques."
"Accurate beam intensity and total charge per accelerator pulse are important data for a number of experiments performed at NAL. The beam-current transformer and its electronics are operable in a beam intensity of 1010 protons, or more, delivered within a time interval of 100 μs. Special features of the design include both analog and digital outputs. The beam toroid is completely external to the vacuum pipe, giving optimum vacuum conditions. In situ test-signal injection and toroidalcore degaussing are incorporated."
"A random pulse generator has been designed that utilizes a charge control concept to provide controlled voltage transitions at average rates from 10 Hz to 1 MHz. These voltage transitions may be coupled to a charge sensitive amplifier system via the standard calibration capacitor to induce impulses of charge, thereby closely approximating the signal from a detector. Between pulses, the voltage decays in an exponential fashion not unlike any tail pulse generator. However, the voltage transition (or step) is independent of the decay, thus recurring steps will ride up the tail of the decay, eliminating the step amplitude dependance upon decay time (𝑡 𝒹) found in other tail pulse generators. This last fact permits repetition rates far in excess of the 1/8 𝑡 𝒹 limitation commonly incurred. To complement this pulse shaping ability, the clock circuit provides both periodic triggers and random triggers. The random time distribution has been measured at several rates and verified to be Poisson. Pulse shaping controls and a polarity switch provide versatility and an output buffer amplifier allows cable termination without affecting the pulse shape. The amplitude has been measured over the frequency range of 10 Hz to 100 kHz and was found to vary less than ±0.05%. The random pulse generator is packaged in a double width NIM and utilizes± 12 volts and ± 24 volts for the power source."
"An economical 8-channel sample-and-hold unit, serially addressable with multiplexed output, is described. The unit accepts clipped inputs of 5 nsec (nominal) FWHM; the positive overshoot of the clipped pulse is rejected. The outputs are held to ± 1 mV for ≥ 1 msec, and are linear to ±1% from 30 mV to 1 V. The output sensitivity is 10 mV per picocoulomb of input charge."
"A circuit has been developed for an Isotope Calibrator which will accurately measure ionization chamber currents in the order of 10-14 to 10-7amps. The circuit incorporates a self-zeroing feedback network which virtually eliminates drift, as well as high impedance MOS FET switches and a MOS insulated gate FET source follower in the input circuit to minimize errors due to leakage currents."
"A short analysis of a hodoscope system and digital arithmetic devices for selection a defined scattering angle is made. Some construction and experimental results are presented."
"A compact, high speed, low cost, charge sensitive preamp-amplifier has been constructed for use in a mass spectrometer data readout array. The device, which is capable of handling count rates up to 1 MHz, can be mounted on a 2 x 8 cm circuit board. The circuit was designed as a high rate counter-amplifier, but it has also been determined to be sufficiently linear so that with suitable shaping of the output signal, pulse height analysis is feasible."
"Several new instruments for process control, laboratory analyses, and product assay and inventory were developed for the 24XCm and 252Cf production programs at SRP. Alpha activities between 106 and 10' dpm and neutron activities up to 1011 n/sec are monitored, picogram amounts of 252 Cf and nanogram amounts of 244Cm are determined routinely, and precision assays of up to 100-mg quantities of 252Cf product are quickly made."
"A four-channel Time Interval Meter (TIM) with one-eighth nanosecond resolution was designed and packaged into a triple width CAMAC module. The TIM has a common Start and four Stop Inputs with a total range of 65 536 nanoseconds (plus an overflow bit). The basic accuracy is dependent on an internal 125 MHz clock. Preliminary measurements indicate a standard deviation of 185 pseconds."
"An attempt to quantitatively calculate the time resolutions from different combinations of Ge gamma-ray detectors, filters, and time pick-off techniques, is described. The study is based on charge collection time calculations previously studied, optimizations of filters, and the choice of parameters in the different time pick-off techniques. Results of the time resolution simulations with a 3 cc planar detector and a 5.6 cc coaxial detector of the Ge (Li) type, are presented and are in good agreement with previously obtained experimental and theoretical results. A brief discussion of the most common trigger modes (and related time jitters and time walks) particularly in reference to the Ge gamma-ray detectors, is also given."
"A computer-based gamma-ray imaging system has been developed for use with rectilinear scanners. It has been designed as a stand-alone system for the small nuclear medicine clinic. Completely processed images are produced in a time short compared with scanning times. The process for correction of gamma-ray scattering in the patient and penetration of gamma rays through the collimator septa produces marked improvement in the images."
 "It has long been recognized that in-patient scattering can lead to significant ima, ge degradation in nearly all radioisotope imaging. Using biased Monte Carlo codes and experimental determinations, we have undertaken a study of three aspects of this problem: 1. Scattering and attenuation within the patient, 2. Selective rejection of scattered radiation by angular selection of the collimation system, 3. Selective rejection of scattered radiation by energy selection. The model we have assumed consists of point gamma ray sources of energy between 140 and 511 keV, located at depths between zero and 10 cm below the surface of a semi-infinite water medium. Ellett has shown that at the energies of interest here, water is a good representation of a tissue medium. A wide variety of general data on the energy and spatial distributions of the escaping scattered radiation have been catalogued."
 "A preliminary feasability study of a camera for imaging of positron emitting radioisotopes based on two arrays of Ge detectors operated in coincidence has been carried out. Efficiency, effects of energy resolution, and timing characteristics have been studied. It has been found that Ge can compete favorably with NaI in efficiency if Compton signals can be admitted for imaging. Analysis of the effect of scattered radiation indicates the advisability of having some moderate energy resolution in the system. A method is devised which allows the use of the Compton signals of the Ge detectors in a summing mode and, therefore, maintain very good energy resolution. A study of the timing properties of small Ge detectors indicates that count rates as high as one order of magnitude more than those possible with NaI detector arrays should be possible. Also, for the first time, it appears realistically possible that tomography by time-of-flight techniques can be carried out with a camera. It is concluded that a small prototype camera section should be built and investigated further."
"This paper attempts to assess the state of the art of semiconductor probe detectors as a tool for nuclear medicine and radiobiology. The following points are discussed: -Operation of Semiconductor probes in the pulse mode (for tracer work) and in the photovoltaic mode (for dosimetry). -Encapsulation of the detector element. -Optimization of the electronics. -Energy resolution of the probes. -Spatial resolution of the probes. -Sensitivity to different kinds of radiation. -Clinical and experimental applications as given by the literature. -Reasons why these devices have not been widely accepted as clinical tools."
"A set of GaAs biomedical probes for in vivo measurement of ß- and γray emitting radioactive elements has been fabricated from liquid-phase epitaxial and boat grown GaAs materials. The probes use a GaAs surface barrier diode as a radiation sensing element and utilize three diode structure shapes, such as side window, frontal window and single ended coaxial structures. The noise performance of GaAs biomedical probe was less than 18 keV at room temperature. Some of GaAs probes developed had good counting efficiency for ß- and g=g-ray emitting radioisotopes and also had good energy resolution for low energy γ-ray and X-ray. The preliminary results of GaAs biomedical probes developed to diagnose malignant tumor and measure regional blood flow were good. The feasibility of GaAs detector as a fluorescent X-ray detector operating at room temperature in nuclear medicine is also discussed."
"Medical probes utilising CdTe detectors have been developed and their potential for uptake (or tracer) measurements and dosimetry has been evaluated. It is found that they are suitable for uptake measurements involving both beta and gamma emitting radiopharmaceuticals. Under carefully defined operating conditions CdTe probes can give an approximately tissue equivalent response, and so the same probe can be used for dosimetry and uptake measurements. Further work is necessary to fully establish the potential and characteristics of these devices."
"Prostatic carcinoma is second only to lung cancer as the most common cause of death from cancer in the United States for males over 50 years of age. In an attempt to facilitate early detection of prostatic cancer, a probe has been constructed and a radiopharmaceutical selected to assist the urologist during rectal examination of the prostate. Probe characteristics and data obtained from patients with and without prostatic carcinoma are presented."
"A high-resolution, high-efficiency, gas-filled, position-sensitive x-ray camera for diagnostic Nuclear Medicine will be described. The simple integral parallel hole collimator allows a spatial resolution of less than 1 mm. and holds down the front foil allowing the counter to be pressurized to greater than 10 atmospheres for high efficiency."
"The data acquisition system at the ORIC is reviewed, and several of the data acquisition techniques used are described. The experience of two years of data acquisition with the system is discussed, and a special effort is made to assess the merits and capabilities of an associative memory technique. A current development in the programs for data acquisition is sketched, and a simple graphics technique for line printers is presented which permits plotting 3 data points per line."
 "Use of a manually operated shaft encoder to increment or decrement a word in memory is described by which means it is possible to control both a computer display and the simple data processing functions normally performed in the nuclear physics laboratory. The relative merits of this technique and the light pen are discussed."
"The philosophy used in detector configuration design and small computer programming for an Automatic Radioactive Inventory System is presented. The range of application is nondestructive, low-density energy analysis from natural and fallout radiation in soils to high-level radiation in solid waste packages."
"A magnetostrictive readout modular system using fast TTL memories is described in this paper. The main characteristics of this system are its expandability, its simple logic configuration, its high recording speed and its capacity of 15 sparks/wand with a word length of 16 bits per spark."
"A complete system of electronics for digitizing pulses from a large array of multi-wire proportional counters is described. The system is based on the method of coupling the chamber pulses onto delay lines developed by Perez-Mendez. All three wire planes of each chamber are digitized, giving positional information for each avalanche in the chamber on three coordinates, x, y and a redundant coordinate. The system will be used with an array of 30 ch-iambers each one meter square, which will serve as an External Muon Identifier (EMI) for the 15-foot diameter bubble chamber in the neutrino beam line at NAL. Up to 16 events can be digitized in a 60 us beam spill."
"Two aspects of fluorescent scanning have received insufficient attention in the past. The fluorescent scanning system is inherently tomographic and is capable of almost complete rejection of activity due to tracer outside the plane of interest. The fluorescent system is also capable of providing exact quantitative determinations of tracer content. These two unique attributes may be helpful in future medical applications of x-ray fluorescence."
 "A system of rectilinear scanning has been developed which senses the presence of particular elements by measuring the differential attenuation of x-ray photons about a specific absorption edge. A continuous x-ray spectrum generated from a side-window 50 kVcp tube is used and the transmitted beam is detected by an energy selective Ge(HP) semiconductor detector. Measurements on phantoms with absorbers up to 10 cm thick indicate sensitivity to middle Z elements such as iodine, down to the range of 1 mg/cm2 in reasonable scanning times. Little effect was seen by additional 1\" absorbers, and the effects of in-line voids can be minimized. Scans were taken of rabbit kidneys and bileary tracts as an iodated contrast agent was infused, and of rabbit lungs while the animal breathed a xenon/oxygen mixture. Future directions for this technique of transmission scanning are discussed."
"The replacement of conventional clinical techniques and the development of new techniques using solid state detectors are discussed. Work presented here includes a simplified (geometry and counting-time independent) method for in-vitro iodine and bromine determinations, in-vivo iodine measurements through a tissue absorption correction based on the ratio of. Kα to Kβ radiation, cardiac output studies, and evaluation of absorptive characteristics of cerebral ventricles."
"A six element, high purity germanium (HPGe) detector array has been designed, constructed and tested as the prototype of a 144 element, multiplanar detector array for local cerebral blood flow measurements in 144 subdivisions of the human brain using 133Xe. The design requirements of the detection system are discussed relative to the brain \"block\" model, the photon energy range, and other available photon detectors. The characteristics and performance of the prototype array are described as well as the advantages of HPGe detectors for applications in nuclear medicine and large arrays."
"Experimental radiographic screens of Y2O2S:Tb, when using ordinary (blue-sensitive) medical x-ray film, are shown to have a speed three to four times that of commercial CaWO4, and about twice that of Gd2O2S:Tb in the medical x-ray energy range of 30 to 100 kVp. The resolutions in each case were comparable. Calculations of the relative speed of these screens are made from the x-ray attenuation coefficients, the cathodoluminescent efficiencies, and the spectral response of the film. These calculations agree quite well with the observed values. Resolution data are presented in terms of the square wave response function for experimental and commercial radiographic screens. Results of exposures made with an experimental x-ray film sensitized for the green spectral region with Y2O2S:Tb and Gd2O2S:Tb radiographic intensifying screens are presented."
"A rotating target has been developed that has the potential for providing an initial yield of 1013 neutrons per second by the T(d,n) He4 reaction, and a useable lifetime in excess of 600 hours. This yield and lifetime are indicated for a 300 KV and 30 mA deuteron accelerator and a 30 μm thick titanium tritide film formed of the stoichiometric compound TiT2. The potential for extended lifetime is made possible by incorporating a sputtering electrode that permits use of titanium tritide thicknesses much greater than the deuteron range. The electrode is used to remove in situ depleted titanium layers to expose fresh tritide beneath. The utilization of the rotating target as a source of fast neutrons for cancer therapy is discussed."
"We describe the performance of a multiwire proportional chamber filled with Xenon (93% Xe, 7% C02) to a pressure of 60 psi absolute. The readout is by the electromagnetic delay line method. Measurements taken at 60 keV and 140 keV show that 1 mm and 2 mm lead grid patterns can be resolved. MTF curves are given for both these energies and the projected performance for clinical work with 99Tc is described."
"A prototype liquid xenon γ-camera has been constructed and preliminary results obtained. The sensitive volume is 7 cm × 7 cm in area and 4.5 cm thick. Orthogonal coordinates for each interacting γ-ray are provided by 24 anode wires 5 μ in diameter spaced 2.8 mm apart and 24 cathode strips."
"The computer requirements of a Department of Radiotherapy are indicated. A computer system is being developed which will meet these requirements. The system presently incorporates both an on-line tumor registry and an interactive, graphicallyoriented, treatment-planning capability. The system uses a dedicated PDP 11 computer. With this system the radiotherapist will query the registry for plans associated with maximum success in similar cases. He will then interactively adapt this plan to the needs of a specific patient."
"As an introductory paper to the session on Plasma Research for Fusion Power, it is intended that this paper provide an overview of the research problems and status in this area, with an emphasis on the continuing need for careful diagnostic measurements of the relevant plasma characteristics."
"Neutron production from plasmas generated by relativistic electron beam and exploding wire discharges is surveyed. Diagnostics appropriate to distinguishing neutrons produced by acceleration mechanisms from thermonuclear sources are discussed. The results of applying these techniques to exploding wire plasmas indicate that the dominant neutron source is thermonuclear fusion."
"Capacitive energy storage is one of the oldest forms of energy storage for pulsed power requirements. Most energy storage capacitors are made of Kraft paper and aluminum foil and impregnated with castor oil. A typical capacitor stores ~ 3000 joules at voltage ratings of 5 kV - 100 kV. Two types of switches are used for capacitor bank switching, ignitrons and pressurized spark gaps. Ignitrons are commercially available, have a wide voltage operating range and are easy to trigger. However, they are limited to ~ 20 kV for most applications and they will prefire. Spark gaps can be designed for reliable operation at almost any voltage level but they are rarely commercially available. Most spark gaps do not operate satisfactorily below 50% of their design voltage and they require a more complicated trigger system than ignitrons. Low inductance coaxial cable has been developed for capacitor bank transmission systems. It is relatively inexpensive and commercially available. Parallel plate transmission lines can be designed to accumulate large amounts of current and conduct it to a concentrated load but careful attention must be given to the containment of the magnetic forces involved. Large numbers of ignitrons can be triggered with a simple trigger circuit that will be described. A circuit is also given to automatically trigger a crowbar ignitron. A pulse forming network circuit is presented which uses inductive voltage addition to generate an 800 kA pulse rising in 100 nsec with a pulse length of 500 nsec."
"Inductive energy storage systems are reviewed on the basis of efficiency considerations for purely resistive loads and partially or wholly inductive loads. High-energy charging systems, in particular impulsive homopolar generators, are examined. Relative merits of a number of possible switching systems are also considered. In general inductive storage systems are best adapted to loads with a minimum of inductance. High-energy charging systems typically should exhibit efficiencies of the order of 70%. Efficiency on discharge for resistive loads is limited principally by the switch since inherent circuit losses in large systems are small compared with other losses."
"Pulsed power generators are capable of delivering as much as megajoules of energy in pulses of 100 nsec or less. A brief review of the technological approach to this problem is presented as well as the description of three different devices: Gamble II, AURORA, and a small laboratory device designed at NRL."
"Present plasma confinement systems are reviewed in order to provide an understanding of the developments necessary for demonstrating the scientific feasibility of controlled thermonuclear fusion. Significantly, these systems have several common features which appear certain to be used in more advanced experiments. These features include high field superconducting magnets, neutral beam injection, and vacuum techniques. Beyond the suppressing of plasma instabilities, improvements in these technologies will be required to achieve controlled fusion."
"A major problem area in the study of the feasibility of fusion reactors is the attainment of hot dense plasma for experimental study and the determination of a heating scheme to reach ignition conditions in a reactor. Adiabatic compression in minor and major radius of Tokamak configuration plasmas was proposed as a means of reaching this end. The Adiabatic Toroidal Compressor (ATC) was built at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory to determine experimentally the feasibility of this technique. This paper describes the engineering features of this machine. Preliminary results indicate that compression heating is a possible method of assisting reaching fusion ignition temperatures."
"High precision absolute measurements of the ionization energy (ε) for alpha particles and electrons have been made in two thick high purity silicon guard ring detectors between 100 K and 250 K. At a fixed energy (E) both εα and εe- were found to vary linearly (r = 0.999) with the band gap (WG). εα and εe- also increased with E and εe- α εα. The slope (Δεa/ΔWG) = 1.83 ± 0.04 is the lowest so far reported and is in closer agreement with Drummond and Moll's theoretical value of 1.73. However (Δe-/ΔWG) = 2.87 ± 0.07 is significantly higher. The measured values of ε in electron volts per hole pair (eV/ehp) are: Ee- = 975.2 keV Eα = 5483 Kev εe- (300 K) = 3.631 εα (300 K) = 3.625 εe-(100 K) = 3.745 εα (100 K) = 3.698 The estimated probable error is ± 0.0025 eV/ehp. The εα values are close to other recent published results. These results taken in conjunction with earlier reported work on Si, Ge, GaAs and CdTe suggest that (Δε/ΔWG)≃ 1.8 in all these semiconductors, i.e. over the WG range from 0.7 to 1.6 eV. Therefore there is a need for further ε measurements on high purity samples of all four materials."
"The axial and radial dependence of the netconcentrations of donors and acceptors in high-purity germanium has been investigated. The methods include dc-conductivity measurements on Czochralski grown crystals, Hall effect experiments on full area slices, collimated alpha particle probing on detectors, and C-V measurements on detector arrays. Some quantitative correlations between the results of the different methods are presented. Many of the crystals exhibit internal junctions, whose influence on the properties of high-purity germanium detectors will be discussed."
"The design of collimated sources of Am241, Co57, and Fe55 suitable for scanning germanium detectors is given. Am241 scans taken through the p contact on a p-type detector are given for detectors with and without radial resistivity gradients. The data obtained from these scans are used to calculate the radial dependence of depletion layer width and an \"effective\" carrier concentration. The results obtained indicate that, with the surface treatment used, the surface is accumulated on p-type detectors. At voltages below full depletion, an extra \"peak\" associated with slow pulses originating in the undepleted region is described. The number of these slow pulses depends on the type of back contact that is used."
"Several important areas for the use of germanium spectrometers would be opened if these detectors could be successfully operated at temperatures considerably in excess of 77°K. Precise measurements on a series of detectors made from different high-purity germanium crystals and on one lithium-drifted germanium detector indicate that the resolution does not degrade significantly until nearly 150°K is reached. Similar-sized detectors, including the lithium-drifted device, exhibited essentially identical temperature-resolution relationships."
"Gamma-ray efficiency measurements were made for Si(Li), Ge, CdTe and HgI2 spectrometers and detectors of comparable sizes for gamma ray energies from 60 keV to 3.85 MeV. Full energy efficiency measurements of cooled Si(Li) and Ge spectrometers and a room temperature CdTe spectrometer show that the efficiencies improve in going from silicon (Z= 14) to germanium (Z= 32) to cadmium telluride (Z= 50) in agreement with the photoelectric cross-sections which vary as Z5. Because of its shorter carrier drift lengths, the CdTe spectrometer must be operated at the highest practical voltages. The detection efficiencies, based on all pulses above a threshold set by noise, were measured for Si(Li), CdTe and HgI2 detectors at room temperature. A 30 keV threshold and small photoelectric cross-section combine to give an efficiency minimum for the Si(Li) detector for 100 keV < Eγ < 200 keV. Both CdTe and HgI2 detectors iave no such minimum. In addition the higher electronic stopping powers of HgI2 and CdTe in comparison with Si reduce edge effects - an important factor in high energy γ-ray efficiency."
"Gamma-ray spectrometry is widely used for identification and assay of nuclear fuel and scrap materials. CdTe detectors are especially promising for use by nuclear safeguards inspectors because of their small physical size and good energy resolution. A 20 mm3 CdTe detector has been used to determine the isotopic composition of uranium and plutonium samples. The energy resolution is superior to that of NaI so that the major lines of Pu-239 are more easily distinguished from interfering lines of Pu-241 and Am-241."
"A nucleonic system using an array of source-detector pairs to gauge propellant tanks of up to approximately 20,000 lb under zero g conditions was analyzed. The sources of error in determining the propellant mass were outlined and ways of reducing the sampling error were considered. Detector characteristics, the source strength and photon energy, and the consequential radiation dose and source collimator mass were specified. To test the feasibility of a multi source-detector pair nucleonic gauging system six 200 mm CdTe detectors were positioned opposite six collimated 137Cs sources on an eight foot diameter sphericaltank containing up to 19,000 lb of salt water as a fuel simulant. An accuracy of approximately 0.6% of full tank loading was obtained under 1 g conditions. Propellant loading was determined by counting photoevents above a fixed energy threshold. A separate analysis of the detectors showed that counting efficiencies ranged from 66% to 83% of the theoretical values due to tailing of the photopeak. Due to trapping and detrapping, count rates increased nearly linearly with increasing temperature from -40°C to 65°C with the value 0.35%/°C. Count rates also increased with increasing bias, with values as low as 0.025%/volt. These studies indicate the feasibility of using a highly collimated system of source detector pairs to gauge propellants under zero g conditions."
"Experience with several (commercially available) miniature closed-cycle refrigerators used to cool a high purity germanium photon detector is reported. While maintaining good resolution, closed-cycle cooling has resulted in a versatile photon spectrometer with long storage times, variable length run times, and freedom from the need for a liquid nitrogen supply. The demonstrated resolution and background levels indicate the concept to be especially useful for field measurements in problems of general radioisotope detection and in some applications of on-line x-ray fluorescence."
"Comparative measurements have been made on bevelled and reach-through amplifying detectors. The γ-ray sensitivity of the reach-through diode depends much less on bias voltage and temperature. It has a low operating bias, typically 200 volts, and a plateau of at least 100 volts."
"This paper presents the results of dead-layer thickness measurements on silicon surface-barrier and ion-implanted detectors and a comparison of various methods for measuring dead-layer thicknesses. Our experimental arrangement and estimates of experimental error are discussed. Data on dead-layer thicknesses of n-type and p-type surface-barrier detectors and boron-implanted position-sensitive detectors are given. A linear relation was observed between the dead-layer thickness and the metal electrode thickness for both the rectifying and ohmic contact of barrier detectors. The thinnest dead layers measured were 270Å (silicon equivalent) for 15 μg/cm2 of gold and 460Å (silicon equivalent) for 6 μg/cm2 of aluminum."
"A thin-film thermopile matrix is vacuum deposited on a glass substrate. Nickel and copper thin films are used for the two junction materials. A total of 400 junctions are deposited over an area 2.2 cm by 2.2 cm, corresponding to a junction density of 82 junctions/cm2. Half of these junctions are hot junctions and the other half are reference junctions. The reference junctions are shielded from the incoming pulsed radiation by a 0.05-cm-thick gold shield. All junction pairs are series connected so that the thermal emf's add. An output voltage of 0.1 mV per junction pair is obtained when the device is illuminated with a 1.5-msec pulse from a l-kV xenon flash tube. The output voltage from an individually wired, Chromel-constantan thermopile is 0.2 mV per junction pair when the thermopile is illuminated with an identical pulse."
"Self-powered (s-p) detectors are useful for incore neutron measurements in nuclear reactors because of their small size, ruggedness and simplicity. In one type of detector, a delayed current results from the beta activity induced in the device by the neutron flux while a second type gives an instantaneous response due to the compton electrons produced by the gammas released following the capture of neutrons in the device. To test these physical models and more importantly, to point the way to improvements in design without having to resort to excessive experimentation, a Monte-Carlo model was constructed to allow computations to be made of the response of both types of detector. The calculations were performed for Rh and V delayed and Co instantaneous detectors with emitter diameters of .051 cm and insulator thickness of .025 cm in all cases. The agreement with experiment was fairly good and the small discrepancies which occur are discussed in the paper."
"CAMAC is a modular instrumentation system for transmission of digital data between instruments and between instruments and computers and computer peripherals. The system is described in a general way and the history of the CAMAC development, its expanding utilization in various fields and its current status are discussed. This is an introductory paper delivered at the 1972 Nuclear Science Symposium and is followed by papers that discuss CAMAC in greater detail."
"The experience with CAMAC installations resulting from its widespread use has inevitably led to suggestions for changes in the specifications. The NIM and ESONE Dataway Working Groups spent nearly a year discussing these suggestions during the recently completed process of rewriting and revising the CAMAC specifications. Some of the suggestions were included in the revised specification after careful evaluation of any compatibility problems that might arise. Others were felt to lie outside the intended scope of the specification. In the following, the scope and intent of the CAMAC specification is briefly discussed. Then the significant additions and changes to the Dataway specification are listed, along with some background information. Reference is also made to the information contained in the document \"Supplementary Information on CAMAC System.\""
 "A CAMAC System has been developed at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory to interface with a remotely located computer. The system operating characteristics and several modules developed at LLL are described. These modules are two read-only controllers - one for single crate and one for multiple crate operation, a serial peak detector, three different time interval meters, a serial bit stream generator, a parallel input gate, an A/D converter and its associated modular memory, and a pulse generator. A CAMAC data display which reads a serial bit stream but is not a CAMAC module is also described."
"A display and readout system for CAMAC scalers will be described which has been in use at SLAC for over a year. Flexibility and versatility are the keynotes of the system, which includes a modular quad display unit employing highly readable Nixie tubes. Other units which may be connected to the expandable bus include an X-Y scope display and a preset count module. The system employs a simple, but versatile CAMAC crate controller. Capability for connection to computers is included, and the system has been interfaced to several different computers."
"The NIM Committee and ESONE have formed working groups to study the problems of CAMAC software. This paper summarizes the results which have been obtained to date. The NIM Software Working Group has endorsed six FORTRAN-compatible subroutines for CAMAC software interface, and the ESONE Software Working Group has proposed a high-level CAMAC language."
"Reactor control and core surveillance instrumentation are important to the safety and economics of LMFBR design and operation. Considerable world wide effort has been expended during the past 10 years on such instrumentation. The results of these efforts in France will be tested in Phenix and the U.K. will test theirs in the PFR reactor when these reactors start up in 1973. Meanwhile, development efforts are continuing on a broad front in the U.S., Euope, Japan on LMFBR instrumentation, particularly in the areas of: high temperature neutron detection acoustic monitoring core exit and entrant coolant monitoring sodium process instrumentation (e.g. leak, level, pressure, flow) detection of incipient failure of critical sodium system components (e.g. reactor vessel, heat exchanger tubes, pipes) This paper summarizes LMFBR core instrumentation and control development in the U.S. and Europe."
"Breakdown pulse noise (BPN) is defined as noise pulses, which are indistinguishable from typical neutron counter pulses, generated within insulation of instrumentation cables and seals having dc voltage applied at elevated temperatures. This paper discusses possible mechanisms causing BPN and describes the experimental technique for measuring BPN. Presented data show the importance of backfill gas, density, purity and surface finish on the performance of insulators for use in cables and seals of reactor instrumentation."
"The use of platinum as the emitter in a self-powered flux detector produces a mixed neutron and gamma sensitivity, but typically a higher proportion of prompt response, that is maintained throughout life, than for earlier types. The detector has high output and a low burnup rate, confirmed by two years of extensive tests at high flux."
"An instrument has been developed as part of a flux-tilt protective system for the light-water-cooled, heavy-water-moderated power reactor (CANDU-BLW) at Gentilly, Quebec. This system is independent of the normal over-power protection instrumentation and is designed to prevent overheating of fuel that could result from spatial flux distortions (or tilts). Three identical instruments are used in the system, each comparing currents from ion chambers located at three positions around the reactor. If flux differences become greater than a preset level a trip signal is generated. The reactor is shut down by dumping heavy water if any two instruments generate simultaneous trip signals. Each instrument contains three linear-logarithmic amplifiers, comparators to sense high flux-tilt levels and logic circuits that combine the comparator signals to produce the final output in the form of relay contact closures. A mixed linear-logarithmic signal is developed from the measured ion chamber current to provide a fluxtilt signal that is non-linear with respect to reactor power."
"The three-wire-TCs have been proposed to be replaced with the current outlet thermocouples to obtain much information from the limited number of sensors and to detect the local blockage in the LMFBR subassembly A preliminary application test of the new sensors to the transit-time flowmeter and to the early-warning of local blockage in the LMFBR subassembly is performed utilizing an existing sodium loop for the first time. Test proves that the new sensor is an excellent temperature-fluctuation sensor because of its high speed response and sharp point-sensitivity, and can improve perfoemance of a transit-time-flowmeter. Early-warning of local blockage in the LMFBR subassembly seems very promising. A concept for the subassembly outlet monitoring and a process-filter technique for reception of signals in background noise are discussed."
"A novel and versatile core loading and reactivity measuring system has been designed and reactor tested. The most significant features of the system are the use of a pulsed neutron source for in-core measurements and an on-line reactivity computer coupled with statistical-type measuring channels using a combined counting/Campbelling technique for out-of-core measurements. Advantages of these new measuring techniques and the system hardware are described."
"A gaseous scintillator which features gamma ray and system noise suppression has been studied for possible use in high power density breeder reactors. Spectroscopic information on the light emitted from several gases under fission fragment excitation has been obtained. This information is also useful for the nuclear pumped laser concept. Performance characteristics of a prototype detector at thermal neutron fluxes up to 2 × 1012 n/cm2-sec have been obtained and advantages of the concept are discussed."
"A newly developed pulsed mode of operation of ionization chambers, and the use of neon as an additive to the primary helium fill gas, has demonstrated a wide range capability for neutron flux and reactor power measurements over eight orders of magnitude, independence of high temperature insulator leakage and ionized gas kinetics effects, freedom from recombination effects and a capability for 99% compensation for gamma fields of approximately 105 (R/hr) and higher. A single sensor compensated neutron flux/reactor power measurement system, based on the PIC mode of operation, is proposed that has an inherent linear measurement capability extending over 18 decades of neutron flux density, from approximately 10-2 to 1016 nv."
"This paper extends the Tsypkin Locus method to investigate the stability and the existence of a possible limit-cycle in the control system of a large (coupled-core) reactor. The investigation includes the effect of different phase shifts between two adjacent sections of the core. Two examples are given and a comparison between the Describing Function approach and the more accurate Tsypkin Locus method is made."
"This paper deals with the application of Kalman filter for estimating the non-measurable variables of a nuclear pool-type research reactor using noisy measurements of only a few variables. The estimated variables are used to identify two parameters of the reactor dynamics. These estimates are also useful for reactor control, protection, instrumentation, operator information, etc. The filtering technique can be applied to more complex nuclear steam systems."
"A procedure is presented here to design optimal noninteracting control system for a coupled core nuclear reactor. The optimal feedback coefficients are computed by minimizing a quadratic performance index. Nuclear reactors have inaccessible state variables corresponding to concentration of delayed neutrons. A method is given to reconstruct these inaccessible state variables which are essential for feedback to obtain noninteracting control system."
"An unusual solution to the problem of remote operation of CAMAC data systems has been implemented at the Clinton P. Anderson Meson Physics Facility (LAMPF). Data-link communications from a remote CAMAC system, controlled only by a Microprogrammed Branch Driver (MBD), to another CAMAC system coupled to a digital computer, can effectively extend the CAMAC branch highway to several hundred meters."
"A CAMAC branch driver for the Varian 620 series computers has been designed and built by Kitt Peak National Observatory for use in several real time control and data acquisition systems currently being assembled. Its principal feature is a stack register which serves as a work area to assemble the information needed for a CAMAC cycle. The stack has sixteen levels which serve to preserve the existing status under interrupt conditions without requiring special software routines. A priority interrupt system with 23 levels and a direct memory access channel are also included. The system is self contained, needing no auxiliary support within the host computer. Highlights of the structure and general characteristics are described below."
  "A two-processor data acquisition and analysis system incorporating CAMAC is discussed. The processors are a conventional mini-computer and a micro-programmed I/O processor which effects a programmable interface between the mini-computer and CAMAC. Hardware-software design considerations for a multi-processor acquisition and analysis system and procedural level computer/CAMAC interaction are also discussed."
 "During the past several years, considerable momentum has been achieved in the development of standards, codes and guides for application to equipment in nuclear power generating stations. Common to all of this work is a number of \"classification schemes\" to identify the types or functions of equipment to which the various standards apply. The parent organizations responsible for preparing the standards represent a number of different disciplines and philosophical backgrounds, with the result that the equipment definitions and the various classification schemes are diverse and in some cases they overlap. The purpose of this paper is to review the variety of classification schemes which are encountered in the regulatory process and in the standards writing groups for nuclear power generating stations, and to summarize the efforts of the American Nuclear Society BWR Criteria Subcommittee pertaining to equipment classification and design requirements for boiling water reactors."
"In the past two years, there has been a significant increase in the demand for services in quality and reliability assurance for the nuclear power industry. Most of this demand has stemmed from the quality assurance systems requirements that are being imposed by the AEC for construction permits and licenses for operation of these plants and the resultant imposition of similar quality system requirements on sub-contractors and suppliers. There is, however, significant effort being expended by industry to have industrially approved documents used instead of the AEC documents. The result is confusion and uncertainty. There are currently at least five documents in use for quality system requirements. These are: Mil - Q - 9858 A AEC - 10 CFR 50, Appendix B ASME - Section III, Article NA 4000 ANSI - N - 45.2 AEC - RDTF2-2T These docunents have many things in common and also some differences. The purpose of this paper is to review the roles of the aforementioned documents and report their salient points-both similarities and differences. The question of developing a single quality system that will economically satisfy any one or all five of these documents is dealt with and a plan for effectively accomplishing this, whether the company has five or five thousand employees, is explained."
 "The standard design for all advanced High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (HTGR) nuclear power plants includes an integrated instrumentation system using a digital-computer-based Data Acquisition and Processing (DAP) system. This integrated-systems approach to instrumentation and controls improves plant availability and efficiency of operation. The computer system does not perform any control or safety functions but audits both of these functions automatically and independent of the operator and the plant protection system. The DAP system informs the operator whether the limits exceeded are safety or operation related. In addition to monitoring the important safety and control parameters, checking alarm limits, summarizing normal values, and formatting useful operator messages, the DAP system analyzes and evaluates the plant operating status. Operator error is reduced because the operator is less occupied with routine data analysis and therefore has more time to observe and direct his attention to the overall plant operation. The operator can readily obtain instantaneous information in one central location, and thus the need for roving data collection is minimized. This paper briefly describes the DAP system configuration, system hardware, software, and major functions. The man/machine interface during plant operation is described in more detail. The paper concludes with the suggestion that this system is adaptable to the evolution of control philosophy."
  "The current General Electric Boiling Water Reactor process computer is a conventionally architectured, medium sized, monolithic system based upon the GE-PAC* 4010. The system performs scan, log, and alarm functions, as well as some rather complicated nuclear steam supply and turbine generator performance calculations. However, over the years, the G.E. system designers in San Jose have become aware of both the limitations of the monolithic architecture as applied to the rapidly growing nuclear applications as well as the recent tremendous advances in computer hardware technology. What has emerged is the concept of a distributed computer control system primarily designed for the G.E. BWR, but also ideally suited for other applications. Built around a high speed common data base memory, the distributed system yields a giant improvement in terms of overall computer system modularity, software simplicity, versatility, price/performance ratio, availability, and functional capability. The G.E. design is built around two major changes in philosophy in terms of applying process computers to an application: (1) Force the computer architecture to fit the man and the application, and (2) Increase the hardware content and complexity whenever it is consistent with reducing the software complexity and cost."
"This paper describes the experience and the operation results of computer processing at the EL4 heavy water power plant, in particular: 1) about the hardware, a classification of the most characteristic failures and the unavailability time, 2) about the software, a remodeling of some basic programs, 3) about the plant operation, a remodeling of some automation programs as a result of process and mechanical equipment modifications and evolution of the operation philosophy."
"This paper describes the use of computers in the PHENIX fast breeder power plant and the philosophy which induced: 1) The design of two safety computers specially for fuel element plugging detection in order to initiate reactor scram. The organization of calculations, the redundancy of sensors and computers are detailed. 2) The design of two computers for plant data processing, to develop adequate computer operation procedures and man-machine communications, to classify the data processes. Application of CRT for alarm and plant data displays appears to be of great help for man-machine dialogue."
"The proliferation of nuclear power plants and their siting nearer to populated areas has demanded ever increasing reliability in their safety systems. Our industry has met these demands in design and construction areas through separations criteria, redundant systems and high level quality assurance programs. Design and construction reliability, however, is only as good as its continued verification of operational integrity. This places the continued and real burden of testing on the operating utilities. The complexity of these separated/redundant systems makes this testing not only more difficult, but more necessary and therefore more frequently conducted. This discussion explores the potential use of dedicated self-checking mini-computers to reduce the operating manpower requirements to conduct this testing, to minimize the test intervals and to enhance overall safety system reliability."
"This paper describes the application of a Remote Multiplexing System specifically designed for use in nuclear power plants, to greatly reduce the amount of instrumentation and control wiring. Adapting a plant to direct digital control at some future date is also discussed. The criteria for such a system are discussed. Extreme care in system and equipment design is required to provide the reliability, environmental durability, insensitivity to electrical transients and immunity to common mode failure."
"A gamma spectrometer system with sodium iodide and germaniumlithium drifted detectors and digital minicomputer was selected for use at the Brunswick Steam Electric Plant. The equipment selection was based on the effluent reporting requirements of AEC Safety Guide 21 - MEASURING AND REPORTING OF EFFLUENTS FROM NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS. General software routines were not available for this specific application. A functional description of the software has been defined and the specific routines are in development. These routines automate radionuclide analysis and report generation for the nuclear power plant technician. The operating objective of the gamma spectrometer system is to routinely provide a detailed radionuclide analysis of samples, using a minimum of wet chemistry, to meet the requirements of plant Technical Specifications while operated by the plants' Radiation Control and Test Technicians. Changes in in-plant and effluent analysis requirements during the post two years have made existing equipment of that time inadequate for the needs of today and the future. The minicomputer based gamma spectrometer system provides the maximum amount of flexibility available today to meet tomorrow's demands."
"Combustion Engineering recently completed installation of a pressurized water reactor simulator at its Windsor, Connecticut engineering facility. This simulator duplicates the control room of Baltimore Gas & Electric Company's Calvert Cliffs Unit #1. Principal characteristics of the plant are given in Appendix A. The simulator was designed and constructed by Singer Company, Simulation Products Division. The justification for training simulators and their application to operator training have been covered by other authors. This paper is oriented toward increasing the general understanding of the problems involved in developing a training simulator. While a training simulator has characteristics in common with system simulation for design analysis, there are problems which are unique to the training simulator. The table below shows its dual capabilities as a simulator and as a trainer."
"The refueling system for the Fort St. Vrain Nuclear Generating Station uses a small digital computer for automatic control to handle approximately 3000 fuel and reflector blocks which constitute the reactor core. The computer has complete control of the handling mechanism, which has four freedoms of motion, and also logs information concerning all fuel movements for inventory purposes. Since safety is a prime consideration in equipment associated with a nuclear power plant, a combination of hardware and software protection monitors provides for fail-safe operation. Operating experience has proved that automatic control of the fuel handling process is approximately five times faster than manual operation with the same machine. In addition, operator errors are eliminated and an accurate log of all fuel movements is recorded."
"Nuclear power plants are progressing rapidly to provide reliable and inexpensive power in increasingly large blocks. These power plants are an extensively engineered product involving a complex array of systems and subsystems, all of which must be monitored and controlled. The complexity of these systems and their interface to other systems is now placing a severe burden on the operator. The operator of today must interface with thousands of control and display devices to monitor and control the plant. He must continuously monitor and analyze, on a selective basis, numerous variables in order to effectively control the plant. During abnormal operations, the operator must assimilate information from the vast amount of data available to him and correctly interpret and respond to the abnormal condition within a short period of time. The human capability to perform under these circumstances is rapidly becoming a critical factor in plant operations and control systems design. The General Electric Company, having been in the forefront of nuclear plant control systems design since the introduction of nuclear power to industry, has recognized this and for the past several years has been developing advanced control systems to improve the operator's interface with the plant. This paper describes the first generation of our advanced control systems and previews the next generation of designs. It discusses the design criteria used, a detailed description, and the associated benefits and advantages of what the General Electric Company calls the Nuclenet Control Complex."
 "The design of linear accelerator (linac) cavities necessitates the field solution of axisymmetric electromagnetic resonators. Mathematically this involves the solution of the one-component vector Helmholtz equation in cylindrical coordinates subject to boundary conditions which are dictated by the physics of the electromagnetic field problem. In this paper it is shown how the high-order polynomial, triangular, finite element method can be applied to field calculation in linac cavities of arbitrary longitud - inal cross section."
"A general proof, for the ß degradation equation in displacement producing radiation environments is presented. The proof is straightforward for the base component of damage. An extension of the proof encompasses damage in the base emitter field region to the extent it can be related to the emitter time constant. The derivation assumes a significant post-radiation common emitter current gain (ß > 3)."

 "The CAMAC instrumentation system developed by the ESONE Committee of European laboratories has been endorsed by the U. S. AEC NIM Committee as a dataway system complementary to the NIM (Nuclear Instrument Module) system. CAMAC is described in a general way in this introductory paper which is followed by papers that discuss the system in greater detail. This paper is an updated version of the introductory paper that appeared in the April 1971 IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science."
"The basic purpose of CAMAC is to provide a standardized method for transferring data and control information between instrurrentation modules and a digital controller. CAMAC encompasses both a hardware standard for housing the modular components of a system and an electrical and logical standard for the control \"language\" used to effect the information transfer. The CAMAC specification contains the formally stated rules for hoth of these aspects of CAMAC. This paper concentrates on the control language and describes some of its features and uses in a less formal way than in the specification, and therefore may be useful as an introduction to the subject. Other papers in this series consider other aspects of CAMAC, including its place in the context of instrumentation systems, hardware aspects, signal standards, the Branch Highway, and coupling to computers and control systems. Here, the scope is limited to the process of information interchange within the CAMAC crate. This is a revised version of a paper previously publishled. Since the first version was published, a revised version of the CAMAC specification has been issued. This present paper is based only on the revised specification. Information on the differences between the original and revised CAMAC specifications is available."
"This paper presents a short summary and description of the CAMAC Branch Highway. The purpose of the branch and some of its characteristics are explained. Certain operational sequences are described in detail. The paper is intended to serve as an introduction to the CAMAC Branch Highway Specification, and is one of a series of papers on CAMAC topics. It is a revised version of a paper previously published. Since the first version was published, a revision of the branch highway specification has been issued. The present paper is based only on the revised specification. Information on the differences between the original and revised specifications is available."
  "The typical CAMAC system is operated in conjunction with a small computer. In the usual case, the computer acts as a repository for data generated by CAMAC, and also controls and directs the CAMAC operations. This paper discusses some of the aspects of the hardware interface, and also some of the interaction between the computer and the CAMAC system."
"Since most CAMAC systems include computers, the generation and maintenance of computer programs may represent a substantial fraction of the effort involved in assembling a CAMAC system. The effort involved can be reduced if standard software can be used, but the generality of the hardware and the variety of computers and interfaces make the production of efficient, general software difficult. Some of the problems and some general approaches to them are discussed below. The NIM Software Working Group has been working on a set of FORTRAN subroutines for use with CAMAC systems. Though the effort is incomplete, it has reached a stage where its implementation is feasible and will prove useful. The working group has therefore concluded that it should be published in this tutorial issue to make it available to prospective users."
"Is everyone going to use CAMAC? Probably not. Does CAMAC represent all the latest thinking in data handling? Again the answer is no. However, one must remember that the time from conception to delivery of a computer makes it partially obsolete before it is ever used. This is the price of progress. A similar gestation time was inevitable for CAMAC. If we were to begin today, CAMAC would be different, but at this point in time we are glad we don't have to start over again. CAMAC has proved its worth in many experimental research situations. Also CAMAC is dynamic; as new technology beccmes available it will obviously be incorporated into the system. Now is the time to take it to the industrial market place. The predominant use of CAMAC should be in industrial data-acquisition and control environments."
"The problem of optimally controlling the power level changes of a nuclear reactor for a wide variety of cost functions is considered. Admissible performance indexes are arbitrary functions of the power level and its derivative as well as of the reactivity input and its derivative. The proposed method is based on the use of optimal second-order models, the parameters of which are computed on-line to produce piece-wise approximations to the response of the plant. While the controller parameters, which give optimal performance for the model, result in only a suboptimal system response, the deviations between the two converge rapidly to zero. The proposed technique is illustrated by computing the responses of a power reactor for integral quadratic cost functions, as well as for least pth and minimax criteria. The results indicate that near-optimal performance may be achieved under conditions encountered in practice."
"In this paper, control systems with multiple transport lags are analyzed using the parameter-plane and parameter-space methods. A chemical system operated for the automatic control of a nuclear reactor is considered, and a comparison of the result with current literature is given."
"The use of a perfect relay in the automatic control of a coupled-core reactor results in an undesirable limit-cycle, regardless of the reactivity rate demand. In order to enable the use of a perfect relay, artificial dither is inserted into the control system loop. This paper presents the principle and establishes the nature of the stabilization signal that eliminates possible limit-cycle in the system. An example is presented to illustrate the procedure, and a digital computer simulation results are given."
"Second generation operational amplifiers, which are widely used in space applications, show considerable sensitivity to electron irradiation at fluences corresponding to unshielded long term operation in the earth synchronous orbit. Surface and bulk radiation effects are described for different device types. It is shown that the surface effects are very process dependent. Guidelines are given for the selection of reasonably radiation resistant components."
"A straightforward (pedestrian) approximation scheme is applied to a transient electromagnetic field problem associated with a finite-length cylindrical cavity bounded by perfectly conducting walls. The cavity is filled with a homogeneous lossy dielectric material. Analytic expressions for the zeroth-and first-order terms of the perturbation solution for each of the relevant components of the electric and magnetic fields generated by an axially propagating current pulse are presented. Results obtained for various sample problems are examined and comparisons with the exact solutions are highlighted. The adequacy and limitations of such an approximation scheme are discussed, and the errors associated with ignoring the displacement and conduction currents are made evident."

     "Accelerators and accelerator technology has rapidly expanded into Medicine and Industry. The 2500 accelerators in the USA, which represent about 2/3 the worldwide census of accelerators are primarily devoted to practical applications, although the major impact on technology has been produced by a relatively few excellent facilities. Approximately 80% of the current accelerators in the USA are found to be in medical and industrial use representing a capital investment by industry of $200,000,000. Of greater importance is their impact on the treatment of cancer, and the improvement or creation of better products for industrial and consumer use. The development of new accelerators and techniques are required in order to insure continuing benefits to the public."
 "Superconducting rf electron accelerator prototypes have been operated at Stanford University and at the University of Illinois. Many of the beam performance goals for emittance, current, energy resolution and stability have been achieved. Lower-than-expected accelerating gradients have necessitated the reevaluation of the energy objectives. Recirculation of the electron beam through the superconducting linacs will, however, increase the effective accelerating gradient."
"The work on superconducting proton and heavy ion accelerators will be reviewed. The helix seems to be an adequate structure for low velocity particles. For energies above 15 MeV/N other types of accelerating structures may be used. Superconducting Nb helices were developed at several places. A maximum gradient of 2.8 MV/m witha Q of 2.109 has been obtained recently in Karlsruhe with a Q/2 Nb helix at 90 MHz. First proton acceleration in superconducting helical structures indicates the status of the new technology."
"A computer program which simulates the multiplications of electrons in cavities using Monte Carlo techniques has been developed. This electron multiplication program has provided an understanding of the x-ray energy spectrum produced by cavities and of x-ray photographs taken of cavities at high fields. Also, this simulation has predicted two new effects: (1) an electron avalanche multiplication effect which is non-resonant in nature (as opposed to the well known resonant electron multi-pactoring), and (2) electrons produced in this way tend to form a low energy (on the order of 10 eV) electron cloud near the cavity major diameter."
"A superconducting S-band RF particle separator is under construction which will be used at the CERN 300 GeV proton synchrotron. It is foreseen to separate particles up to at least 30 GeV/c momentum. We give a summary of quality factors-(Q) and peak magnetic field (Hp) measurements on several test-deflectors. A sequence of surface treatments including electropolishing, anodizing and an UHV-annealing around 1850°C allowed us to obtain in a reliable way Q- and Hp-values well above our minimum requirements (5×108 and 310 Oe respectively). The highest values hitherto obtained for the (high-field) Q and Hp are 4.3×109 and 510 Oe corresponding to a mean deflecting field of 3.3 MV/m. The effect of repeated cooling cycles under vacuum and exposure to clean air or methanol was found not to be critical for our range of Q and Hp. The surface resistance depends linearly on an external dcmagnetic field whereas the dependence on the RF field level is much more complicated. With our surface treatment and our deflecting modes multipacting presents no problem. Breakdowns are nearly always caused by magnetic fields. The frequency tuners foreseen are described. Fine and coarse tuning will be done by separated tuners. They have been tested successfully up to Q-values of 109 and peak fields of 390 Oe. Finally a computer program has been written allowing the calculation of multiperiodic deflector modes. An exemple is shown and compared with a π-mode for uniform periodic structures."
"The influence of several surface preparation techniques like electropolishing, chemical edging, anodizing and UIIV-heat treatment on both the Q-value and the peak RF fields have been studied in a welded S-band cavity having large beam tubes. Peak magnetic fields up to 650 Oe at a Q-value of 8×1010 in the TE011-mode and peak surface electric fields of 25 MV/m at Q = 7×109 in the TM010-mode have been obtained. Simultaneous measurements of the mean free path in the surface layer of the cavity permit to calculate Hc1. The results indicate that Hc1 is no limitation for the magnetic fields achievable in RF-cavities. This makes type-II-superconductors like Nb3Sn interesting for practical applications at high frequencies."
"Some different surface preparation techniques are applied to TE011- and TM010-X-band cavities machined from solid niobium. The topography of as prepared surfaces is demonstrated by micrographs. A critical magnetic flux density of 160 mT was obtained with a single piece TM010-cavity."
"An electronic system for the control of the effects of RF frequency oscillations caused by mechanical vibrations in a superconducting helix are described. A combination of frequency modulation and amplitude modulation is used to lock the phase of a self-excited accelerating structure to that of a controlling master oscillator. The system has been used successfully during beam acceleration with a superconducting helix."
"A prototype superconducting-helix accelerator is described and design considerations are discussed. The results obtained during 120 hours of beam acceleration are given. These include a wealth of practical engineering experience, the demonstration of stable operation with external phase control, and measurements of various kinds of accelerator-physics data."
"An electron beam of several microamperes has been accelerated by a 6 foot 1.3 GHz superconducting niobium linac to 3.5 MeV on its first pass. It has been returned to the linac for two additional passes with energy gains around 3 MeV per pass to a final energy of 9.5 MeV. The recirculation is accomplished by means of two uniform field magnets placed at each end of the accelerating section in a racetrack microtron geometry which will accommodate the return beams for six passes through the linac."
 "A cryogenic vacuum pump, designed to lower the base pressure from 2 × 10-6 Torr to 3 × 10-7 Torr was installed in the Bevatron in February 1972. The ~ 11,000 ft3 vacuum volume contains > 100,000 ft2 of outgassing surface and is pumped with twenty-four 32-in. oil diffusion pumps. Nine cryopanels (90 ft total) were distributed around the 360-ft circumference, increasing pump capacity by 400,000 l/s for condensibles at 80°K and 140,000 l/s at 20°K. Benefits include faster pumpdowns, improved beam stability, and higher intensities."
"The study of S-Band superconducting niobium cavities is being carried out for application to long-pulse rf beam separators in the momentum range of the AGS, whereas, X-Band frequencies are being considered for the NAL accelerator. Results for a 5-cell S-band prototype are: a peak field of 410 G, corresponding to an equivalent deflecting field of over 2 MV/m, and a loss improvement factor of 2 × 105. The fabrication and post-fabrication treatments are described. Perturbation measurements to determine deflector parameters are summarized. A new type of mode stabilizer is suggested. A 7-cell X-Band deflector is under construction."
"Experience has shown that superconducting accelerator cavity performance improves as the operating frequency rises. To use this effect to advantage in an electron synchrotron one must develop cavities of aperture large enough to provide the necessary phase space admittance and of such a configuration as to avoid problems with lost particles and synchrotron radiation in the orbit plane. The development of such a cavity, open in the mid-plane, is described and test results given."
"Electron loading has been investigated in super-conducting niobium L- and S-band TM010 mode single-cell cavities at high field by observing the x-radiation which electrons accelerated by the RF fields produce on collisison with a cavity wall. This x-radiation has been studied for various cavity lengths, cavity resonant frequencies, and vacuum and surface conditions. Also, electron loading has been found to produce regenerative excitation of higher modes in both L- and S-band cavities."
"Measurements at 8.6 GHz on TM mode superconducting niobium cavities have been carried out at SLAC in an attempt to establish definitive conditions for reproducibly attaining high peak electric and magnetic fields and high residual Q's. Four cavities, processed by techniques which insure the presence of an oxide layer on the niobium surface before final high temperature outgassing, have given peak magnetic fields exceeding 1000 G and corresponding peak electric fields in excess of 56 MV/m. From this and related experience it is speculated that, in order to achieve high peak fields, carbon present on the niobium surface must be removed through the formation of volatile compounds with oxygen or fluorine during high temperature processing. Data are also presented on the effect on rf properties of exposure at room temperature to various gases. Measurements on anodized cavities are briefly discussed."
"Measurements of the additional losses due to frozen-in magnetic flux have been carried out between 80 and 413 MHz and 2 and 5 GHz. In difference to the results in the GHz-region a not expected stronger temperature and rf-field dependence occured in the 100 MHz region."
"Resonant frequency of superconducting radio frequency (RF) cavities, which are used in linear accelerator research, may rapidly shift over many bandwidths because of vibration. In this paper an all electrical method is analyzed which can correct for these frequency shifts. The method depends upon the use of a voltage-variable reactance to control frequency. The general characteristics of control are first determined. Power distribution in the system is then found."
"Further results on electronic tuning of superconducting accelerator structures are given. A new phase control system is reported, where the absolute cavity phase is controlled by a variable reactance using a PIN diode system, while the cavity is locked to a voltage controlled oscillator."
"A cryogenic system has been designed for cooling ~1000 superconducting magnets associated with the proposed \"energy-doubler\" at the National Accelerator Laboratory. This paper reports on design parameters, cooling concepts, heat transfer and pressure drops. Even though in final design changes are anticipated, the attempt in this work is to complete a refrigeration design which would accomplish the cooling necessary for the energy doubler magnets."
 "A combination of dacron sail cloth and mylar film is used for large vacuum windows in secondary beams at the Bevatron. The dacron cloth provides the structural strength and the mylar film provides the gas barrier. Windows of this type have three principal advantages over plain mylar of equivalent strength: 1. Safer, will not catastrophically fail; 2. Forms square corners; 3. Less dense. This paper discusses the development, testing, and fabrication techniques of several such windows in use."
"This valve is used to reduce the gas loading on the vacuum system of a multipulsing H- ion source. It is a self-aligning chopper type. A mechanism of this construction assures the reilability required for an ion source of this nature. The reliability of this mechanism is due to the fact that the disc of the chopper is rotated at a relatively slow constant velocity and no wearing parts of the assembly are subjected to the extreme vacuum atmosphere. The entire valve assembly is very simple in construction. It is driven with a synchronous motor to keep it in step with the accelerating frequency. Vacuum integrity is maintained with the use of a ferromagnetic fluid coupling as part of the drive system. All bearings, motors, and drive mechanisms are external to the vacuum cavity."
"A 1 1/2 in isolation gate valve was designed and built to prevent vacuum vessel letup to atmosphere in the event of ion source component failure. To assure no effect on existing beam geometry, the valve thickness was held to 1 1/8 in. The valve gate consists of two disks separated by a short length of bellows. One disk, moving with the expansion and contraction of the bellows, contains the gasket in its outer face. The other disk contains a leak path from its edge to the interior of the bellows. The shaft is welded to the disk containing the leak path and exposes the leak path, through its hollow center, to the exterior of the valve housing. Evacuation of the bellows through the center of the shaft permits linear motion of the valve, by manual push or pull, to closed or open position. Letup of the bellows' interior to atmosphere holds the valve gate in the position it was placed manually."
"A method is described for constructing and installing solid metal liners inside epoxy filled synchrotron magnets."
"Circular deflectors lined with boron nitride, beryllia, and alumina are studied for application to ultrahigh-energy beam separators. These deflectors are designed at an aperture of 1 cm2 at 5.6 and 8.5 GHz. The attenuation length, transverse shunt impedance, and group velocity are presented in graphs."
"The state of negative ion technology at this time is undergoing a substantial transition. Beams have been produced from a large number of species of the periodic table and ways can be seen which will allow almost any species to be accelerated successfully. Because of the great usefulness of negative ions, I believe that a National effort should be made to exploit the possibilities of these sources by developing the calculational techniques which we described earlier, and by the development of various types of negative ion sources."
"A tandem-acceleration extended stationary arc duoplasmatron used for 1-Hz injection into the ANL booster is undergoing further development for 30-Hz operation. A 200-μs, 50-MeV H- beam of at least 4 mA at 30 Hz will be required by the booster in its final development phase. To meet this requirement and to offset losses occurring in the linac and in the 750-keV and 50-MeV beam lines, the source must provide about 10 mA of H-ions. The present source produces negative ion currents of this order but the H-component is typically only 50% of the total beam; the remainder of the beam consists of ions with mass numbers in the neighborhood of 17. Source design will be discussed and data will be presented for typical operating conditions on the test bench and in the 75-keV terminal of the preaccelerator. Physical and chemical properties of materials which affect their suitability for use in pulsed ion sources as load-bearing structural materials, as functional components, and as vacuum walls will also be discussed."
"This paper describes a method for increasing the intensities for heavy ion beams accelerated in isochronous cyclotrons at high harmonics (h≥5) of the orbit frequency. Normally, only small intensities are obtained at high harmonics because of the low effective accelerating voltage between the ion source and the puller electrode. We have developed and tested a dc ion extraction system for the Oak Ridge Isochronous Cyclotron (ORIC). Use of the dc extraction system has increased beams of 4OAr3+ on the 5th harmonic and 2ONel+ on the 7th harmonic from nanoamperes to microamperes."
 "An economical means for the production of high energy, high intensity beams of a variety of heavy-ions is to utilize the existing LBL SuperHilac as an injector for the existing LBL Bevatron. Particle energies from 0.25 to 2.6 GeV/nucleon will be realized. The description of this facility, which will be in operation in late 1973, includes the general arrangements, the modest changes to each accelerator, beam transport line design, and a new bio-medical experimental area."
"The design of a flexible linear accelerator for heavy ions is described. An array of short, independently phased helix resonators is used with a 4 MV injector having a positive ion source."
"A large electrostatic tandem accelerator has been designed to provide a nuclear structure facility in Britain. The machine is intended to operate initially at a terminal potential of 20 MV, with subsequent upgrading to 30 MV. The design of the facility is described, including the choice of main parameters, the beam optics, column construction, charging system, instrumentation and buildings. An extensive development programme on high voltage problems is being carried out."
"The accelerators for the new National Heavy-Ion Laboratory (NHL) being planned at Oak Ridge will provide beams of all ions from helium to uranium with energies ranging from 100 MeV/u for light ions to 10 MeV/u for the heaviest ions accelerated. The heart of the proposed accelerator system is a large 4 sector isochronous cyclotron of the separated sector type with an energy rating of 440 q2/A MeV. Ions are to be injected into the large cyclotron from either a large tandem electrostatic acclerator or from the Oak Ridge Isochronous Cyclotron (ORIC). The ORIC will generally suffice as the injector up to the mass 160-180 range, beyond which use of the tandem is necessary. Beam intensities will range from 1013 ions/sec for 100 MeV/u oxygen to ~2 × 1012/sec for 10 MeV/u uranium ions. The beam emittance is expected to be less than 10 mm-mrad and the energy spread less than 0.1%. The large cyclotron uses auxiliary RF accelerating cavities operating at twice the main RF frequency to flattop the effective accelerating voltage waveform to thus increase the phase acceptance and reduce the energy spread of the beams."
"We have made an initial computer study of a recycling method for increasing the final energy of heavy-ion beams from ORIC. The system involves simultaneous acceleration of two beams. A first beam originating either in an ion source or external injector is accelerated, extracted, and reinjected in a higher charge state obtained by means of a foil located between the turns of the first-pass beam. For example, with a 20 MV tandem injecting into ORIC the energy for 208Pb after the first pass would be 1.9 or 2.3 MeV/u and after the second pass 5.2 or 6.3 MeV/u depending on the injection charge. The requirements of this scheme are 1) sufficient dee voltage to override the differing mass increase factors of the 2 beams; 2) good beam quality and accelerator stability to insure spatial separation of orbits; 3) an allmagnetic extraction system to assure identical paths for the 2 beams; and 4) relatively standard external beam separation and reinjection equipment."
"High Energy Heavy-Ion Beams have become a standard operational feature of the Bevatron. A diver-sified experimental program using these beams complement the traditional proton-physics program, and at present accounts for about one-quarter of the Bevatron operation time. Beams of ion species up to mass number 20 (neon), and with intensities up to 108 particles per pulse for carbon, are available on target in the extracted beam channel. Initial heavy-ion operation began a year-and-one-half ago and for the most part utilized existing Bevatron features and capabilities. Acceleration of ion species heavier than helium-ions, however, required the adaptation of a side-extracted PIG ion-source to the Bevatron pre-injector. The immediate success of this development effort and the concomitant demand for experimental beam time motivated an improvement program to provide higher beam intensities, improved beam control and monitoring, and closed-loop beam control for intensities as low as 106 particles per pulse. Single particle beam dynamics has been invest igated. Predicted operation settings based on these studies are found to be close to actual running parameters. Losses due to recomibination are well explained with existing theories for single electron capture."
"An ion source system employing mass selection has been developed for use in the terminal of an accelerator. The beam from a duoplasmatron is accelerated to 40 keV and focused by an einzel lens through a 200 permanent magnet inflector. A beam waist is formed at a 6.35 mm rejection aperture located on the acceleration axis. Dispersion is sufficient to provide a proton beam of greater than 99% purity. Proton currents up to 7 mA were obtained during bench testing. Performance demonstrations on the Dynamitron accelerator at the University of Birmingham have shown proton beam power in excess of 6 kw at energies from 2 to 3 MeV."
"The design and performance of helix resonators operating at room temperature are described. The resonators are analogous to λ/2 transmission lines shorted at both ends, and they oscillate at a frequency of 50 MHz. If slightly flattened 1/4 in. diam tubing is used to construct the helix, the resonators combine high shunt impedance with adequate coolant flow for high duty factor operation. Calculated and measured shunt impedances for different resonator phase velocities are given. The highest measured shunt impedance was 31 MΩ/m, for a resonator with a phase velocity equal to 0.04 c. For a steadily applied field of 1.25 MV/m, and a water pressure of 1500 psi, various helix designs have cooling water temperature rises of 10-22 C. Two coupling arrangements which provide 50 ohm resistive input impedance at resonance are described. The resonant frequency can be tuned by a threaded 3 in. diam copper plug mounted in the cylindrical wall. A facility for testing resonators at full power is described."
 "The NAL accelerator achieved design energy of 200 GeV on March 1, 1972. Since that time, the main accelerator has operated as high as 400 GeV and regularly operates at 300 GeV. The highest intensity to date has been 1.8 × 1012 protons per pulse at 300 GeV. This beam has been extracted from the accelerator using a half-integral resonance system to give a slow spill over approximately 250 ms. The extracted beam is presently being split and sent into three different experimental areas. In addition, a target area in the main accelerator enclosure allows experiments to be done on the internal, circulating beam."
"The former Cornell 2.2-GeV electron synchrotron has been moved to Argonne, modified, and recommissioned as a developmental booster injector for the Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS). The machine uses H- stripping injection to obtain circulating intensities normally impossible to achieve with conventional proton injection techniques. Results of tests performed to date are discussed in this report."
"A 590 MeV ring cyclotron, using a 72 MeV cyclotron injector (Philips design), for a cw proton beam of 100 μA at 50 MHz is under construction at the Swiss Institute for Nuclear Research (SIN), near Villigen, Switzerland. While the mechanical assembly approaches completion, tests of sub-sections of the machine are being carried out. A 1/4 ring section, containing internal elements, was investigated under operating conditions. Results are presented and discussed."
"Some of the design problems peculiar to TRIUMF are discussed. These problems arise from the large size of the magnet (4000 tons) and low average magnetic field which in turn are required by the necessity of avoiding electric stripping of the H- ions. Gas stripping of the ions requires the low operating pressure of 4 × 10-8 torr. Problems arising from the acceleration on the 5th harmonic of the ion frequency and their relation to the unusually tight tolerances on the position of the accelerating electrodes are discussed. Some preliminary results of the magnetic field measurements are presented."
"The Livermore cyclograaff facility has been operational for experimental use since October 1971. Accelerator development has concentrated upon production of proton beams with burst length and repetition rates suitable for fast neutron time-of-flight work. Average target currents exceeding 1μ A are now available in pulsed beam mode over the nominal 1-27 MeV range of the combined machines."
 "The CERN 800 MeV PSB consists of four synchrotrons stacked one on top of the other. The injector is the present 50 MeV CERN Proton Synchrotron (CPS) linac. Its beam is injected sequentially into the four rings via a vertical distribution system. Monoturn or multiturn injection of up to fifteen turns is available. After acceleration to 800 MeV, the four beams are ejected sequentially and brought to a common level by a recombination system. All twenty bunches are then transferred to the CPS, thus potentially increasing its intensity to 1013 p/p. Construction started in 1968, running-in on 1 May, 1972. Experiments on injection, acceleration, and transfer to the CPS were carried out whilst completing the installation of beam observation systems, debugging the interface to the IBM 1800 control computer, and bringing the software to operational standard. Closed orbit deviations are less than anticipated (only a few mm). Linear coupling and sum resonances were studied with a beam coasting at injection energy: they can be compensated with a small fraction of the available correction strength. Multiturn injection, RF trapping efficiency, acceleration, synchronization, ejection, and transfer to the CPS are described in their latest stage. At the end of the year the design intensity of 2.5 × 1012 p/p was reached in one ring."
"The present AGS status and recent performance results are described and details are given regarding the 200-MeV linac injector, multiturn injection, orbit improvements, intensity limitations and longitudinal effects, the bunched fast extraction, the \"shaving\" mode of fast extraction and the slow external beam switchyard development."
"During the first years of operation, primary emphasis was put on achieving reliability and stability. Of special note is the improvement in the slow extracted electron beams. More recently, installation of a \"flat top\" giving us an improvement of duty cycle from 4.5 % to 15.4 % (ΔE/E = ± 0.25 %) has motivated us to emphasize increase of beam intensity. Intensity dependant instabilities have been encountered, studied, and to some extent cured."
"Progress of work on the construction of the 224 cm. Variable Energy Cyclotron, being installed at Calcutta is described. The cyclotron, with maximum expected energies of 70 MeV protons, 65 MeV deuterons and 130 MeV alphas, follows the design of the 88\" cyclotrons at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and the Texas A & M University, with some modifications incorporated for facilitating indigenous fabrication and for improved performance. The yokes and yoke legs of the 250 tonne magnet have been cast and tested for composition and porosity. The machining of yokes, yoke legs and pole pieces is under way. The main coil winding has started. The trim and valley coils will be epoxy potted. The rf system, utilising the RCA 6949 oscillator tube, is a combination of a self-excited and a driven system. Power supply fabrication is nearing completion and two 89 cm diffusion pumps have been fabricated for the vacuum system. The building is in the final stages. Beam transport layout envisages three high intensity and six high resolution channels. A small 8k on-line computer is being planned. Various other facilities are also being planned."
"The main accelerator abort system is designed to dump the unwanted beam only around the abort system and to reduce the residual radioactivity around the accelerator. The system consists of a 9-ft long aluminum target, a pair of 20-ft long steel collimators, and a pair of fast bump magnets. The beam is aborted within a few milliseconds after the arrival of a trigger signal."
"The TRIUMF cyclotron includes seven major components requiring large industrial contracts: the magnet cores, coils, D. C. power supply, vacuum chamber, support structure, RF resonators and RF power supply. The first five components are discussed, together with actual performance data. The RF components have been described recentlyl and will be installed in the cyclotron in about two months. The costs of these components plus associated building, engineering and inspection fees are given."
 "This paper describes the 184-Inch Synchrocyclotron and some of the operational improvements incorporated into it in the last few years. The proton beam intensity has been increased a factor of 2 by relatively simple and inexpensive means. A new beam-stretching \"cee\" electrode has been installed; this increases the internal stretched beam by about a factor of 2. Radiation shielding has been added which simplifies the building and modifying of experimental caves as well as providing radiation protection. The radiation monitoring system has been improved. Handling gear has been developed which eases the difficulties encountered in handling the great variety of equipment involved in cyclotron operation. An internal-external quadrupole beam focusing system is now being developed that will increase the external beam by 30%. A new patient-positioning unit (ISAH) has been installed in the medical cave and is the subject of a separate paper at this conference."
 "A 250 cm pole diameter isochronous cyclotron is under construction for the Swiss Institute for Nuclear Research (S.I.N.) The design goal is described followed by a brief discussion of the machine."
"A racetrack microtron whose energy may be varied continuously from 4.5 to 18 MeV has been built at the University of Western Ontario, and has been operated to full energy. Electrons from an external electron gun are injected with an electrostatic inflector, and accelerated in a short sidecoupled linac section. The RF power delivered to the linac section can be varied by means of a power splitter, thus allowing the energy gain in the section to be adjusted continuously from 1.5 to 3 MeV. The accelerator can be operated in three different modes: single traversal of the linac section with a final beam energy of 1.5 to 3 MeV, n = 2 with three traversals of the linac covering the final energy range from 4.5 to 9 MeV and n = 1 with six traversals of the linac and a corresponding energy range of 9 to 18 MeV. The magnetic guide field consists of two 180° magnets with alternating high and low field regions. To satisfy the resonance conditions the average induction can be varied up to 0.6 T and the lengths of the drift space between the magnets can be adjusted by moving the pole pieces of the magnets."
 "Some peculiarities of the 76-GeV accelerator operation at intensities up to 2.5 × 1012 protons/pulse are being reported. Possible causes for increase of particle losses with beam intensity are discussed; besides the data on correction of some betatron oscillation resonances are presented."
"Proton beams of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (LNP, JINR) Dubna synchrocyclotron and of the proton synchrotron of the Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics (ITEP) Moscow have been used for medical and biological purposes since 1967. 58 patients in JINR and 163 in ITEP with various types of malignant tumors have been treated. Results of clinical research showed that use of high energy protons for treatment of malignant tumors is quite expedient and may serve as a good approach developing better means for irradiation in oncological therapy. Proposals for proton and meson beams at the JINR high intensity phasotron and for proton beams at the ITEP medical and biological center are discussed. The ITEP center will consist of 4 cabins for therapy and 2 cabins for radiobiological research, which will permit to treat ~ 100 patients per day."
 "A single-turn coil for fast electron ring compression and magnetic expansion acceleration was built. It combines a fast magnetic field rise (dBz/dt /injection = 3×109 G/s) for very fast resonance crossing (within less than 100 ns) with a smooth and weak expansion field (Br = 5 G, dBr/dr /spill out < 0.5 G/cm). The first experiments showed strong collective behaviour of the electron ring at particle numbers of Ne = 5 × 1012, mainly radial collective oscillations with the frequency (1 - νr) ωo, which could be suppressed by increasing the corresponding Landau damping coefficient."
"An overall view of ERA research plan in Japan is given. The system has a field emission electron gun producing several kA driven by a Marx and a Blumlein during some tens of nsec and a large vacuum chamber made of stainless steel into which the electron beam is injected and captured. The coils for compression are placed inside the chamber and produce a fast rising magnetic field. The electron ring has a final radius of about 2 cm and the energy of electrons should be about 10 Mev. Special attention is given to the theoretical and the experimental studies of the collective phenomena related to the ring stability just after the injection, the possibility and the efficiency of the acceleration of a charged bunch with an RF cavity, and other problems of the instabilities that may arise."
"The experiments on ERA in Karlsruhe are reviewed. A new compression coil system including devices for roll out, spill out and expansion acceleration is under construction. Two possible applications of a molecular beam source for heavy ion and cluster ion acceleration are proposed."
"High intensity electron beam experiments are in progress at electron energies varying from 100 keV to 2 MeV. The low energy machines are Marx generators, while the high energy one is an electron beam transformer accelerator , home made with some original technical solutions. Its electron energy is 2 MeV, current > 10 kA, pulse length 20 ns at a repetition rate of 10 pps. The purpose is injection in the ANEL - type electron ring accelerators, beam dynamics and plasma - beam interaction investigations. Several models of field emission di odes have been investigated by various diagnostic methods and beam pictures on various materials have been taken."
"The Hydra electron beam generator was designed to simrultaneously produce two 1 MV, 0.5 MA, 80 nanosecond electron beams that could be combined to form a single beam. The machine, undergoing final developmental tests, has generated a 0.5 MA, 1 MV peak electron beam from each line. This accelerator consists of a low-inductance Marx generator, two water-dielectric pulse-forming (PF) and impedance-transforming transmission lines and two low-inductance, high-current diodes. A description of the generator is presented along with developmental studies and initial testing data. The Hydra machine is based on accelerator principles described in the literature. The Marx generator is submerged in transformer oil and separated from the transmission line water by a lucite interface. The Marx charges each coaxial PF transmission line which is deionized water insulated to 3 MV in 0.9 microseconds. At peak voltage, a 3 MV SF6 spark gap electrically connects the 4 ohm PF line to the impedance transforming (4 ohm to 2 ohm) transmission line. The pulse is transmitted through this line to the single radial insulator diode. A 30 kilojoule, 100 nanosecond duration electron beam is formed by a cold cathode in each diode."
   "The final concept, engineering design, and present status of the University of Maryland ERA Project is reviewed. A hollow cylindrical electron beam is produced by an injector which was designed by W. Lupton and coworkers of the Naval Research Laboratory in collaboration with members of the Maryland ERA group (design values: maximum energy 5 MeV, peak current 20 kA, pulse width 20 ns). The hollow beam is compressed into a short ring via transmission through a cusped static magnetic field configuration. The laboratory housing the facility was ready in June, 1972, construction of the injector was completed in September. Testing of the injector and assembly of the cusp and compressor coil system began in October. A first electron beam was obtained on February 22. The main results of injector, diode, and magnetic field measurements are presented. Some problems and solutions are discussed and the methods for gas loading and ring trapping are described."
"A 120-MHz cavity and RF system were built to modulate the beam energy of the Astron electron accelerator by ±5%. The beam pulse has a rise time of 20 ns which initiates a transient in the cavity. We designed the cavity to limit the transient voltage in order to avoid sparking. The excitation problem was studied both experimentally and theoretically. We established design criteria that allowed us to couple an RF cavity to a high-current beam as easily as to the low-current beams of the usual research accelerators."
"An approximate analytical treatment is presented for the electric and magnetic self fields of a long rotating sheet beam between coaxial conductors. By suitable choice of the conductor radii and/or by apply ing a voltage between the conductors it is possible to shift the potential minimum to the major radius of the beam; the condition for this is derived. Expressions for the equilibrium fields and gradients and for the particle oscillation frequencies in various geometries are presented."
"An injector has been built at the University of Maryland which produces a hollow cylindrical beam of relativistic electrons. The design uses a low-impedance pulse generator and step-up, transmission-linetransformer to drive a high-impedance, field-emission electron gun. This paper reviews the design of the pulse generator and performance of the pressurized gas switches. The transformer and electron gun design is also described and results are given for the initial tests of the injector with a 2-MeV, 6-kA beam."
"The possibility of trapping an electron ring in the Maryland ERA by use of a few resistive wire loops was investigated numerically. It was found that a resistive wire of 45 ohm resistance and 404 nh self-inductance was able to stop electron rings of 1013 electrons with initial axial velocities up to ßzo = 0.05. A scheme, with two resistive wires and a small local mirror field, allowed the trapping and focusing of electron rings of small axial dimension. Electron rings with relatively large axial lengths were also studied."
  "Our experiments have demonstrated reasonably conclusively that electron beams in the 20-30 kA range at approximately 1 MeV can be focused into spots on the order of 1 mm in diameter or smaller to give electron beam densities as high as 2.7 MA/cm2. We have confirmed this measurement by several independent diagnostic techniques. We have also determined that the beam current is space charge limited and appears to follow the parapotential law Ip = R/d Iaγo ln[γo+(γo2-1)1/2] Since the critical current is only proportional to R/d · γo, the ratio of Idiode/Icritical (for a given R/d) will become larger at a rate ln[γo + (γo - 1)1/2. This strongly suggests that the beam will self focus even more intensely at higher voltages. A limited number of tests at 3.MeV have indicated beam core spots smaller than 1/2 mm, the smallest we have observed to date. Our tests imply that an extension to AURORA-size beams (12 MeV) is feasible and would result in dramatic increases in delivered power together with further reduction in beam area."
"We have developed a diode system with an insulated anode and rear target that operates in vacuum and produces 4 × 1010 neutrons per pulse. The system forms a pinch discharge that ejects a cluster of collectively accelerated ions that attain full energy in 7 cm. Target neutron data and activation analysis with multiple foils show that pulses of 1014 protons with energy up to 15 MeV have been achieved. Experiments with electrode materials and diode geometry have lead to large improvements in focusing and ion beams have been propagated 8 ft in vacuum. The presence of high-energy carbon ions indicates that the pinch has the capability of forming and accelerating multiple ionized high-Z ions."
"A description is given of the status and performance of the AGS multiturn injection system. Experimental results are presented and compared with analytical predictions. Details are given concerning on-line computer emittance-acceptance matching and multiturn stacking in either the \"horizontal only\" mode or \"horizontal-vertical\" mode. In addition, a description is given of specific components such as the \"horizontal-vertical\" inflector and the emittance measurement device."
 "Beam from successive cycles of the 15-Hz booster synchrotron is stacked end to end in the main synchrotron with constant magnetic field. Beam already injected into the main ring is held in stationary rf buckets, and the rest field is determined by the circulating beam. To capture beam from subsequent booster cycles into the empty buckets in the main ring, the phase and frequency of the rf beam bunches in the booster are locked to the main ring rf system before beam is transferred. The magnetic fields in the booster and the main ring are regulated separately and tuned for the correct orbit radii and particle momentum. The azimuth of the beam circulating in the main ring is monitored by counting main ring rf cycles, and the beam transfer system is timed to inject beam from successive booster cycles in the correct sequence around the main-ring circumference."
  "IKO has recently obtained approval of its proposal to build a high duty factor linear accelerator. Main characteristics of this machine: 500 MeV at 2½% and 250 MeV at 10% d.f. R.F. power is to be obtained from 12 klystrons (100 kW av., 1-6 MW peak). A prototype modulator has been constructed. It consists of 48 modules, each of which is a printed circuit 2 kV line-type (50 μs) modulator. Each module feeds a primary winding of a special pulse transformer, in order to supply the 160 kV max. video pulses for the main klystron. The modulator lay-out allows the provision of video pulses, the amplitude of which can be regulated on a pulse to pulse basis with a special purpose processor. Cooling is achieved through the liquid vapor phase change of freon. Details of the system will be given together with first test results."
  "HVEM has become a useful method of research in metallurgy and biology. It was necessary to develop special electron accelerators for the supply of these high-voltage microscopes. In view of ac interference problems with air-insulated accelerators, a commercial 1 MV twin-tank accelerator was introduced in 1967. The voltage in this basic model was extended to 1.5 MV and stability improved from ± 1 x 10-5 to ± 1 x 10-6. The future requirements of the electron microscopists, which are directed towards even higher accelerating voltages and greater stability, can also be met by the principles of the symmetrical cascade generator and twin-tank accelerator."
"It has been clear for several years that some reasonably fundamental changes in the design of the High Voltage Engineering Corporation's MP tandem accelerator are essential if this machine is to operate reliably at terminal potentials that are above 10 MV. Although the original specifications for the accelerator only guaranteed 10MV, the expectation was high that the actual voltage limit would be near 13-15MV. In practice, the voltage levels have only recently been achieved at the HVE test facility and at the AECL laboratories at Chalk River, Canada."
"The use of H- negatively charged particles during injection into the ZGS booster requires the use of a stripping media to convert the particles to H+ for acceleration in the normal manner. This process of stripping is accomplished with the use of thin plastic foils placed in and out of the acceleration orbit with the use of a unique and novel mechanism."
  "The titanium vacuum chambers installed in the ZGS this past summer were equipped with PFW's. In this paper, the operation and monitoring of the windings used to flatten the guide field in the ZGS will be described. The physical and electrical characteristics of the system will be discussed along with a computer program which calculates the magnetic field shape in the vacuum chamber as a function of PFW current and other machine parameters."
 "In Part I we derive equations for the matched betatron phase space acceptance polygon for the nth turn and for the phase area swept out by the septum. A variable rate of shifting of the equilibrium orbit past the septum is considered with the object being to maximize the accelerated charge subject to a constraint on the permissible beam cross section at full energy. In Part II we describe spiral stacking-a method of systematic laying of successiveturn phase space ellipses along a logarithmic spiral in matched radial phase space; this results in uniformly dense packing of the beam with losses. The beam is injected above the median plane and placed along the spiral through a programmed tune shift and a programmed displacement of the equilibrium orbit."
"An analysis of a thermionic electron beam is presented and some deficiencies in the concepts of brightness and emittance are pointed out. Radiance and Richtstrahlwert are found to be better terms."
"This paper describes a pulsed ferrite inflector for fast injection of the 750 keV, 100% duty factor proton beam of the Chalk River High Current Test Facility (HCTF), into an emittance measuring device (EMD). Tests with a low voltage prototype of a pulser have shown that a flat pulse top can be achieved by grading a lumped delay line (serving as a pulse forming network) with small additional capacitors, and that the pulse fall time can be substantially reduced by a tail biter, which at a given time diverts the current from the magnet coil and at the same time opens the primary switch of the pulser."
"The construction of a solid state, voltage regulated energy discharge power supply with a dual output is briefly described. Each output operates at about 1800 V dc, and 7800 A peak. Charging voltage regulation, and set level, are obtained by means of a solid state relay at the primary site of the single phase high voltage rectifier transformer. This method yields a relatively inexpensive, simple system since it does not require phase control circuitry."
"The booster magnet power system operates 48 magnet modules for equilibrium orbit field control. The power system consists of four high current power supplies having a common thyristor firing control chassis. The power supplies were manufactured by Brentford Electric Ltd. The mangent energizing current waveform is I(t) = Idc - Iaccos2πft where f is the 15 Hz series resonant frequency of the high Q circuit. The dc and ac components are generated with one power source, not two as in eariler designs for rapid-cycling synchrotrons (e.g., NINA, DESY, CEA, PPA, and Cornell) Magnet power system parameters are summerized as follows: Operation Energy BMag IMag ESource Injection 200 MeV 488 G 74 A 64 V Extraction 8GeV 6.7KG 1023 A 890 V"
"In order to find transductors suitable for the requirements of the ZGS, four commercial transductors were compared with a precision coaxial shunt. The results of these measurements, which determine the stability, linearity, hysteresis, frequency response, output ripple, coefficients of temperature and line voltage, and effects of magnetic stray fields, are reported."
"A 40 kW active filter is used with each of the main accelerator's 12 quadrupole power supplies to reduce the power supply's voltage ripple. The active filter operates on a voltage-bucking principle with the filter output transformer coupled into the quadrupole magnet bus. The filter electronics is designed to respond to the first three harmonic components of ripple in the power supply output. Voltage ripple attenuation during injection, acceleration, and extraction is approximately 30 dB. Quadrupole magnet current ripple is correspondingly reduced."
"The Oak Ridge Isochronous Cyclotron RF system has been converted from an RCA 6949 power amplifier to an RCA 4648 power amplifier. The primary incentive was to reduce tube replacement cost; however, improved system performance and reliability were also realized. Existing servo-tuned driver amplifier stages and RF voltage regulator loops were retained. Typical accelerating potential noise levels are about 0.05% to 0.1% peak to peak noise per peak RF voltage."
"An additional high power RF system has been built for Nimrod to provide an 8th harmonic accelerating field i.e. the 2nd harmonic of the main RF. Its purpose is to reduce the bunching factor of the proton beam thus increasing beam acceptance and accelerated intensity. In the accelerating cavity a drift tube is tuned over a frequency range from 2.8 MHz to 16 MHz by two ferrite loaded resonators. The configuration adopted proved to have considerable advantages over a self contained tuned cavity particularly for assembly and access, permitting economy in the use of ferrite. The problems discussed include that of covering a wide tuning range while restricting the magnetic flux in the ferrite, suppressing unwanted modes in the cavity and maintaining accurately the phase and amplitude of the harmonic field relative to the main RF."
 "The slow extraction from the main ring at NAL utilizes the half-integer resonance at υx = 41/2. Extraction elements are three quadrupoles and one octupole. Two quadrupoles control the tune during the extraction while the third one is used to compensate for the tune fluctuation, thereby reducing the amount of the beam intensity modulation. The turn separation is produced by the average octupole field in the ring as well as by the special octupole which is located in phase with extraction quadrupoles. The size of turn separation is also controlled by a local bump in the closed orbit near the extraction septum. The beam has been extracted with the spill time up to 700 ms and with the efficiency of 85-90%. Together with a pinger, it is also possible to extract over 90% of the beam in less than 400 μs."
"The proton beam extracted from the National Accelerator Laboratory main ring synchrotron is transported through a magnetic switchyard that is designed to carry the external beam to three experimental area targeting stations located 3500 to 5000 ft. from the synchrotron extraction point. Two beam splitting facilities have been recently installed in the switchyard transport system so that all three experimental areas can receive beam simultaneously."
 "A fast shaving ejection during 10 or 11 turns is the most promising system for the transfer of the CPS beam to the 300 GeV machine under construction for which the CPS is to be the injector. The scheme uses a pair of fast kickers which shift the beam in 10 or 11 steps across an electrostatic septum, located at a position where the amplitude function is increased to near 100m and the momentum compaction function reduced to near zero. A prototype system has been installed in the CPS and tests have been carried out at 10 GeV/c with bunched and adiabatically debunched beams. The stability of the operation, ejection efficiency, emittance and momentum spread of the ejected beam are of major interest and have been measured. The test results are in agreement with theory and no serious difficulties have been observed."
"A study has been made of the focusing and guiding properties of a long electrostatic quadrupole structure that has been uniformly twisted about its axis. It is demonstrated that compared to the classical chain of quadrupole triplets, the twisted structure is inherently more strongly focusing and can accept more widely divergent particle beams."
"Attenuation by coherent pair production in highly oriented compression annealed pyrolytic graphite has been used to polarize a 16 GeV bremsstrahlung beam. Graphite pieces of total volume 0.95 × 0.95 × 5.1 cm3 were assembled in water-cooled precision holders. Eighteen of these units were mounted in two independent coaxial assemblies. Each assembly provided precision angular orientation with respect to the beam direction, rotation of the graphite by 90° about the beam axis to rotate the plane of polarization, and removal from or insertion into the beam. One assembly, with 61 cm of graphite, served as a polarizer; the other, with 30.5 cm of graphite, was used as an analyzer. The complete device was placed between collimators in a sweeping magnet. Polarization of the attenuated beam, measured with the SLAC pair spectrometer, was 0.255 ± 0.020. This number, and the measured spectrum, are in qualitative accord with the calculations. The beam has yielded intensities greater than 4 × 108 equivalent quanta per pulse, and has been used in an experiment to measure asymmetries in pseudoscalar meson photoproduction."
"Accelerator beam transport system instrumentation, and operation in general, is a matter of routine engineering. Given sufficient funds and space, an optimum design with maximum effective human interface usually prevails. However, given a very low budget and the criteria that the alternately injected e-, e+ beam be run simultaneously with a minimum of six other primary beams, a deviation from standard design practice and operation philosophy was required. This paper will describe the requirements necessary to bring the alternate e- or e+ beam through the 400 meter long beam transport system with an initial common bend of 48° then a separate bend of 12° each for each of the electron and positron beam paths. The approach to effectively fulfill the operation requirements was a coherent mixture of adding controls to existing similar function panels and a multitask operation chassis. This multitask chassis contains different but interrelated functions in a single panel. The operation of this multitask panel is also operable from the distant and separate SPEAR control room. The deviation of general engineering practices resulted in an optimum performance per cost balance."
"A high intensity stopped K-meson beam with a design goal of 105 stopped K+ per pulse is being constructed for the Bevatron. The facility is a large acceptance, 33-ft long beam line, which selects and transports 500 MeV/c K's to a stopper. The beam consists of a symmetrical arrangement of two large 900 bending magnets, three quadrupoles, and two electrostatic separators. Construction completion of this facility is scheduled for the Fall of 1973."
"A new Monte Carlo program, CASIM, has been written specifically to solve high energy hadron shielding problems. The program starts from inclusive distributions of nucleons and pions from nuclear interactions and generates averages (over many incident particles) of particle fluxes and energy deposition throughout the shield. Within this limitation the program has several advantages over other shielding calculations: a) quite complicated source terms (e.g., Hagedorn's thermodynamical model) can easily be used, b) weighting techniques permit following cascades over large distances as well as examining of selected geometries, heterogeneous media, etc., c) short coding and d) short execution times. Results of CASIM are presented for protons incident on realistic geometries as well as an intercomparison of predictions for a solid beamstop using two different production models."
 "The destructive capability of the beam power of some accelerators was dramatically demonstrated in a series of tests at SLAC using an 18 GeV e- beam at average powers ranging from 165 to 880 kW. The purpose of the experiments was to examine a series of devices which simulated beam stoppers, protection collimators and burnthrough monitors as presently applied at SLAC. Specific attention was given to the recording of burnthrough times, temperature behavior, and to the analysis of failure modes. A summary of the test data is presented. The design of an extensive electronic system to prevent damage to mechanical devices and to detect onset of destruction is discussed. Various sensors are connected to integrating and peak reading circuits to form power, beam verification and errant beam monitors. Burnthrough monitors shut down the accelerator if damage occurs to critical items. New features such as self-checking, protected wiring and rapid on-line calibration are described."
"The previously described intense source of 14- MeV neutrons has been observed to produce a source strength of 3 × 1012 s-1, and a flux density of 7 × 1011 cm-2 s-1 on a small sample. Development work is in progress to increase the intensity further."
"A supersonic jet target of H2(D2) having an areal density of 5×1017 protons/cm2 and 360° access in vacuum has been fabricated for use on the LAMPF NPL beam."
"The transverse and longitudinal effect in short high current RF buckets of cylindrical geometry and uniform charge distribution are considered in free space. Two cases are examined (a) The beam is radially constructed (magnetically) and (b) The beam is free both radially and longitudinally. Transverse expansion of a beam in space with a non-symmetrical conducting boundary is presented."
"The University of Maryland cyclotron now produces the following beams on a regular basis: E(1H+)≤lOO MeV, E(2H+)≤82 MeV, E(3He+2)≤200 MeV, E(4He+2≤165 MeV. Uses of these beams and properties of the beam transport system for the various experimental areas are surveyed, and results of beam studies presented. Problems now under consideration are briefly discussed."
"It is demonstrated that high quality secondary electron beams can be made available with intensities of 108 e/pulse at the new generation proton accelerators. A beam design is presented with the following qualities. 1) Large beam transport acceptance [9.5 μster % Δp/p (FW), with a momentul bite of ± 2%], 2) good momentum resolution [less than ± 0.3%], 3) good angular resolution [less than ± 0.1 mrad], 4) small final spot size [less than ± 3 mm horizontally and ± 6 mm vertically]; and 5) negligible pion contamination [less than 1 pion in 105 electrons]. All of these qualities are achieved while preserving the valuable electron intensities at production. Using standard beam transport magnets a 300 GeV/c transport system is designed with four focussing stages, the first two of which provide a beam spot of sufficient quality for tagged photon experiments. The optics design is based on a periodic cell structure which includes correction of second order aberrations by means of four weak sextupoles. The synchrotron radiation by electron throughout the transport system is used to advantage, to remove pion contamination at the final beam spot. Pion impurity is null at energies greater than 160 GeV. This high quality transport system can also be used to de} iver a high intensity pion beam [109 - 1010 π- per 1013 interacting protons], up to 300 GeV/c. Thus a very versatile facility can be provided for electron and pion experiments at the same installation."
 "The Astron concept for Thermonuclear research requires a layer of circulating electrons of sufficient density to confine and heat a plasma. This layer, called the E-layer, is formed by an accelerator injecting 6 Mev electrons at a 4° angle from perpendicular. The accelerator produces a 600 amp pulsed beam of 300 ns duration. A delay line has been built for the purpose of increasing the peak injection current. The 300 ns pulsed beam is split in half by a kicker and the first half is delayed so it can be injected on the opposite side of the trapping solenoid simultaneously with the second half of the beam. Thus two short pulses of 150 ns each are injected into Astron with one pulse traveling through a transport system of five bends and straight sections. (Figure I)."
"The aberrations present in a beam line represent the departure from the ideal first-order design. Such aberrations may be of second and higher order. Individual second-order terms may be represented by a matrix T. We derive a formalism for representing the net contribution of such terms to the beam dimensions. Corrective elements such as sextupoles or non-linearities in bending magnets may be employed. A method for minimizing the effects of second-order aberrations has been derived. This method has been incorporated into the program TRANSPORT. Higher-order effects may now arise from the coupling of second-order terms. A computer program TURTLE is used to evaluate such effects."
 "We have instrumented a battery-powered golf cart for making routine radioactivity surveys of the NAL Main Accelerator. The purpose of the surveys is to provide complete and reproducible plots of induced radioactivity for radiation safety, extrapolation to higher intensity operation, and accelerator diagnostics. We discuss the design of the vehicle and present some results of surveys."
"The NAL Main Ring extraction system has delivered both slow and fast extracted beam at 100, 200 and 300 GeV. Construction progress, operating conditions, instrumentation and beam characteristics are discussed."
"Equipment associated with the accelerator and experimental areas at the National Accelerator Laboratory is distributed throughout some ten miles of beam paths. The computer control system, which utilizes fifteen interconnected computers to control and monitor this equipment, is described. The clock, closed-circuit television, beam abort, and fire and utility monitoring systems are also reviewed."
"The SLAC Main Control Center (MCC) incorporates functions that were previously handled in two separate control rooms; i.e., (1) the setup and maintenance of interlaced beams in the accelerator and (2) the delivery of the beams to separate experimental areas. The complexity of beam operation has increased with the activation of the new SPEAR facility. This experimental area uses low energy electrons and positrons which run simultaneously with a full complement of six other beams. Considering all the operational requirements, the MCC instrumentation plays a major role in determining the operation efficiency."
 "The SFC system provides detailed information about the injector beam and the capture and early acceleration cycle of the ZGS more rapidly and accurately than was previously possible. The system was an important part of the retuning program after the titanium vacuum chamber installation. The SFC's a-re frequently employed in maintaining stable ZGS operation with intense beams."
"A set of beam transformers measures the intensity of each bunch, circulating or ejected. Five electrostatic pick-ups measure the radial position of one selected bunch. Secondary emission grids and luminescent screens give the profile and position of the beam at relevant points. Gated radiation detectors monitor beam loss in the ejection area. All signals are digitalized and fed to a minicomputer on line. Readout is via nixies, CRT analogue displays, pen recorders and a teletype. Statistics can be made over a chosen number of acceleration cycles."
"Since the injection system of the AGS requires very tight control over many parameters, computer programs were written to achieve this. One program initiates an emittance measurement device and reduces its output data to provide the characteristics of the linac beam. The second program utilizes these results to set six quadrupoles and four bending magnets so that requested beam parameters are obtained at the inflector exit. A third program measures the circulating beam and attempts to maximize it by adjustment of quadrupoles and bending magnets. These programs and our experience in using them on-line are described."
"The Card Programmable Function Button Panel is basically a manual data entry device used for computer program assignment and binary control. However, it has the ability to be reassigned in over one thousand different configurations by changing a computer-read program card which also provides labeling of the panel's control buttons and indicator lights. The multiple assignment capability is accomplished by an optically-read ten-bit binary code on the program card. The panel is packaged in a 3-wide 8 3/4 inch high AEC Standard Nuclear Instrument Module (NIM). The front panel contains 30 control-button/indicator-light pairs which are labeled by the dollar-bill-sized program cards. The cards are made of a thin white plastic with a special writing surface. The recessed indicator-light matrix thus provides separate backlighting through each of the button-adjacent printed partitions of the over-laying program cards. Binary code bitlocations are printed across the bottom edge of the card, and the cards are encoded by punching out the appropriate code using a standard hand punch. The panel contains all the electronics necessary for lamp drivers, lamp test, lamp dimmers, as well as the logic for the registration, validation, reading, and transmission of the card's binary code to the computer. Separate electronics provides for button-switch debouncing, encoding, key-roll-over protection, and indicator-status memory. Electronic and mechanical construction details are reviewed as well as a brief description of the panel's use on the operator's control consoles at the Clinton P. Anderson Meson Physics Facility of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (herein referred to as LAMPF)."
"Considerations of bandwidth, noise, distance, response time, data and system integrity, maintenance, interfacing, software control, data organization, cost, and development time complicate the implementation of intercomputer links in real time control and data acquisition systems. This paper tells how to do it. The NAL link provides an example."
 "Optical transition radiation produced by 40-60 MeV electrons crossing thin metallic foils has been studied in order to provide a beam diagnostic device. The radiation yield is roughly one photon per 100 electrons and the intensity appears to be Z independent ; the influence of bremsstrahlung is then fairly weak. Measurements of angular and γ dependence, spectral density and polarisation have been carried out and results are in good agreement with theories. When multiple scattering angles are negligible (< γ-1), a strong eneray dependence, close to γ3 , of the light intensity radiated into small solid angles is found. Moreover, the radiation is peaked in a direction making an angle γ-1 with the beam axis. Suitable optical arrangement make it possible beam position and profile determination. Measurement of the polarisation plane rotation by means of a scanning mirror provides a method of determining the incident angle of the beam onto the target. This device looks promising for diagnostics on particle beams-electrons as well as protons-with normalized energies γ in the range 1-103."
"In accelerators working at accelerating frequencies of several 100 MHz the bunch length is in the order of several hundred picoseconds. For obtaining good measurements the time resolution of the measuring apparatus should be 10 ps. With convenient electronic components such a high time resolution cannot be obtained. In this paper a method is described for measuring the bunch length optically by measuring the time structure of the light emitted by relativistic particles (synchrotron or Cerenkov radiation). The heart of the system is a wideband Nd3+-Glass Laser emitting infrared light at 1.06 μm. With a special technique, the so-called mode-locking, the laser is forced to emit high-intensity optical pulses of several GW peak power and a pulse-length of about 5 ps. These pulses enter a cell filled with a Kerr medium, e.g. CS2, and induce birefringence. Since the relaxation time of CS2 is small, the bire-fringent zone travels with c/n through the Kerr medium. Combinated with two polarizers the system works like a camera with a slit-shutter traveling at the velocity of light. By photographing a total time resolution of 10 ps is obtained."
  "The Bevatron has associated with its acceleration cycle many parameters which vary in a dynamic manner throughout that cycle. Control and monitoring of such parameters is now done largely by computer, so that many variables formerly in the analog realm and easily observed on the conventional oscilloscope are now in the digital realm and not easily observed. The Chromonitor is a device which has been developed to accept inputs from computers or the analog realm and display on a TV screen any or all of sixteen different parameters which may be associated with particle acceleration and delivery, or which may be pertinent to monitoring a computer process in progress. Each of the parameters may be displayed in any of seven colors."
"An axiom for digital control enthusiasts. \"The digital processor will make every attempt to destroy the hardware and humans subject to its control. Nibblers; yes, even gobblers; planted within the software will eventually consume themselves and cause the most unexpected results. Hardware must be organized in such a Maaner, that the software cannot damage it. As an extension of this concept, consider the mean time between failure\". If you extend your MTBF by judicious application of \" quality assurance\", catasrophe will utlimately overtake you. Thus, consider not the MTBF, but rather, consider the catastrophic nature of the failure. Learn to have \"well-behaved\" shutdown instead of failure."
"This paper describes an automatic Q measurement system (Q = fbetatron/frevolution) which was developed and installed at the 28 GeV Proton Synchrotron of CERN. At the desired moment the beam is excited to 1mm betatron oscillations by means of a programmed full aperture air kicker. The frequency spectrum which appears at a beam position pick-up station contains the non integer part of the Q value as the lowest frequency. A voltage controlled RC filter scans the pick-up signal spectrum. When the lowest frequency of the spectrum is attained, a feedback loop switches the filter to a constant frequency. The ratio measurement (normalization to the revolution frequency) is performed by counting the doubled acceleration frequency during 10 periods of the filter output frequency. The counter output is fed to a computer which displays after data handling the Q value on an alphanumeric cathode ray tube. The measurement time for the acquisition of the horizontal or vertical Q value is less than lms. The resolution of the measurement is ΔQ = 0.001."
"A technique for generating driving waveforms having non-linear dependence on an independent variable is described. Forward biased high-conductance silicon diodes are used as feedback elements in an operational amplifier circuit. A FORTRAN time-sharing computer program has been written and used to aid in the selection of circuit components. A radio frequency program generator has been designed and built to provide the drive to a voltage-controlled oscillator as a function of the NAL main accelerator bend magnet current."
"Each NAL booster and main accelerator rf station contains a phase lock control loop to resonate the beam-line cavities at the applied excitation (reference) frequency. The phase sensor in the loop is a dual channel phase detector having an octave bandwidth, an amplitude dynamic range of 60 dB, a phase balance vs. frequency better than ±2° and a zero crossover phase sensitivity of 0.18 V/deg. The phase detector develops a feedback \"error\" signal proportional to the phase difference between the rf reference signal and an rf signal representing the rf station beam line voltage. This paper discusses the rf cavity tuning feedback loop configuration and describes the details of the phase detector circuitry."
"A secondary emission monitor has been designed and tested for use in beam profile measurements of the extracted proton beam of the Nevis Synchrocyclotron. The monitor will provide a non-destructive simultaneous measurement of the vertical and horizontal position distributions, with a resolution of ~ .1 in. A residual gas ionization counter has been also designed. This counter will measure the radial profile of the accelerated beam at the parking radius."
"The Central Control Room for the MIT Linac is designed for simplicity of operation (one man) with an eye on future use of a computer to set the desired operating parameters. A natural summing of local controls around the five RF driver/dual-modulators and the injector/master oscillator control room allows one to switch to the display and control of the six areas one at a time with a trunk line. The distributed parameters (magnetics, radiation and RF phase monitoring) are mostly monitored and controlled directly from CCR with pushbutton selection of each parameter. Also mentioned are the detailed results of RF processing the 7m, S-band accelerator sections with 15ps, 4MW pulses at repetition rates exceeding 1000 s-1 and phase tuning the rectangular waveguide networks using a combination of the SLAC method and beam loading maximization."
 "The low energy orbit warps in the ZGS are corrected by eight current-regulated single-turn kicker windings. The currents regulated in these coils can be set individually by the operators through a central digital control system. Since large first harmonic warps are produced by small current changes in single coils, blind, individual adjustment of the eight currents is seldom productive. This paper describes a computer program and interactive graphic display system which allow accelerator operators to visualize the effects of single or multiple kicker coil current changes. The display provides numeric as well as graphic representation of the orbit warp produced. Localized orbit bumps can be inserted by specifying location and size. The program can be used for offline visualization purposes only, or optionally the desired currents can be introduced immediately by the computer."
"In the past, steering of the 50-MeV proton beam into the main ring of the ZGS was performed empirically. The method was unsatisfactory because of the heterogeneity of the magnet adjustments. An algorithm was developed that described the orthogonal position of the beam in terms of exit position, exit angle, and position in the center achromat. Any combination of steering parameters can be made by adjustment of the achromatic magnets. The necessary modes of operation, functions, and readouts are combined in a consolette. The consolette is interfaced with the central control computer as an on-line, time-shared input/output (I/O) device. When a steering change is desired, the computer, via stepping motors, adjusts the four magnets for the required solution."
"We give the theory and describe the execution of the magnetic beam position monitors in use in the AGS injection line. These are strictly linear devices of very low impedance with a rise time of the order of 1 μsec. They do not require electronics close to the device and have been constructed to withstand considerable radiation. Their construction is simple and not critical."
"A system for automatically controlling the instantaneous phase of the accelerating voltage at each of the six accelerating stations at the Cornell 12 GeV Electron Synchrotron has been developed. The phases are controlled to ±50° relative to a master oscillator. The system comprises electronic phase shifters to compensate for variations in klystron phase shifts during the acceleration cycle, and mechanical phase shifters to compensate for drive cable delay variations. Near full energy, when different klystron modulator waveforms are used in each station, the phase control provides an effective increase of 20% in RF power by cancelling the 180° phase shift which occurs in each klystron as it is brought up to full power. The phase control system is also a great aid in obtaining correct phasing when more than one station is used to pick up the beam."
"The National Accelerator Laboratory (NAL) Main Ring Beam Loss Monitor System employs 200 inexpensive liquid scintillation detectors distributed evenly around the accelerator circumference to measure radiation created when protons strike vacuum chamber walls, obstructions, magnets, etc. The detectors are interfaced to the computer control system through 10 channel \"sample and hold\" electronics which also integrate and amplify incoming pulses. Since the computer system can arbitrarily select the times during a machine cycle when sampling will occur, it is possible to generate real time graphs of radiation loss versus time, radiation loss versus machine circumference, or a three dimensional histogram combining the two."
"A number of high energy physics experiments are based on a random distribution of particles entering the experimental appa. ratus. Unfortunately, the extra. cted beam from a proton synchrotron will display a bunching due to the RF cavity. However, this bunching can be reduced or destroyed by various techniques; such as, by introducing noise into the RF cavity during extraction, or by lengthening the energy loss target. Therefore, in order to measure the effectiveness of these various techniques, a monitoring system is needed to detect the amount of RF structure present in the extracted beam. The design of the RF structure monitor used at the Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS) will now be described. Further, the results obtained from using this system will be discussed."
"Small, air-filled, ion chambers have been constructed to serve as localized beam spill monitors. They are mounted at the downstream end of each straight section of the ring and are useful for locating beam obstructions and for finding spills due to abnormal machine adjustment. The chamber is made up of thin aluminum sheets with mylar insulation and is enclosed in a lucite box. No preamplifier is used, but the signals are transported to the Main Control Room (MCR) via RG-22/U shielded pair to maintain good SNR. A central 300 V power supply provides ion collection potential for all eight chambers. The signals are processed for individual and multiplexed monitoring."
"We have, at the Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS), a beam viewer which displays in near real time the brightness, width, and position of the beam. This consists basically of a calibrated phosphorescent screen which nondestructively collects ions generated by the circulating beam. A closed circuit TV system transports the signal to the Main Control Room. Circuits were developed which derive analog voltages representative of the beam width and position from the synchronization and video signals. The brightness vs. horizontal position linearity was improved by vidicon model change and a simple shading circuit. A calibrator which simulates a beam was built into the system and is invaluable for initial setup and linearity tests."
"Solid state high frequency limiter amplifiers and fast rise time voltage comparators for pulse shaping make zero crossing time a meaningful phase reference. A circuit based on these principles was developed and is in use in the beam phase feedback loop of the ZGS. It has excellent linearity for voltage out vs delay for up to 50° with a phase error of < 8° for the following input condition: input voltage amplitude from 0.1 - 2.0 V and beam bunch rate from 4.4 - 14.0 MHz. A detector is included to insure a zero output reference when there is no beam or when beam levels are below the phase-lock threshold."
"The difference signals from radial pi induction electrodes located in the eight straight section boxes of the ZGS are used to determine equilibrium orbit warps. A 1 μs, debunched linac beam is injected in the ZGS ring and the eight coasting beam signals are analyzed. Since the effective electrode centers and inflector magnet positions are known, one can obtain orbit positions around the ZGS ring. The zero crossing times of all eight coasting beam bow-tie patterns are entered into our CDC-924A computer. The computer graphically displays orbit warps via CRT terminal. An additional feature to be described is that betatron tunes at injection can be very easily obtained from the coasting beam patterns."
"A controls' philosophy used during research, development, and operation of ion sources for the ZGS has been instituted. The total control design concept aids in the learning curve during research, development, and the turnover to the operational group. The system is designed for manual control, central computer control, and programmer computer control. The operational multiplicity is achieved by time sharing and priority interrupt assignments. Individual control console design varies with source complexity, but basic functions are similar."
"A digital distribution system has been constructed at the Indiana University cyclotron facility to link the control computer, an XDS Sigma 2, with the three stages of the accelerator and the control console. This system consists of a network of modular digital multiplexers attached to a common bidirectional data bus. When fully expanded, the system can transmit or receive 16-bit data words to or from 1024 different devices. In addition, a device may generate a computer interrupt by raising 1 of 256 available status bits. The multiplex system was implemented with XDS T series modules and thus is compatible with any DTL or TTL logic."
"The controls of the Oak Ridge Isochronous Cyclotron are being interfaced to a computer system. The initial implementation of the system is designed to reduce the time for setting up the cyclotron between experiments and to closely monitor the operation of the accelerator's power supplies. The system will be expanded to include the monitoring and control of the RF, beam-line, and vacuum systems. Later, diagnostic devices will be interfaced so that beam quality and intensity may be optimized. The operator communicates with the cyclotron via a CRT interactive display and a control console containing reassignable function keys and LED readout devices. The computer is a Modular Computer Systems MCS III/5. Operation data and programs for controlling the cyclotron are stored on disc and magnetic tape libraries."
"The high-current beam research at Livermore requires the capability of bunching the 700-A, 6-MeV electron beam of the Astron electron accelerator. The mass of the particles in the beam are modulated by an RF cavity and then transported around a 30-ft-diam.ring to produce bunching. The ring uses a set of eight bending magnets, a set of eight focusing magnets, and eight defocusing magnets. Each set of magnets is series connected and excited from a single power supply. To provide the necessary field trimming, a three-decade set of digitally actuated resistors is connected across each magnet."
"A brief description of the stripline position and intensity monitor for the SPEAR transport system is presented. The basic objective of this system is to visually display on an oscilloscope the current and position information of a 7 ns positron/electron beam of very low duty cycle (10-20 pps). The system incorporates and uses much of the video system at the Main Control Center (MCC) which was designed to display video pulses of 1.6 μs width. In order to maintain compatibility with this system, the detected signals from the stripline monitors, which are 7 ns bipolar signals, are transformed into stretched signals of the order of 1 μs, the amplitude and polarity of which reflect those of the original signals. System functions and the associated electronics are described in detail."
 "The control system for the Clinton P. Anderson Meson Physics Facility (LANPF) is organized around an on-line digital computer. Accelerator operations are conducted from the Central Control Room (CCR) where two identical but independent operator consoles provide the man-machine interface. This paper traces the evolution of the man-machine interface from the initial concepts of a computer control system. Special emphasis is given to the human factors which influenced the development. The way in which an operator interacts with the system is illustrated by a description of an accelerator operating sequence."
  "A unified control system philosophy allows operation of the linac from a PDP-8 mini-computer with full supervisory control, data acquisition and the full computation capability of the PDP-10 located at the AGS. Interface hardware for diagnostic monitoring equipment and operational control equipment is described. Failure of any link in the control system does not necessitate shut down of the linac, only a diminished control capability results."
"A method for mapping electron accelerator beams employing a thin film dosimeter(TFD) is discussed. The preparation, handling, exposure and reading of the TFD is elaborated. Examples are given of areal maps and depth dose measurements. An instrument for reading the film is discussed."
     "The principle of this monitor - used in beam emittance measurements on transport lines - is based on secondary emission phenomenon in dielectric layers. Thin aluminium strips covered with low density KCI layer are used. Measurements with electron beams in the range 150 to 400 MeV are made with foils and strips in the region of stable operation. Observations upon avalanche multiplications encountered are also reported."
"A charged-particle beam current monitor has been designed using a coaxial cable transmission line in a configuration similar to that employed in building toroidal-wound wide band impedance matching and balun transformers. Several sizes of the coax-wound monitors have been constructed and compared with units of similar ferrite core material and geometry that were wound with ordinary magnet wire. One of the transformers has been used by experimenters at the NAL Internal Tarqet area since August of 1972. In order to simplify electronic signal processing, only average circulating charge is measured. This is done by measuring the \"zero\"signal\" base-line shift due to the natural L/R response of the transformer."
"Superconducting pulsed magnets for use in high field synchrotrons and storage rings and dc dipoles and quadrupoles for use in beam transport lines are reviewed. Operating and construction plans for the immediate future are presented."
"A D. C. superconducting C-frame magnet for use with polarized proton targets has been assembled and tested at ANL. This magnet has a vertical field of 25 k Gauss, uniform to within 4 parts in 104 over a 10 cm diameter, 2 cm high cylinder located at the center of the magnet's 10 cm high room temperature air gap. The magnet consists of two sets of coils each containing a main coil and a correction coil. Each set of coils is mounted on its own coil form and in its own liquid helium dewar with only a small bellow communication line between them. The field is shimmed by adjustment of the correction coil current and by mechanical adjustment of the position of the top set of coils relative to the bottom set."
"An 8° bending magnet system for 30 GeV primary protons from the Brookhaven AGS is to be installed in the summer of 1973. This bend requires operating two magnet modules, each 6-ft. long, at an excitation up to 37kG. The cold bore I.D. is 3.375-in. A 20-in. long full-scale cross section model has been extensively tested. Multipole field components due to the magnet circuit, produce field error ~1 × 10-4 parts below 20kG out to the measurement radius at 82% of the radius to the superconductor. The \"good field\" (~1×10-4 parts) shrinks to a radius ~50% of the radius to the superconductor by 40kG. Diamagnetic effects in the superconductor are completely negligible by 5kG, with the exception of the (r4,5θ) multipole. This contributes 6.5 x 10-4 parts to the field at 82% of radius. End effects are sufficiently small that for 6-ft. long magnets little or no modifications of end contours are required for even very exacting applications. The magnet has operated to 45kG with no evidence of significant training. The magnet has been thermally cycled several times, and the field aberrations allowed by magnet design symmetries reproduce exactly from the first to last measurement runs. At 19. lkG, all allowed multipoles, i. e., 5θ,7θ,9θ,11θ, with 3θ tuned to zero agree to 1×10-4 parts error over the duration of experimental measurements. However, ferromagnetic effects due to martensitic transformations in the stainless steel inner form on which the coils are wound have grown with repeated thermal and magnetic cycling."
 "The development program for the superconducting magnets of the Intersecting Storage Accelerators is described. The dipole magnet design is of the cos θ type and employs wide ribbon conductor. Magnetic measurements are compared with calculations which include the effects of conductor magnetization and iron saturation. Calculations of the harmonics due to the magnet ends will also be presented along with estimates of the effect of the shape of the outer boundary of the iron shield on the field and the degree of interaction between the magnets in the two rings. The conductor is a metal-filled braid woven from 186 wires each containing 400 filaments. A precision molding technique has been developed which assures accurate placement of the turns and could be used for semi-mass production. The iron cores are laminated and assembled in a special way to eliminate the axial differential expansion between the coil and the core. Correction coils for the 3θ and 5θ terms are built into the bore tubes. These coils are necessary to correct the small (10-3) harmonics produced by conductor magnetization at low field and iron saturation at high fields."
"The mechanical and thermal properties of polymer materials have been studied in a temperature range from 4.2°K to 300°K. Some of these polymers have been irradiated up to 2 × 108 rad in liquid nitrogen and liquid neon and the same properties were subsequently tested. A brief description of the various testing techniques is given."
"To facilitate the production of hyperon-enriched beams for bubble chamber experiments, a range of pulsed magnets has been developed, featuring 20-40 cm-long bending magnets with peak fields up to 13T, and 30-60 cm-long quadrupoles having gradients as high as 50OT/m; ape rtu res a re typically 2-6 cms. Such parameters lend themselves to beam lines capable of kinematic analysis and focusing in very short distances, with consequent minimised decay losses. All magnets are air-cored and water-cooled, with goemetries tailored to suit particular experimental requirements. Of singular importance are the measures taken to distribute in-pulse loads and minimise fatigue so that lifetimes may be stretched to at least 200,000 shots. Special attention is paid to the cooling of otherwise-limiting components of clamping assemblies, permitting the pulsed beamline to operate at machine rates of 25 ppm, and even to double-pulse if necessary."
"The 28 GeV Proton Synchrotron of CERN (CPS) is now 15 years old. Initially planned as an accelerator for 25 GeV physics, the CPS is developing into the key element of an accelerator complex comprising recently built machines such as the 28 GeV Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR), the 800 MeV PS Booster (PSB), and the 300 GeV SPS now under construction."
"An extracted beam current of ~ 25 μA of ~ 575 MeV protons from the modified Nevis Synchrocyclotron will strike two meson producing targets before coming to rest in a beam stop. The quadrupole and dipole transport magnets viewing the targets at close range might absorb 1010-1011 rad/yr. or more. Conventional coil insulating techniques employing epoxy, fiberglass, alumina filled matrices can withstand, at best, a total absorbed dose of a few times 1010 rads. Therefore, a coil fabrication and insulating method depending entirely upon inorganic materials was developed. The coils are fabricated from hollow aluminum conductor which is wound, hard anodized, and assembled. Hard anodized aluminum sheets serve as additional layer to layer and ground insulation and inorganically bound mica mat is used between turns."
"Sextupole magnets of 4 inch aperture, 2 kG/in2 strength have been designed for use in the NAL Meson Area beam line. Pole shapes have been determined by conformal mapping to give continuous contours which are approximated by short straight line segments to facilitate machining. The resulting field quality is within .17 percent of a pure sextupole over a 3 inch \"Good Field Width\". The excitation is provided by a monolithic coil on each pole wound from .230 inch solid square copper. Four water-cooled flattened tubes provide heat sinks for conduction cooling with a maximum temperature rise of 20° C in the winding. Magnetic field measurements are presented."
"An approximate method of dealing the grain orientation effect has been investigated. This has been applied to the field computation of the main ring quadrupole magnet of KEK-PS."
"Septum magnets have been built for the front ends of secondary beam lines M1 and M6 in the Meson Area. The septum sizes are 1.742 in (1.248 in) for the M1 (M6) magnet. Field quality is reasonably good, as measured, although not as good as the design goals of 0.3% (0.1%) for M1 (M6)."
"Most studies on high-field bending magnets for superconducting synchrotrons or high energy beam transport in the last years concentrated on designs with a circular aperture and cos θ current distribution which is approximated by blocks of windings of stepwise decreasing current density. An alternative solution consists in the design of a magnet with square or rhomb shaped aperture which has the property that rectangular coils with only 2 steps of current density represent its exact solution. There exist also solutions with the same current density in all coils. The multipole field distortions of this class of magnets are studied in order to find suitable shapes of the outer iron shield."
"Complex variable function theory is used to formulate the magnetostatic problem of a rectangular current block of uniform current density located within a circular region bounded by infinite permeability iron. The magnetic field from the superposition of several blocks arranged to exhibit dipole symmetry is calculated using a generalization of Cauchy's integral formula. Subsequent multipole expansion yields expressions for the multipole coefficients which through the use of variable metric minimization permits block arrangements to be found for rather pure dipole fields. Application is made to superconducting dipoles for both a pancake arrangement and a shell arrangement of the individual blocks."
 "Two main coil failures in a one-year period initiated a review of on-line protective circuitry. Two existing circuits, which would limit damage, were made more reliable. Four new circuits were added to monitor coil condition and protect against voltage transients."
"To establish a meaningful history of the electrical condition of our main magnet coils, various instruments and techniques were developed for a diagnostic program."
"A pulsed beam shutter magnet is required to deflect a beam of separated high energy particles into a beam stop after a desired number of particles have reached the 12-ft bubble chamber at the ZGS. The magnet has a core, wound from 2 mil grain-oriented steel, an aperture 15 cm × 15 cm, and a ∫Bdl=1kGm. The pulse has a risetime of ≤3 #x003BC;s and a flattop of 40 μs. The above is achieved by discharging a high voltage capacitor bank into the magnet inductance, followed by a power-crowbar. The design of the magnet and the switching circuits is described and formulas for calculating the pulse shapes are given. Graphs of calculated flattops to 500 μs are shown."
"During the last few years more and more Spectrometer Magnets were employed in high energy physics experiments. Most of these experiments detected a relatively small number of particle secondaries because the apertures of the magnets were not satisfactorily large. For this reason an attempt is being made at BNL to build a spectrometer which could accommodate experiments on more complicated types of interactions with detection of many secondaries. Obviously this spectrometer, in order to perform properly, will be large and with an acceptable magnetic field; it must have better resolution, and a wide solid angle acceptance. The basic idea is a large aperture C-magnet. High resolution digitized spark chambers, low mass proportional chambers and scintillation counter hodoscopes will be located and operated within the magnetic field volume which will be 4-ft high by 6-ft wide by 15-ft long. The main spectrometer is to be followed by a set of large digitized spark chambers, scintillation counter hodoscopes, and Cerenkov counter hodoscopes to provide improved momentum resolution and particle identification for those particles which emerge through the downstream aperture of the magnets. This magnet spark chamber combination will give the experimenter freedom to move to a new class of experiments."
 "The CERN Intersecting Storage Rings are now in routine operation for colliding-beam physics. In 1972 more than 75% of the total operating time was used for physics or preparation for physics runs. The machine's performance has increased substantially. The original design aim for luminosity has been reached and decay rates and background radiation with intense beams have been further reduced. Some operational aspects and the main performance limitations are described."
"Initial operating experience with the SLAC electron-positron storage ring SPEAR is described. A luminosity of 1.2 × 1031 cm-2 sec-1 has been achieved and two-beam interaction effects are described. A single-beam coherent instability, which can be suppressed either by control of the ring chromaticity or by feedback, has been observed. Current-dependent bunch lengthening and widening have been observed, and experiments indicate that these phenomena may be associated with an increase in the energy spread of the beam. Procedures to increase the luminosity to the design value are discussed. Plans to increase the maximum beam energy of SPEAR to 4.5 GeV are described."
 "The maximum beam intensity achieved in the ISR has been limited up to now by the beam induced pressure rise which builds up with the stacked proton current. This pressure increase can be explained by ion induced gas desorption from the vacuum chamber. The pressure P, as a function of the stacked proton current I, can be described in good approximation by P = Po/[1-(k η/S)I], where Po is the pressure without beam, S the pumping speed, η the net gas desorption coefficient in molecules per incident gas ion and k is a constant. This concept shows the existence of a critical current at which the pressure goes to infinity. The desorption coefficient depends on the primary ion energy, the type of ions and above all, on the surface conditions. Surface treatments yielding low and even negative values of #x003B7; are discussed together with experimental results obtained."
"Betatron and phase instabilities have been observed at the CEA during multicycle filling and dc storage. The betatron instabilities are caused by the head-tail effect and have been controlled with sextupoles which make the chromaticity zero or slightly positive. The phase instability at present limits the electron and positron current which can be accumulated. We have made measurements of the threshold currents required to observe the onset of phase instabilities. These measurements show: a. The threshold current required to observe the onset of this phase instability is independent of the number of bunches down even to one bunch. (Here and throughout this paper, current is defined as the current in one bunch averaged over one rf period, ie., 1 mA = 1.4 × 107/bunch.) b. The threshold current for the onset of this instability first decreases with increasing bunch length, goes through a minimum, then increases again for long bunch length. A cavity operating at the third harmonic of the main accelerating system frequency, thus providing increased nonlinearity of the total rf voltage waveform (hence increasing the Landau damping), increased the threshold current for the onset of these instabilities."
"After a shut down of several months during which some improvements were made on ACO such as a computer control of the power supplies, and a new detector for high energy experiments was installed, an extensive beam experiment program was started. This mainly concerned the beam-beam effect with and without small beam separation at the crossing point, the cure of transverse instabilities with new sextupolar coils placed inside the quadrupoles, the check of power supplies stabilizations by means of the synchrotron frequencies, and the development of a new ACO structure with low ß's. During the same period new measurements of the neutral modes of the ϕo were started on ACO. Finally a beam of synchrotron light extending up to 10 Å will soon be put in operation for molecular, atomic, and solid state physics. The typical luminosity at 510 MeV is now about 3.4.1032 cm-2.h-1 with 35 mA in each beam, and this new improvement seems to be related to a better power supplies stabilization."
"The original ISR design included the possibility of superposing equilibrium orbits in four of the eight intersection regions by means of supplementary quadrupoles. This scheme has two advantages. Firstly, the beam density is increased so improving the ratio of beam-beam to beam-gas counts and secondly, the size of the interaction diamond is greatly reduced. The closed orbit modulation was measured and the effects of this scheme on the betatron frequencies was studied. Since the scheme is applied with the stacks already circulating, dynamic computer control of the correcting elements is required to maintain the correct tuning in the ISR. In total, 31 power supplies are progressively changed. Since the machine is strongly perturbed by this scheme, nearly all aspects of operation are affected. This particularity applies to the excitation of localized bumps in the closed orbits. Fully satisfactory operation for physics experiments has been achieved with beams of typically 6 A, a luminosity of 1.4 × 1030 cm-2s-1 and a diamond size corresponding to a single injected pulse."
"During the ISABELLE preliminary design study it became clear from the response of the high energy physics community that the addition of an electron ring to the proposed 200-GeV colliding proton beam facility would be very attractive. It was felt that with the capability of this ring to reach an energy of 15 GeV the already wide range of experimental possibilities of ISABELLE would be greatly extended. Basic design features for such an electron ring have been worked out. Lattice parameters, rf system, injection scheme and characteristics of its interaction with one of the proton rings will be presented. The resulting luminosity was estimated to range from ≈ 1033 to ≈ 0.5 × 1032 cm-2 sec-1 for c.m. energies from 65 to 109 GeV."
"It is proposed to store protons as well as electrons and positrons in the DESY storage ring, DORIS. The techniques planned for accomplishing this and the hoped for results are described."
"Details of the current lattice design for PEP, the proton-electron-positron colliding beam system will be described. This system allows collisions of protons up to 150 GeV with electrons or positrons up to 15 GeV, by storing the proton beams in a superconducting storage ring and the electrons or positrons in a concentric conventional ring, and allows collisions between electrons and positrons in the same ring up to 15 GeV."
"We have developed a two-probe method of analyzing the momentum and radial-betatron-amplitude distributions in a circulating particle beam. It has been used successfully in an electron-ring research program to help diagnose beam instabilities and injection techniques."
"The general design features of experimental insertions for the ISA storage accelerators are presented. Various insertions which satisfy the requirements for specific high energy particle experiments are discussed. Some consideration is given to a) the distribution of the insertions in the lattice; b) the separation of experimental areas from those used for injection and protective extraction; c) the subject of beam crossing; d) the implications of high ß, high quadrupole gradient conditions required in the insertions; and e) general characteristics, including luminosity and beam momentum spread."
"The efficiency of the stacking process, in which protons are accumulated into longitudinal phase space by means of a radio frequency (RF) voltage, was measured as function of different parameters such as energy, RF voltage, number of stacking cycles and г = sin ϕs, ϕs is the relative phase of protons in synchronism with the RF voltage. The efficiency was found to depend predominantly on Γ and the number n of stacking cycles. Efficiencies higher than 70% were measured for values of Γ ⩽ 0.5 and n ⩾ 30 for both the repetitive and the nonrepetitive stacking scheme. The agreement between theoretical predicted efficiencies, obtained from a computer simulation of the stacking process, and the measured efficiencies is very good for higher values of n. From both the theoretical calculations and the measurements a rule of thumb could be derived which gives a good approximation of the stacking efficiency far above transition energy as function of Γ and n."
"The Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) are equipped with beam scrapers used for various purposes such as improving luminosity, reducing background, beam diagnostics and for protection of machine components. A description is given of the different types of scrapers and of the results in the various applications obtained during the last year. In particular, the substantial improvements in luminosity and background by scraping are described."
"The space charge induced Q-shifts were measured either by comparing the radial positions of a given nonlinear resonance with and without a stack, or by means of RF deflecting fields. The first consequence of these Q-shifts is a displacement of the working line in the stability diagram towards low order non-linear resonances. A secondary effect is a progressive reduction of the radial derivatives of the Q's at the edges of the stack with increasing intensity, which makes the stack unstable in these regions. These results were used to derive \"prestressed\" working lines which are suited to high intensity stacks."
"The proton beams in the CERN Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) have been accelerated to achieve colliding beams at 31.4 GeV/c, equivalent to a momentum of above 2000 GeV/c if a conventional accelerator with a stationary target were used. High density stacks were made at 26.5 GeV/c from which a part was rebunched with the maximum available RF voltage. The rebunched beam was kept near central orbit while the magnetic field was gradually increased to its maximum value. The major problem was to keep the betatron oscillation frequencies unchanged while changing the magnetic field thus avoiding any blow-up of the beam due to resonances. The corrections of the highly non-linear saturation effects of the main magnet were achieved by a computer controlled tuning of the field by excitation of the poleface windings and sextupole lenses. Closed orbit corrections were applied throughout the acceleration. Colliding beams with currents above 0.5 A were obtained."
"A feedback system designed to assist Landau damping against resistive wall instabilities in the vertical and horizontal planes is described. The purpose of the feedback system is to make it possible to run the ISR with reduced Q-spread, so that low order resonances can be avoided at high intensities. An important problem in the system is the electronic noise of the amplifiers which can cause excessive long-term vertical beam blow-up if the bandwidth is too large. Only four transverse modes are included in the loop."
"The layout of the ISR is discussed showing the situation of the six intersections presently used for physics experimentation. A brief discussion of some of the physics equipment installed is included. A description of an intersection region is given showing the space available and the constraints imposed by the vacuum chamber. The use of the machine for physics is discussed, the measurement of the luminosity at all the intersections, minimisation of background etc., the ISR control computer playing a large part in these operations. A section describing the so-called Split Field Magnet facility is included."
"The Cambridge Electron Accelerator (CEA) has been devoted solely to electron-positron colliding-beam physics since 1970. By early 1972 an operational system had been developed with a peak luminosity of 2 × 1028cm-2sec-1. An experiment observing e+e- , γγ, μ+ μ-, and hadron events was then completed at a beam energy of 2 + 2 GeV and an integrated luminosity of 1.12 x 1034cm-2. Since then, many improvements have been made to increase the average luminosity and to permit operation at higher energy. A cryogenic pumping system has been installed close to the interaction region resulting in a significant pressure drop and reduction in background in the luminosity counters. A final experiment is now in progress at a center-of-mass energy of 2.5 + 2.5 GeV, after which the colliding beam physics program will be terminated because higher luminosity is available from the Stanford storage ring SPEAR."
"Three modes of injection into the ISA storage accelerators are discussed. The three are: 1) Energy stacking in the ISA. 2) Acceleration of 12 bunches in the AGS followed by single bunch transfer to the ISA. Application of a moving bucket technique then allows the transferred bunch to be brought closer to the bucket train circulating in the ISA. 3) Acceleration on the first harmonic in the AGS. The single bunch is then transferred directly to the ISA into a matched bucket."
"There is reason to expect that nonlinear imperfection resonances may be stronger in a high field superconducting storage accelerator than in a storage accelerator using conventional magnets. A rough study is done to estimate the minimum correction magnets required to correct for resonances up to and including the fifth order. It may be sufficient to have roughly one correction magnet in each cell of the storage ring, with each correction magnet having 12 different coils which are independently excited, and with about 36 independent power supplies. It is also suggested that these correction magnets may be used as all purpose correction magnets and correct for the linear resonances, central orbit displacements, and move the working point υr, υz as well. In this case, about two correction magnets are required per cell, each correction magnet having 21 different windings, and with about 132 independent power supplies required."
"Short bunches are required in electron storage rings. To get them shorter one is tempted to have machines working near transition energy. Then it becomes necessary to watch out for non linear terms because lower synchrotron and betatron stability limits arise. Typical results are given."
"The unstable motion of a bunched beam consists of rigid-bunch (dipole) and higher bunch-shape oscillations of the individual bunches (individual-bunch modes), plus perhaps coupled motion of the different bunches (coupled-bunch modes). Stability is achieved either by decoupling the bunches or by a spread in synchrotron frequencies within a bunch. A stability criterion analogous to the Keil-Schnell criterion for coasting beams is given which includes the effect of a beam interacting with perfectly conducting walls, resistive walls, and resonant structures. Some examples for the CERN accelerators are included."
"In order to verify the theoretical predictions of stability of relativistic proton beams against coherent longitudinal oscillations driven by interaction with the surrounding vacuum chamber wall, a special high-Q cavity was built with remotely controlled tuning and damping. Already the first experiments with the cavity were successful, and the beam was driven unstable at thresholds quite close to those calculated for simplified models. These results also confer more credibility to the claim that it is necessary to continue the costly efforts of keeping the wall impedance low."
"A high energy proton-electron-positron colliding beam system (PEP) will be described elsewhere in an invited paper. It is necessary that the proton beam be stored, tightly bunched in longitudinal space, for many hours. Since there is almost no damping of synchrotron oscillations (for protons), noise which can couple to this motion may cause the protons to diffuse so as to increase the synchrotron amplitude and destroy the tight bunches. This paper describes experiments performed on the Bevatron and attempts to correlate the results with theory. Initial theoretical studies of the effect of noise in the rf system are described in Ref. 1. The theory is extended to include the presence of a feedback control of the rf frequency. Although a properly designed feedback system can suppress coherent synchrotron oscillations of a bunched beam, it is found that the diffusion of particles within the bucket may be unaffected. An obvious source of noise is the rf voltage necessary to maintain the bunched structure. Other noise sources, such as collisions with residual gas, are included."
"Measurements of luminosity at SPEAR, which were performed at different operational conditions of the storage ring are shown and discussed. The parameters varied are: the current in both beams, the minimum betatron amplitude functions at the collision point, the energy and the vertical betatron frequencies. As a result of these measurements we found that the maximum achievable luminosity is much higher than predicted by the incoherent beam-beam limit using δv = 0.025. We also found that the maximum achievable luminosity is a strong function of the betatron frequencies. After computing the largest linear tuneshifts, we found that the quarter resonance seems to be the limiting effect for beam-beam collision."
        "A brief review is given of the various self-field phenomena associated with the longitudinal motion of particles in storage rings."
    "At beam currents above 1.5 × 1011 protons/ pulse in the 8-GeV booster synchrotron, part of the beam is lost during a time interval of 2 to 4 msec just before transition. Particles are lost from several of the 84 rf beam bunches while the number of particles in the other bunches does not change. Electromagnetic coupling between the betatron motion and the magnet laminations which are not shielded from the beam by a vacuum chamber may induce the head-to-tail effect and cause the loss. This effect is sensitive to the chromaticity, ξ = (Δν/ν)/(Δp/p). Changing the chromaticity with dc sextupole magnets at three locations in the ring has eliminated the loss for beam currents as high as 4.5 × 1011 protons/pulse."
"Electrons created by ionization of the residual gas can have initial velocities such that they survive several bunches and experience periodic focusing forces. Applying the AG synchrotron formalism to them shows the existence of regions of stable motion. In the frame of a linear theory one can expect partial neutralization for machines with only a few bunches above transition."
"A pair of pulsed quadrupoles spaced 180° apart in the Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS) ring was installed to prevent the depolarization of polarized protons during acceleration in the ZGS. These quadrupoles must produce a 50-G/in gradient over a useful aperture of 2 in vertically and 10 in radially. The pulse must have a 10-μs rise time and a 2½-ms flattop. They must be pulsed up to ten times during the 1½-s ZGS acceleration period. The computer calculations and the mechanical and electrical design and fabrication of the quadrupoles and their power supply will be described."
 "A symmetric inseretion containing an unusually long unobstructed drift space is described. A consequence of its identity transfer properties in the radial plane (2π betatron phase advance) and its transverse reflection properties in the vertical plane (π betatron phase advance) is its invisibility, neither disturbing the betatron oscillation in either plane for particles of synchronous energy nor disturbing the closed (equilibrium) orbit properties for particles of different energy. Because of the different phase advances in the two planes, the insertion can be designed so that all of its six quadrupole magnets lie at the extreme ends of the insertion. This leaves all of the drift space, excepting only that portion required for coil terminations, etc., in a single unobstructed drift space. A thorough parameter study with linear and aberration properties through third order is reported."
"A method has been developed for the determination of bunching parameters in the frame of a six-dimensional beam-matching to the linac acceptance. In the absence of space charge, initial solutions for the buncher distance, voltage and efficiency, which satisfy the matching requirements, are found analytically or with ancillary computer programs. Then an iterative calculation is applied to solve the more general bunching problem in the presence of space charge. In the above-mentioned analysis, the beam is represented as an entity, described by the second momenta of particle coordinates and velocities. All the forces are linearized; the evolution of r.m.s. values depends primarily on the linear force component."
"The evolution of the beam during capture time is followed by means of numerical methods. The space charge field is obtained by constructing, for purposes of calculation, a rectangular network in the beam. All particles of a given parallelepiped are replaced by a single macroparticle of equivalent charge placed at the centre of the parallelepiped. The field produced by all the macroparticles is then calculated at the knots of the network. The field at any other place is found by interpolation. Beam shapes and distribution of particle densities have been calculated in this way for the CERN synchrocyclotron, at various instants in the vertical plane . The mean accelerated current is calculated."
"Following a method used in plasma physics, a Fourier-Hermite transform is attempted to solve the linearized Vlasov-Poisson equation for small fluctuations of a stationary beam. This expansion method is well fitted to the case of a maxwellian beam confined by linear external forces. As a first approximation, if one retains only the linear part of the space charge forces, the eigenmodes for the small beam oscillations are found in a straightforward way. The associated eigenfrequencies are the roots of a 3-diagonal determinant. The spectrum involves only real and discrete eigenfrequencies, and is similar to the spectrum of a beam with uniform density in real space or in phase space."
"The Courant-Snyder parametrization for one-dimensional linear motion in periodic systems is generalized to two-dimensional coupled linear motions. The 10-parameter 4×4 symplectic transfer matrix across a period is expressed in two normal-mode invariant phase-advances, four normal-mode periodic \"amplitude\" functions, and four periodic functions which reflect the strength and structure of the coupling. These parametric functions are also given by differential equations containing the periodic force coefficients appearing in the Hamiltonian. Two bilinear invariants can be constructed. With given horizontal and vertical aperture limitations, these invariants give the four-dimensional phase-space acceptance volume and the propagation of the horizontal and vertical emittances of the beam."
"Previous treatment of this subject has been given by Hereward and Johnsen. In this note a unified presentation is made of the growth of longitudinal phase area occupied by the beam due to random fluctuations of the magnetic field, radio frequency, and cavity voltage. The description is characterized by a linear treatment of the synchrotron motion, introduction of an envelope function similar to that used in betatron motion, and the use of Nyquist's theorem to obtain power spectra. Application is made to the NAL booster."
"The position of the equilibrium orbit in the NAL synchrotron is measured by sensors immediately downstream of ring quadrupoles. The orbit distortion is corrected at low magnetic field by dc correction magnets located adjacent to the sensors and at high field by transverse displacements of the ring quadrupoles. The inconvenience of moving quadrupole magnets has favored making the minimum number of moves necessary to obtain adequate reduction of the maximum orbit distortion. A few familiar mathematical techniques have proved adequate to calculate the correcting moves, but the combination of these techniques is data dependent. A computer search program invariably gives a solution, but it has been useful to experiment with weighting and smoothing of the data and to compare alternative calculations to insure that the solution is optimum with respect to our priorities and constraints."
"A systematic study of single gap prebunching, including the effects of space charge, has been undertaken, using the second moment of the charge distribution as a measure of bunching action. Generalities of the bunching process are discussed."
  "In a multiparticle variable energy cyclotron there exists a unique sector shape which will provide optimum focussing and isochronism for the full range of particles to be accelerated. To generate this shape, general hard edge equations for the orbit properties are presented. The equations for the betatron frequencies hold for the case when i) the entry and exit spiral angles are unequal ii) the hill and valley fields vary with the radius and iii) for separated sectored cyclotrons also, with the valley field equal to zero. A series of mc2 type spiral sectored electron cyclotron magnets have been constructed and the hard edge equations have been evaluated against orbit integration results in the measured fields."
  "Initial operating experience with the various high power sub-systems is discussed, and the results of electron beam tests at progressive stages of completion of the linac are presented. A highly stable analyzed beam containing greater than 85% of the accelerated current has been demonstrated routinely using ±0.11% analyzing slits at both the 20 MeV and 120 MeV stations. Of particular importance, especially for beam transportation and future considerations of beam recirculation, has been the achievement of an extremely low emittance. Beam measurements at the 20 MeV station have confirmed that essentially all of the accelerated current is contained within an emittance of 7±2×10-4 πmoc-cm; i.e., ~0.2 mm mrad at 20 MeV. System checkout is currently in progress to bring the linac up to its maximum operating condition of 430 MeV at a duty factor of 1.8 per cent."
"We have completed the design and installation of a new bunching system for the Argonne electron linear accelerator originally placed into operation in 1969. It now routinely produces a pulse as short as 40 ps in duration with a charge of at least 7 nC (180A in amplitude) for use with experiments in the very \"short\" time reaction region. Such a pulse is produced over an energy range of 4 to 20 MeV with an accompanying total energy spread of 300 keV. Frequency of production is variable from one single pulse up to a PRR of 800 P/s. Efficiency of acceleration from the gun to the output of the accelerator is 50 percent. Details of the bunching system, including the method of calculation with space charge inclusion, geometrical factors and hardware, and operational results are given."
"The BNL 50-MeV injection linac has been installed as a new injector for the Bevatron. The preinjector, linac modifications, and beam transfer lines are described. The linac and modulator have been modified to permit longer pulse operation at a higher peak current. Most support equipment was already on hand and modified for use."
"In order to increase the peak energy of the Cornell Electron Synchrotron from 10 GeV to 12 GeV, it has been necessary to add approximately 10 MV per turn of acceleration. The system which provides this additional RF acceleration will be described."
"An electron linac has been designed and specified with the beam characteristics tabulated below. It uses three currently available 200 kW CW klystrons and standing wave 805 MHz cavities of LAMPF design, operating with manageable heat dissipation of 0.5 kW per cavity. Beam energy (max.): 40 MeV (duty factor 50%)⪯30 MeV (duty factor 100%) Mean beam power: 160 KW at 30 MeV CW. Short-pulse mode: 160 KW at 2 × 105 pps, 10 ns. Fast neutron flux 5 × 1014/second. (short-pulsed): Monochromated photon 2 × 108/second (50 KeV resol.) flux: At energies above 30 MeV, in order not to exceed power dissipation constraints, duty factor must be reduced. The continuous beam gives the machine outstanding capacity to service a tagged photon monochromator, and a high intensity, high PRF pulsed source of fast neutrons."
 "The energy available from a superconducting linear electron accelerator (SCA) may be increased many times by means of an economical multi-orbit recirculation system, which preserves the most desirable characteristics of the SCA: good energy resolution (~10-4), high current and unity duty cycle. Furthermore, these properties of the SCA and its excellent emittance considerably simplify the design of the transport system and minimize aperture requirements. In order to maintain energy resolution each orbit of the recirculation system must be isochronous with respect to all phase space variables and beams must be reinjected into the linac precisely at the correct phase. These conditions have been achieved in a compact separated orbit design which uses multi-channel uniform field bending magnets. It is suggested that such a device be called a recyclotron. At HEPL a prototype 4 orbit recirculation system is being planned as part of the SCA program. Cost estimates for machines of this type have been made and show considerable advantage over other types of accelerator, especially at very high energies. The configuration also shows promise as an intermediate energy, high current accelerator, which could provide a source for a medical pion therapy facility."
 "An RF separated beam line, Beam 10, for the 12-ft bubble chamber has been constructed at Argonne's ZGS Complex. It utilizes two copper S-band RF deflecting structures, currently separated by a drift length of 31.25 m. The structures are excited from a central high-power RF modulator station, which can provide up to 10 MW of 50 1Ls pulsed RF power to each structure. The beam is instrumented with proportional wire chambers and scintillation counters. The first use of this beam was in taking 100,000 pictures in the 12-ft bubble chamber of 7.14 GeV/c protons where the rejected Π+ contamination was 7%. Currently, tuning studies to provide a separated K-beam at 6.52 GeV/c are taking place. Some pictures of interesting K- interactions in the 12-ft chamber are included. A unique feature of this beam is the use of a fast RF diode switch to turn off the low power RF drive and, consequently, stop the beam when a maximum number of tracks (typically about 10) have entered the chamber. This feature has resulted in an improvement of the picture taking rate of the chamber by 30% o for the 7.14 GeV/c proton run."
"The microwave properties of disc-loaded cylindrical waveguides has been measured for both three and four discs per guide wavelength and normalized phase velocities from 0.5 to 1.0 A graphical presentation of the results is given. A discussion of other results quoted from the technical literature is also included."
"Mesh relaxation computer programs such as the Los Alamos LALA have been developed which determine the Q, shunt resistance and resonant frequency of radially contoured, cylindrical cavities supporting a TM 01-like mode. This program has been used in particular to optimize accelerator cavity designs for the sidecoupled standing wave structure. However, it is also possible to use these cavity designs for in-line structures. In this case ßp = (Vp /C)π, so that, for example, the longitudinal 2π/3-mode at the velocity of light corresponds to the phase velocity 0.66 in the standing wave notation. It is convenient to regulate the energy velocity in this structure by means of circumferential slots between cells, leaving the beam aperture unchanged. This report presents the results of experimental measurements to determine the properties of such a structure in the 2π/ 3-mode."
"An analysis of the microwave properties of an RF cavity, including the effects of beam interaction, is given. The analysis includes the effect of input coupling mis-match and transient conditions. The principal result is that the energy gain must be represented by a cubic expression rather than the quadratic form applicable to traveling wave structures."
"Two bunching schemes are considered in the frame of the CPS Linac, one with a single buncher, the other with a double-drift harmonic buncher. The matching of the beam to the Linac acceptance in six phase-space dimensions is achieved by computer programs in an iterative way: zero current solutions are found first, and then the intensity is progressively raised until 200 mA are trapped into the Linac."
"Various schemes proposed for the confinement of thermonuclear plasmas are reviewed in which it may be possible to generate and maintain the necessary plasma-internal ring currents by strong self-focussed rings of relativistic electrons or protons. Thus, confinement advantages inherent in some of these schemes may become available for an actual fusion reactor. The results of first experiments injecting very-high current beams of relativistic electrons into a magnetic mirror trap show that such electron rings can be generated and give good indications for their stability."
"Penetration of heavy charged particles can be characterized by three basic physical facts: 1) almost no scattering; 2) abrupt increase of linear energy deposition (LET) close to the point where the particles stop; and 3) exact range-energy relationship. These facts constitute the basis of very favorable depth-dose characteristics for heavy ions to be used in radiotherapy. Availability of accelerated high LET heavy ions in the Laboratory, though a recent development, has already provided us with much useful information in physics, chemistry, and radiobiology. Fast heavy ions could previously be studied only in outer space where they form important components of primary cosmic rays. Heavy ions in the Laboratory became available as early as 1957 at the Berkeley HILAC, but at very low energies. In August, 1971, two accelerators, the Princeton Synchrotron1 and the Berkeley Bevatron produced penetrating deflected beams of nitrogen nuclei. Since that time, carbon, oxygen and neon, as well as a few oxygen particles at Princeton, have been accelerated. Stopping-power curves as a function of range for various ions in water, as calculated theoretically, are shown in Figure 1. Various ion energies in units of Mev/nucleon are designated on each curve. The uniformly shaded area represents the stopping-power and associated ions accelerated at the HILAC and cyclotron. The BEVALAC (a compound accelerator formed from the HILAC and Bevatron) adds a new dimension, and initially it will be able to accelerate i ons wi th atomi c no. up to that of iron (Z = 26) to considerable energies."
"In a period of less than ten years, the use of synchrotron radiation in the study of the optical and electronic properties of solids, liquids, and gases has developed from a laboratory curiosity into a widely exploited technique applicable to the needs of investigators working in physics, chemistry, and biology. In this report we discuss the history, present state and future development of this phenomenon in far ultraviolet and soft x-ray research."
"This paper includes a brief review of the theory of stimulated bremsstrahlung by relativistic electrons in a periodic magnetic field, a discussion of the possibilities for a classical interpretation, and a description of the apparatus under construction in W. W. Hansen Laboratories of Physics."
 "In support of Nuclear Safeguards, a 3-MeV Van de Graaff accelerator was installed at LASL to aid research in techniques for nondestructive assay of fissionable materials. Monoenergetic neutrons make possible fissile assay techniques less influenced by self-absorption than thermal interrogation and more discriminating of fissile over fertile material than use of partially moderated high-energy neutrons. Delayed fission-neutron counting, a valuable assay technique, is facilitated by pulsed neutron on-to-off ratios in excess of 109, achieved with special beam-handling techniques. Where high neutron backgrounds, e.g. from samples containing 240Pu, preclude delayed-neutron counting, fission prompt-neutron counting with an energy-biasable detector is applied. The increasing facility workload, which includes detector development and calibration, research in trace analysis by proton-induced x-ray fluorescence and research in light-element isotopic assay by means of charged-particle induced reactions, indicates that technological application may more than supplant dwindling nuclear research as a market for accelerators of this class."
"A picosencond time measurement method is described based on the microwave properties of beams from electron linear accelerators or from possible remodulated external proton beams at proton synchrotrons. A conventional RF separator (RFS) is used operating at the same frequency as the microwave structure of beams and driven by the same master oscillator which modulates the beam. For example, the 2856 MHz microwave at SLAC corresponds to 350 psec between beam RF buckets; accelerated electrons with an RF phase bite of about 5 degrees are time structured and correspondingly have about 5 psec time spread in every 350 psec interval. Charged particles produced in interactions or decays originate with this time structure. An RFS is placed at the last stage of a double focussing spectrometer, providing a lever arm between it and the final (few mm) small spot size focus. Reference calibration charged particles are timed by setting the RFS relative phase to null deflections. Other observed particles arriving at different times than this standardare deflected a few tenths ofa anm per psec of delay. A multi-wire proportional chamber (IMPC) having a 0.05 mm space resolution can provide time measurements with sub-picosecond resolution. The technique is used in an experiment to search for changes in the velocity of light with high energy photons at SLAC. The devised timing method is presented and the properties of a new, fine space resolution MWPC is demonstrated."
"Improvements in intensity and availability of extracted proton beams from high energy accelerators lead to the possibility of forming negative pion beams useful for treating deep-seated cancers. To optimize pion fluxes and design parameters for such beams, an experiment was performed at the Brookhaven Alternating Gradient Synchrotron to measure yields of negative pions produced by protons of 6 to 17 GeV/c incident on targets of different thickness and material. Measurements were made at production angles between 0° and 30° for pion momenta from 150 to 350 MeV/c. A dose rate of 24 rads/min in a 100 cm2 field is attainable at the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron of the Brookhaven National Laboratory."
"A small accelerator which produces high energy (14.7 MeV) neutrons by the H3 (H2, n) He4 reaction has been utilized for two basic biomedical studies. First, fast neutron radiography has been explored as a technique for imaging biological objects. The primary objective was to test the sensitivity of the technique by measuring the differential attenuation coefficient necessary for object identification as a function of the sample thickness. Second, fast neutron radiotherapy experiments were undertaken. Animals with induced brain tumors were treated to observe the relationship between dose fractionation and cell repair. The results are encouraging and indicate the feasibility of further studies with a small accelerator."
"Assessment of the available data indicates that proton radiation therapy has more to offer the patient than existing x-ray therapy. The physical properties of proton beams which allow the major fraction of the dose to be confined to a designated volume are reviewed. Dose delivery schemes employing protons are discussed and treatment plans including dose distributions are compared for protons and x-rays."
"It has been successfully demonstrated that intense bursts of energetic electrons cause significant rock spalling for modest energy inputs. The corresponding temperature rise per pulse in the bombarded volume of rock is only ~ 200° C, or so. Some analytical predictions and experimental evidence of this novel accelerator application are presented. The promise of this technique for more rapid and economical tunneling through rock is also examined."
"Compared with radioactive isotopes, electron accelerators are very powerful sources of radiation. Due to the limited penetration depth of the electrons, these accelerators can only be applied for the radiation processing of surfaces or thin materials. Of special interest is the utilization of low-energy, high-power electron accelerators for the curing of paint coatings on wood, metal, and plastic surfaces. A paint-curing facility was built with a 600 keV electron accelerator with an output power of 60 kW. During the first year of continuous operation, important improvements were made in the entire process, particularly in developing suitable paint and maintaining a pure nitrogen atmosphere in the radiation chamber."
 "Mechanical features, control philosophy, and operational characteristics are described for the automatic, computer-controlled patient positioner \"ISAH.\" This device is presently in operation at LBL's 184-Inch Cyclotron. It is capable of positioning a patient or experimental animal to 0.1 mm accuracies in three dimensions. It can simultaneously or selectively translate the patient in three orthogonal axes and rotate him about two perpendicular axes. Translational motions are 61, 40 and 23 cm respectively while rotations are 400 deg. It is used to deliver a therapeutic dose of radiation from the cyclotron (910 MeV Helium ions) to an arbitrarily defined volume within the patient's body and to manipulate the patient during irradiation so as to minimize radiation exposure of the intervening tissue. The patient motions are under on-line control of a PDP-8/I computer which directs the necessary motions and verifies their performance. The computer may also control a variable thickness water column used to vary the depth of the Bragg peak within the patient."
"A narrow parallel beam of electrons from an accelerator is commonly spread over a useful area by multiple scattering in a thin foil for applications such as radiation therapy and bubble chamber experiments. If the intensity at the edge of the resulting useful field is a fraction x of that in the center, then only the fraction 1-x of the incident beam is used. A secondary scattering foil which intercepts electrons outside the useful field redirects some of these into a distribution which complements that from the primary scatterer, allowing the use of a thinner primary scatterer. The resulting distribution function is developed, in a small-angle approximation, and integrated for annular secondary scatterer elements as a double series which is evaluated by a computer program in terms of the thickness and dimensions of the annulus. Results are discussed and limits of applicability of the theory are pointed out."
"A pion channel has been designed and nearly completed that will provide a good quality, high intensity pion beam of energies up to 300 MeV. Important channel features are a vertical bend plane, close alignment tolerances, short channel length, and remote handling near the production target. These features influenced the mechanical design of the magnets, support and alignment, collimation system, vacuum system, and shielding."
"A five quadrupole, two bending magnet negative pion beam transport channel has been designed to deliver a physical dose of 0.2 rad/sec into a volume of 10 cm × 10 cm × 8 cm thick located at a mean depth of 24 cm. The dose as a function of depth will be varied by a momentum-defining slit which will travel during the irradiation; a second slit in the system will be used to give a sharp lateral cut-off in the dose. Beam size will be varied by appropriately choosing the distances from the second bend to the last quadrupole and from the last quadrupole to the irradiation location. The changes in beam properties due to second-order terms and their correction by sextupole magnets and pole edge curvatures will be described."
"Radioactive tracer measurements have been performed in order to establish limits for the degree of sputtered contamination to be expected during implantation processing in stainless steel target chambers. The information collected provides a useful set of working curves for the particular wafer-holding arrangement employed, and is presented in a form that should be convenient for use in the design of other stainless steel target-holder geometries."

 "A mathematical analysis is presented of a combined liner and spray charge control system for regulating the voltage of the single ended Van de Graaff which forms the injector of the Oxford coupled Electrostatic Generators. The stabilizer design, based on this analysis, incorporates automatic switch-over to an auxiliary generating voltmeter stabilizer loop. An automatic gain control in the slit amplifiers eliminates the necessity for manual gain adjustments in most operating conditions. The voltage stability achieved in operation gave a beam energy stability of ± 7 parts in 105 i.e. 4.447 ± 0.000325 MeV measured using the resonance in the reaction 15N(α , γ)19F. Repeated voltage breakdowns of the HT terminal were prevented by a protection circuit based on the analysis of the breakdown behaviour of the generator. The calculated performance of the circuit has been verified by the observed behaviour after total breakdown."
"At facilities having a research-training reactor, such as the University of Missouri-Rolla Reactor (UMRR), one finds it necessary to perform a large number of rod calibrations during the course of the year. In practice rod worths are determined by measuring the reactor period created by an incremental withdrawal of the rod under calibration. Period is then related to reactivity thru the use of a publication such as the AEC publication, IDO16485. This frequent measurement of period makes it desirable to have a simple, automatic and accurate method to make such measurements. At UMRR we have designed, constructed and installed such an instrument. The instrument measures doubling time rather than period but, thru the use of an internal time base conversion, displays a four bit decimal number that is the reactor period in seconds. The instrument is simple in concept and utilizes the 7400 Series integrated circuits in the largest portion of the unit. The instrument is easy to operate and once initiated, will automatically complete the measurement of the period displaying the results. Error in the instrument can be shown to be less than 1.5%. Thus the unit meets the three requirements of simplicity, accuracy and ease of operation and in addition is moderately inexpensive, less than $120."
"An arbitrary neutron spectrum is changed to a multiplicity of simulation spectra and thereby converted to a reactor equivalent neutron fluence. The method is experimental giving both the magnitude and error of the equivalence. It is applicable to circuits and systems as well as to devices."
"This paper presents a procedure for stability analysis by the Tsypkin Locus method of an unforced control system with relay-type actuator. The procedure was written with special attention given to the minimization of the computation time; thus it may be efficiently executed on a minicomputer. The procedure and a flow chart are presented and the case of a nuclear reactor control is given as an example."
"An improved fast low-power-drain logic system has been developed for use in nuclear experiments on scientific satellites. The basic unit of the system is an AND-NAND gate which has a response in the 10 nanosecond range, a power drain of 2.0 milliwatts and operates over the temperature range of -40°C to +80°C. In addition to providing the AND-NAND logic functions, one or more of the basic units may be connected to yield the following: a. monostable pulse generator, b. pulse generator yielding an output pulse at the leading edge of the input pulse, c. Delay, d. Threshold Detector, and e. Bistable Circuit. The system requires relatively simple circuitry for interfacing at its outputs and inputs."
"A method is described which allows for synchronisation of periodically repeated spinsynchronous measurements with the spin-independent data readout cycle. The method is selfadapting insofar, as it adjusts itself to any spinrate, which the spacecraft may acchieve. Permanent lock relative to the sun allows for directional measurements of particle fluxes in a coordinate system fixed relative to the sun without additional corrections."

 "Examples are given of the use of pulse amplifiers in three areas of experimental nuclear physics. The necessity of low noise at the input of these amplifiers leads to a discussion of electronic noise. The need for pulse-shaping networks in amplifiers particularly designed for accurate amplitude analysis is emphasized. The technique of using negative feedback to obtain nanosecond pulse amplifiers is discussed. Calculated and experimental results are given for two series-shunt feedback pair amplifiers. The necessity of using the hybrid fabrication technique in subnanosecond pulse amplifiers is shown as well as the characterization of the transistors and complete amplifier with the scattering (s) parameters. An annotated bibliography is included as an appendix."

In particular, the paper concerns those techniques which either are being implemented monolithically or have the possibility of monolithic fabrication. Several of these systems are examined in detail and a respective comparison is given between the systems with respect to speed, accuracy, cost, etc."
"Thermally stimulated current (TSC) radiation dosimeters were made from the borosilicate sealing glass used to make transistor headers. These dosimeters, consisting of a metal-glass-metal sandwich structure with electrodes (Kovar or Nicoseal) bonded to the glass with glass-to-metal seals, were experimentally studied to determine how they operate, and how they can be used in the design of a practical dosimetry system. Exposure to ionizing radiation (Co60-gamma or 175 kV X-rays) created trapped charge in the glass. Heating the dosimeter from one side, so as to produce a temperature gradient across the glass, released the trapped charge and produced a TSC which was observed as a TSC vs. temperature glow curve. The integrated charge output from a dosimeter was proportional to the radiation dose. This output for a given dose increased with increasing temperature gradient but was relatively independent of the heating rate. Eiectrodes that were pressed against the glass rather than bonded with a glass-to-metal seal were found to yield large current reversals and thus are unsuitable for dosimetry applications. A simple model is proposed to explain the origin of the TSC and the qualitative behavior of this current. The TSC dosimeter is small, rugged, and inexpensive. Because it produces an electrical output, it requires simpler readout equipment than other dosimetry systems currently available, such as the LiF, TLD system. Its main disadvantage is the rapid fading of the stored charge in the glass at room temperature (~50 percent five hours after irradiation)."
"A pulse amplitude to code converter (ACC) for use in multichannel analysis with a computer based data aquisition systems is developed. A new design concept was choosen based on pulse sampling and storage. The approach has minimum differential and integral non-linearity, maximum stability and modular structure. The pulse storage is done on a switched condenser and the amplitude to code conversion carried out using the up-down integration method. Encapsulated and integrated modules, as well as field effect switches are used in the realization. The resulting ACC is simple, accurate, stable and requires a little development effort. An experimental unit with 1024 channel resolution was built and interfaced to a mini-computer. Tests showed very promising results."

 "When a photon pulse impinges on a cavity, it causes electrons to be emitted from the cavity walls, thereby producing electromagnetic fields in the cavity. This constitutes what is known as Internal Electromagnetic Pulse (IEMP). The produced fields for a given incident photon pulse and spectrum (in the case where transient space charge effects are important) is calculated by means of a particle-in-cell numerical simulation. The calculations are three-dimensional and fully electromagnetic. The calculated fields for pressures of 0.4μ and 720μ show good quantitative agreement with recent underground test results. Both the calculations and the experimental data show that the presence of background gas in the cavity greatly affects the magnitude of the fields in the cavity. At 0.4μ the emitted current is heavily space charge limited and the magnetic fields are comparatively low. At 720μ, the emitted currents ionize the background gas and the secondary currents neutralize the space charge barrier. Then, almost the full emission current traverses the cavity causing much higher magnetic fields. The space charge neutralization process causes the risetime of the fields to be shorter than that of the emitted currents. System implications of these phenomena are discussed."
"Space-charge limiting of current transmission can be neutralized by introducing gas into the diode. The relationship between gas pressure and transmitted current is determined by a combination of several basic physical processes. A model that can predict experimental observations over a wide range of pressures is utilized to show which processes dominate current transmission in various pressure ranges of interest. The quantitative analytical solutions of this model can be correlated with experimental results to yield effective values for secondary electron production, secondary electron drift velocity, electron range effects, and ionization avalanche. Figure 1 shows a typical diode geometry."
"Experimental data on space-charge dissipation due to gas effects has been obtained using electron pulses from an accelerator injected directly through a thin film and a metal screen into a small experiment chamber. The current transmitted across the chamber was measured as a function of gas pressure, gas composition, chamber depth, and electron collector impedance. The measurements generally confirm the theory developed by dePlomb in a companion paper at this conference. Several problem areas are noted that require further investigation."
"Experiments were performed to measure IEMP coupling to cables in small cavities for non-space-charge limited conditions. The experiments were designed to separate the magnetic field, electric field, and charge deposition coupling modes. Investigations were made of the effects of cavity pressure, cable bias potential, and cable type and termination. A theoretical model was developed which represents the various coupling modes by voltage and current sources in a lumped-parameter equivalent circuit. Theoretical predictions were compared to the experimental data. For the configurations investigated the predictions agree with the data to within the experimental uncertainty."
"Recent investigations have been directed toward gaining insight into the effect of electrical pulse overstressing in integrated circuits, especially simple gates and bipolar LSI arrays. In order to determine the effect of ionizing radiation on the pulse-power failure susceptibility levels of small scale, monolithic, junction-isolated integrated circuits (simple gates), an experimental study was undertaken such that device failures could be induced in a simulated EMP or IEMP environment. The device types investigated included low- and high-power, quadruple, dual-input, positive NAND TTL gates. Permanent damage levels for these devices were determined for both positive and negative-polarity sub-microsecond pulses, introduced into the input, output and bias terminals of active devices, some of which were simultaneously irradiated by gamma radiation. The radiation dose rates ranged from 1 × 1010 to 5 × 1010 rads(Si)/sec. The failure susceptibility level of a device was found to depend uniquely upon the ionizing radiation, the device terminal subjected to the electrical stress pulse, and the polarity of the pulse. The data for device failures in the simulated EMP environment agree with the existing thermal-failure models characterized by P = Atm, where P is the power required to induce failure and t is the time to failure. In a radiation environment it was observed that initial ionization tends to reduce the magnitude of the constant A and shifts the time to failure t from the constant-energy regime (m = -1) to another."
"The electromagnetic response of a dielectric-filled finite-length cylindrical cavity, exposed end-on at the Hermes II radiation facility, is experimentally and theoretically examined. Loop sensors were used to obtain azimuthal magnetic field related signals, and a dipole grid sensor was employed to acquire axial electric field related signals. The favorable comparison achieved between the experimentally obtained signals and the theoretically predicted results lends credence to the theoretical model developed."
"Subminiature coaxial cables smaller than RG-58 were exposed to intense pulsed irradiation from a plasma focus device, and the currents induced on the center conductors were measured in a vacuum environment. The incident photons had energies mostly below 70 keV, and filters were used to vary the average hardness of the irradiation. The measured cable responses in units of Coulomb/rad(Si)-cm were compared to values calculated on the basis of photoemission from metal surfaces and electron ranges in insulators. It was found that the currents induced on the center conductors were several times larger than predicted for an ideal coaxial geometry because of small gaps between the dielectric surface and overlapping braid wires. For a given cable type, such as RG-174/U, large variations in cable responses were found according to each manufacturer's construction techniques."
"The theory of multiple dielectric relaxation times in an irradiated transmission line is developed in detail for strip lines and coaxial lines. The problem of deposition profiles, photo-Compton currents, and dielectric properties which vary arbitrarily is treated first; then the treatment is specialized to layered dielectrics. A numerical scheme is given for solving the resulting system of equations describing wave propagation on a line with layered dielectrics. The generalization to a shielded strip line (a three-conductor line) is also presented."
"Techniques for modeling multiconductor transmission lines for use with the SCEPTRE computer program are presented. The transmission line models developed can be modified for compatibility with other circuit/ system transient analysis programs and are amenable to modification to include nuclear weapon effects. The general modeling approach has been to develop computationally efficient and accurate terminal models which can be arbitrarily loaded at the source and load ends and which can be used in conjunction with nonlinear electronic circuit models using either simplified or discrete modeling techniques. The concept of the method is to derive a set of transfer functions in the Laplace domain relating forward and backward traveling waves on the line to voltages and currents at the source and load ends of the line, approximate the transfer functions with a set of orthonormal polynomials, and represent the resulting rational polynomials in the time domain with state variable differential equations. For the multiconductor case, the orthogonal characteristics of wave propagation are used to decouple the modes of propagation except at the source and load boundary condition circuits."
"We have developed a computer program BOLT for the numerical solution of the Spencer-Lewis equation for kilovolt electron transport in finite slabs. The method of solution used is a discrete ordinates method utilizing Gauss-quadrature angles equivalent to a 20th order Legendre polynomical expansion of the electron flux distribution function. The ultimate goal of the program is to compute x-ray photoelectron emission from thin targets and energy and charge deposition profiles near solid-vacuum boundaries and at interfaces between materials of differing atomic number. In this paper results are presented for a uniformly distributed monoenergetic electron source function, anisotropic in angle with form (1 + ß cos θ). The values for the charge and energy flow and deposition profiles agree within a few percent with analytic solutions characteristic of an infinite medium and with Monte Carlo transport calculations using simulated electron trajectories. The equilibrium value for the net flow or \"Compton current\" for 30 kilovolt electrons is found to be about 7 percent higher than the analytic value while all other quantities are believed to be accurate to within 2 percent. The principal source of error appears to be in the evaluation of the collision integral involving the exceedingly narrow deflections characteristic of kilovolt electron scattering. The discretization error due to finite grid sizes in the discrete ordinates scheme used was found to be very small."
"An analytical procedure for describing vacuum photoemission from one dimensional materials more than one electron range thick has been developed. The magnitude, angular and energy distributions are expressed in terms of bulk Photo-Compton current information by algebraic formulae. A semi-empirical equation for the low energy component (<100 eV) is also presented. Comparison with experimental data is good, comparable to that obtained using more sophisticated Monte Carlo codes, except in extreme cases."
"X-rays traversing a material deposit charge near an interface between two different materials. Results of measurement and calculation of these charge distributions are presented. The measurements were made using a planar dielectric-filled Faraday cup. The charge was calculated using primarily the Compton and photoelectric effects, experimental electron ranges, and experimental electron reflection coefficients. The charge distributions near the interface were determined for the Compton, photoelectric, and mixed Compton-photoelectric regimes: for each of these, the x-ray direction was from low to high atomic number and also in the opposite direction."
"The x-ray induced photoemission measurements made at AFCRL have been used as a basis for comparison to the computed results of the POEM Monte Carlo electron transport code. The results show spectral shapes which closely resemble the experimental data and absolute yield values which agree within 15-27%. The measurements have been continued and the angular distributions from irradiated Al and Ta plates have been determined. The Ta distribution function for electron emission changes from cos θ about the surface normal for normally incident x-rays to isotropic for large angles of incidence. The Al in contrast changes from cos θ for normal incidence to a forward lobed shape for large angles of incidence. Both target materials show substantial yield increases at increasing angles of incidence."
"X-ray generated photoemission from thin metal foils backed by graphite was measured with radiation incident from the front and back sides at several angles. Irradiation was provided by a 100-kV x-ray tube with three different filters to harden the spectrum. The total 2 π photoelectron emission current from a surface was measured; a biased grid retarded the low-energy secondary electrons, which added only 10-30% to the current at zero grid bias. Investigated metals were: Mg, Al, Ti, Fe, Cu, Ag, Ta, Au, and Pb; also the total emission from just the graphite support was measured. The front-to-back ratio of emission currents at normal incidence ranged from about 1.9 for Al and Mg down to about 1.1 for Ta. The photoelectron yield was found to be Ge μa Se electrons/photon, where μa and Se are the energy-dependent photon absorption cross section and computed electron mean path length in the emitter, and Ge is a constant assumed independent of photon energy in the range studied (but does depend on radiation angle of incidence). For the photon energy range of 20-70 keV, the measured emission current densities corresponded to the following average values for Ge: 0.37 ± 0.06 for C, 0.30 ± 0.03 for Al, 0.21 ± 0.02 for Cu and Ag, and 0.18 ± 0.02 for Ta."
"Study of the transient behavior of AT-cut quartz resonators following pulse irradiation has been extended. In addition to 125 MHz 5th overtone crystal units previously reported, both 32 MHz and 5 MHz 5th overtone units have been studied using several different oscillator circuits, one of which is designed to give the transient resistance at series resonance, RS, as well as frequency as a function of time after pulse exposure. RS is proportional to the acoustic loss, i.e., Q-1, of the resonator. With but one notable exception, the annealing kinetics of the transient frequency offset following pulse irradiation obeys a t-½ relationship over three to four decades in time, indicative of a 1D diffusion limited trapping of uncorrelated mobile cation impurities in the crystal lattice. The most significant observations of the post-irradiation behavior of RS is the relatively large RS increase in natural quartz resonators. The transient increase anneals asymptotically to a relatively stable RS value which is somewhat higher than the pre-irradiation RS. The transient and steady-state post-irradiation change in RS is frequency dependent and, based upon the underlying model, should also be temperature dependent. The increase of RS in 5 MHz natural quartz resonators exposed to 104 Rad from the Sandia Laboratories' Hermes II facility is 30 times its pre-irradiation value at 0.2 sec after burst. However, RS for 32 MHz crystal units at .2 sec after exposure to 4 × 104 Rad typically increases only a factor of 2 times the pre-irradiation value."
"By comparing results from a computer simulation with experimental data, it is shown that the radiation-induced electrical conductivity (σ) in a dielectric can be written in the form σ=K(γ)γ where K(γ) is a dose-dependent coefficient and γ is the dose rate. The coefficient K(γ) decreases with the dose (γ) due to the internal polarization fields created in the dielectric by the separation of positive and negative charges."
"The radiation-induced voltage buildup in several types of moderate to high working voltage sintered slug Ta capacitors has been found to be significantly modified by the application of reverse bias (Ta electrode -) prior to irradiation. Alteration of the internal field in the Ta2O5 dielectric caused reduced negative voltage buildups in Sprague capacitors and enhanced buildup in Kemet units. To a first approximation the effect varied with the duration of application of bias and reverse leakage through the capacitor at that bias. The effect is eliminated by irradiation of the shorted capacitor to approximately 60 krad(Ta) or by heating to 100°C for approximately 12 h. Some back-to-back series pairs of Ta capacitors also showed radiation response changes after biasing."
"The operation of three types of surface wave acoustic devices; a lithium niobate delay line, a quartz pulse-compression filter and a quartz binary-phase-coded (BPC) delay line, in a nuclear environment are investigated. Neutron irradiation up to 5 × 1015 N/cm2 (E>10 keV) and exposure to 4 × 108 rads of 60Co gamma rays results in no changes. Transient ionizing radiation, occurring at the time when an electrical signal is being converted to acoustic energy, decreases the amplitude and changes the phase of the signal. Once the signal is transmitting in the device as acoustic energy it is generally unaffected by ionizing radiation up to 1011 rad(Si)/sec. However, in the case of the BPC device, functional operation is impaired above levels of 4 × 108 rad(Si)/sec."
"The performance of complementary (n+pp+) silicon TRAPATT diodes has been measured under transient ionizing radiation conditions in both evacuated and airfilled coaxial cavities. Twenty-five watt pulsed, 2.5 GHz oscillators were exposed to 100 nanosecond pulses of 10 MeV electrons at dose rates between 2 × 107 and 4 × 109 rads/sec. The RF power is unaffected below a critical dose rate, which is typically between 8 × 107 and 2 × 108 rads/sec. Above this critical dose rate the RF power is almost quenched entirely during the radiation pulse, but recovers to the original level within 50 nanoseconds afterwards for all dose rates used. Rapid recovery of original RF power levels occurred when the radiation pulse occurred at the initiation of the 300 nanosecond RF TRAPATT pulse, in the middle of the TRAPATT pulse, or during the decay of the TRAPATT pulse. The RF power during the radiation pulse is in agreement with a first order model of TRAPATT operation, in which the principal effect of the radiation pulse is a reduction in mobile charge generated by the avalanche shock front. The decreased mobile charge reduces the time required to remove the trapped plasma and the time necessary for recovery of the diode voltage, thereby decreasing TRAPATT power."
"This paper presents the results of a study on burnout characteristics of n-channel silicon junction field effect transistors as established by electrical pulse injection tests and high dose rate radiation tests. For reverse biased pulse injection tests on JFETs connected in a diode configuration (source and drain tied together), current-mode second breakdown was observed at short failure times (tf<0.1μs) while thermally-induced second breakdown occurred at longer times. The high voltage JFETs tested were found to be much more susceptible to reverse bias pulse injection damage than were the low voltage JFETs (attributed to surface effects). When the gate lead of an actively biased device was driven with a forward biased pulse, the JFET failed due to heating in the pinchoff region of the channel causing a drain-gate short. Under Flash X-ray radiation tests, the diode configuration exhibited photocurrent enhancement near the same current levels at which current-mode second breakdown occurred in the pulse injection tests, but higher power dissipation could be tolerated before device damage was incurred. When irradiated in the active configuration, the onset of photocurrent enhancement resulted in a sustained high current mode which persisted until metallization burnout occurred."
"The permanent ionizing radiation effects resulting from the use of dielectrics to bound FET structures have been experimentally determined for a total ionizing dose up to 108 rads (Si) and for various dielectric isolation techniques. The experimental vehicles used for making these determinations were dielectrically isolated JFET's operated in such a manner that they behaved as a combination junction-MOS field-effect transistor. The experimental results observed by measuring the saturation current, turn-off voltage, maximum transconductance, and channel conductance of the junction FET show a non-monotonic relationship in the effects of a positive charge build-up in the silicon dioxide isolation dielectric with increasing dose. A theoretical model is derived for calculating the interface charge density as a function of the measurable JFET device parameters."
"This paper reports the effects of ionizing radiation on GaAsP MIS capacitor structures fabricated using a thermally grown dielectric and a chromium gate. The devices were irradiated with both Co60 gamma rays and high-energy (0.5 < E < 2.2 MeV) electrons at doses ranging from 104 to 108 rads(GaAsP). Results of studies of charge buildup show that a net negative charge is trapped in the dielectric during irradiation; this contrasts with the positive radiation-induced charge trapping observed in silicon dioxide. Flatband voltage shifts were less than 2 volts up to a dose of 108 rads(GaAsP). This compares favorably with shifts of greater than 10 volts which are noted in typical unhardened silicon structures under similar irradiation conditions."
"The transient response of epitaxial n-channel GaAs junction field effect transistors (JFETs) to ionizing radiation has been investigated. The devices were fabricated from epitaxial layers of n-type GaAs grown on a Cr-doped semi-insulating GaAs substrate. Prior to neutron exposure, the devices were observed to respond to and recover from the ionizing radiation very rapidly, indicating very short characteristic response times. The peak photocurrents in both the gate and drain circuits were observed to vary in proportion to radiation flux at low flux levels, but varied as the half power of flux at higher ionizing radiation rates. The magnitude of the photocurrents indicated that the previously insulating substrate was contributing a diffusion component to the photocurrent. The participation of the substrate in providing photocurrents was confirmed by application of a substrate bias which served to enhance or inhibit the photocurrent response, depending on bias polarity. To aid in interpretation of the complex phenomena observed in the epitaxial JFET structures, a number of more simple device structures were fabricated and their transient response to ionizing radiation was investigated. Neutron irradiation served to reduce the drain and gate photocurrents at all dose rates in the range 109 to 2 × 1011 rad (GaAs)/s but the observed prompt pulse shape was not altered appreciably by neutron exposure. Exponentially decaying photocurrent tails observed in the response of some structures were not present after neutron irradiation."
"Simple calculations show that high-z components such as wires, capacitors, and solder bonds can easily cast shadows with edges only 25 μm wide when illuminated with a low energy (E < 60 keV) x-ray beam. If one of these shadows falls between a photocurrent compensating diode-transistor pair, the mismatch in dose can drastically reduce the transient hardness of the integrated circuit. Results of pulsed x-ray tests on the Texas Instruments RSN 54L 71 R-S flip-flop and RSN 54L 00 quad two input nand gate showed that the upset threshold of a given state of the flip-flop was lowered by as much as a factor of 29 and the nand gate by a factor of 5.7."
"An edge-on diode (EOD) is a dielectrically-isolated lateral PN junction diode formed in a thin (2 μm) layer of single-crystal silicon formed on an insulating substrate. EODs formed on sapphire have extremely low primary photocurrents because the junction areas and minority carrier lifetimes can be made very small. A 16-input analog multiplexer silicon on sapphire integrated circuit was fabricated to evaluate the EOD concept. The multiplexer met all electrical specifications and proved very fast, settling within 60 ns. While circuit radiation testing is not yet complete, individual diodes tested at a dense plasma focus x-ray source showed individual diode photocurrents of only about 100 μA/1011 rads (Si)/s."
"Measurements of minority-carrier lifetime degradation have been made for neutron-irradiated silicon which permit the following stable-damage comparisons to be drawn: a) test vehicle (device vs. bulk material); b) material type (n-type vs. p-type); c) dopant density (data obtained for various resistivities); d) neutron energy (14-MeV vs. reactor); e) measurement technique (transient vs. steady-state); f) operating condition (data obtained over a wide injection-level range). Primary results of this study are the following: a) the 14-MeV-to-reactor stable damage ratio is insensitive to injection level for a given resistivity; b) measurements of the stable damage ratio were made for bulk silicon and solar cells of various resistivities and nearly all of the values obtained were in the range 2.3 ± 0.4; c) neutron damage constants for solar cells and bulk material of a particular resistivity are in reasonable agreement if comparison is made at the same injection ratio, provided that the ratio employed is high enough so that such comparisons are not affected by bulk trapping."
"Disordered regions are highly effective for recombination in neutron-irradiated silicon and germanium. Extension of an earlier analysis is presented which takes into account the effect of recombination on the local carrier concentration, and qualitatively explains various experimental observations, particularly the variation of lifetime with excess density. Comparisons to Gregory's impact model are made, and arguments are presented which favor the present analysis. It is observed that the previous conclusion that impurities are unimportant for recombination in neutron-irradiated material may not be valid for practical situations which involve high excess carrier densities."
"Bulk measurements of minority carrier diffusion length in irradiated n-type silicon have been made to determine damage constants for comparison with those derived from photoconductivity decay measurements and to investigate behavior at large neutron fluences. Photoconductivity decay measurements were consistent with those performed previously, while the diffusion length damage constants were consistent with those previously observed on solar cells. Differences in the two sets of values are ascribed to trapping effects and to the higher injection level prevailing in the transient measurements."
"The nature of the lattice damage in boron-implanted intrinsic silicon has been studied as a function of 140-keV 11B+ ion fluence using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). At most of the boron fluences, the observed EPR spectra consisted primarily of neutral 4-vacancies (Si-P3) and of unresolved E spectra (defects unknown). Concentrations (number/cm2) for the Si-P3 and Σ paramagnetic defects have been determined as a function of ion fluence for fluences ranging from 5 × 1012 to 1016 11B+/cm2. At the highest fluences the beginning of an isotropic resonance indicative of amorphous silicon was also observed. However, only a trace of the amorphous resonance was observed, and this resonance was found to be broadened and shifted to a lower magnetic field with a g value of 2.0071 instead of the usual 2.0055. Also observed at the higher fluences was the new anisotropic spectrum (labeled Si-SL3) arising from a defect having D2d symmetry. Finally, isochronal annealing studies indicate that the Si-P3 and Σ concentrations decrease toward zero by a 225° C anneal in a manner similar to that previously observed for oxygen-implanted-silicon. No paramagnetic defects were observed in the 600 to 900° C range. It is concluded that any electrical activity annealing in the 600 to 900° C range is primarily a result of a decrease in the number of compensating non-paramagnetic or diamagnetic defect centers."
"An 80° K 5-MeV electron irradiation of n-type Hg1-xCdxTe produced an increase in donor density, Hall mobility, and apparent bandgap, Prior to irradiation, the donor density was 2.6 × 1014 cm-3 and increased linearly with electron fluence, with an introduction rate (dn/dΦ) of 5.7 cm-1. The 80° K preirradiation Hall mobility of 5.78 × 104 cm2/V-sec initially increased with irradiation, saturating at a value of about 1.1 × 105 cm2/V-sec for Φ = 4 × 1014 e/cm2. The irradiation-induced changes in the Hall mobility and donor density show a nearly complete recovery to their preirradiation values during isochronal anneals to 340° K. An apparent shift in bandgap to higher energy of ~0.035 eV was noted in photoconductivity data following irradiation and partial anneal. This shift in bandgap disappears during anneal, and results in a bandgap value slightly smaller than the preirradiation value after annealing to 340°K. Arguments are given to correlate the apparent bandgap increase and possibly the increased 80°K Hall mobility that is observed after irradiation and prior to anneal, with the onset of degeneracy as the carrier density increases with irradiation."
"Impurity ions (H+, He+, B+, O+, A+, Kr+, and Xe+) have been implanted in high-purity vitreous silica and their production of and interaction with implantation damage was studied by optical absorption techniques. An absorption band at 245 nm (B2-band) is produced by all ions except H+. The implantation of H+ greatly reduces the B2-band absorption intensity produced either by prior or subsequent sample implantation with heavier ions. For ions other than H+, the intensity of the B2-absorption increases with increasing ion mass for a given ion fluence and suggests that the defect giving rise to this absorption is generated by ion energy going into displacement processes. The spectral position of the implantation-induced B2-band is identical with that of a band found in impure as-manufactured fused silica. The band in impure silica is believed to be due to a center consisting of a trivalunt metallic impurity (e.g., Al3+) substituting for Si4+ and an adjacent oxygen vacancy. The results of the present investigation suggest that the implantation induced defect producing the B2 band in high-purity silica is an oxygen vacancy at which the binding electrons of the two adjacent Si atoms can be trapped. If the B2-band is also associated with SiO2/Si interface states in MOS devices as has been suggested, the present results may offer a possibility for reducing the density of these states by H+-implantation."
"Band-tailing produced by electron irradiation at room temperature has been studied in various semiconductor materials using infrared absorption. The bandtailing can be produced by both 30- and 1-MeV electrons. GaAs is quite sensitive to the production of band-tailing, and InSb and Si show a lesser effect. PbTe and Ge show no band-tailing produced by these irradiations, but this is more likely due to the annealing of the necessary defects at this relatively high temperature than to any inherent material insensitivity. The annealing of the band-tailing has been studied and is found to occur primarily in several well defined stages. These stages can often be correlated with the annealing stages of isolated defects. Photoconductivity results show that the band-tailing is an absorption phenomenon. This result agrees with previous calorimetric measurements. A hypothesis involving absorption at states produced by disorder in the crystal near the band edge is put forward to explain the various aspects of band-tailing."
"Following a brief outline of magnetic bubble domain technology and possible radiation effects, the results of radiation effects experiments are presented. Permanent damage experiments on materials consisted of characterizing samples of Y3 (FeGa)5O12, Er3(FeGa)5O12, and (YGdTm)3 (FeGa)5O12 films before and after exposure to neutrons from a TRIGA reactor and to Co60 gammas. Parameter measurements included saturation magnetization, wall energy, defect density, wall mobility, coercivity, and saturation velocity. No significant changes in these parameters were observed after 1015 n/cm2 (1 MeV equivalent) and 5 × 107 rads. Permanent damage experiments on devices included measurements of propagation and annihilation margins, and domain sensor output (for shift registers) before and after exposure to reactor neutrons and Co60 gammas. Again no significant change was found after 4 × 1014 n/cm2 (1 MeV equivalent) and 5 × 107 rads for devices with hard-bubble suppression. Magnetoresistive parameters of a thin, permalloy domainsensor film were also unchanged after 1015 n/cm2 and 5 × 107 rads. Information stored in a shift register was read electrically immediately before and after exposure to a 30 ns pulse of 1.5 MeV electrons with a dose of 3 × 104 rads(Si) and found unchanged. A similar experiment, using optical determination of the stored information, indicated no change after a 1.7 × 105 rad pulse."
"An improved technique for estimating solar cell degradation in a space environment is presented. The equivalent fluence is defined and the relative damage coefficients are evaluated for solar cell output parameters with approximations appropriate for the use of normal incident experimental data. The equivalent fluences are calculated for sample cases to demonstrate the degradation of I-V curve."
"Measurements of light-generated current versus cell temperature on electron-irradiated n/p silicon solar cells show the temperature coefficient of this current to increase with increasing fluence for both 10Ω-cm and 2Ω-cm cells. A relationship between minority-carrier diffusion length and light-generated current was derived by combining measurements of these two parameters: 1) versus fluence at room temperature, and 2) versus cell temperature in cells irradiated to a fluence of 1 × 1015e/cm2. This relationship was used, together with the light-generated current data, to calculate the temperature dependence of the diffusion-length damage coefficient. The results show a strong decrease in the damage coefficient with increasing temperature in the range experienced by solar panels in synchronous earth orbit; i.e., 200 to 330°K, and a significant temperature dependence of the ratio of the damage coefficient for 2Ω-cm cells to that for 10Ω-cm cells."
"Infra red photon-induced electrical performance degradation of several types of commonly used silicon solar cells has been studied with respect to 1 Mev electron fluence dependance, photon intensity, dopant atom type and concentration, and silicon growth (crucible grown or float zone). Proton irradiated cells have also been studied. Laboratory electronphoton degradation data is compared with flight data from the ESRO satellite HEOS A1 and the U.K. Satellite PROSPERO. The culprit minority carrier recombination centres remain, as yet, unidentified but it has been found possible to fabricate stable silicon solar cells by employing either high quality, low dislocation density silicon or aluminium rather than boron doped base silicon."
"A study has been performed on P/N lithium doped silicon solar cells to develop a mathematical model for the annealing of radiation damage. Experiments with low energy protons (0.25, 1.0, and 2.0 MeV) indicate that the annealing rates of proton damage are a function of the local position of damage within the solar cell base. Compton electron studies were used to determine introduction rates for annealable and unanneable damage. Pulsed 10 MeV electron tests permitted the observation of short circuit current recovery from 1 to 105 seconds for comparison with the mathematical model. These data are used as inputs into a diffusion limited reaction model of the defect annealing phenomena. Nonuniformities of the dopant profiles within the solar cell base are accounted for by a two-region model of the solar cell base. The two-region model of the solar cell using the diffusion limited reaction theory of annealing yields equations which describe the short circuit current recovery in lithium doped solar cells very well for both electron and proton damage."
"Closely compensated GaAs light-emitting diodes utilizing Zn-Si and Si-Si impurity combinations have been used to study the effects of both gamma and neutron irradiation on the radiative light generating mechanism as well as on the carrier lifetime and injection mechanism in these diodes. The following results have been noted: 1) the light-generating mechanism appears to be affected more strongly by 60Co irradiation than by neutron irradiation; 2) the shallow-lying acceptor radiative center (Zn) appears to be more susceptible to 60Co irradiation than the deeper-lying center (Si); 3) neutron irradiation appears to introduce non-radiative centers which primarily affect the lifetime and injection mechanism. A means of radiation hardening GaAs light-emitting diodes by isovalent substitutional alloying of phosphorus is reported. A minimum reduction in quantum efficiency on neutron irradiation occurs for the alloy composition GaAs.70 P.30."
"Fast-neutron irradiation induced time delays in the turn-on of the optical output pulse of diffused GaAs laser diodes have been observed. The results are explained using a double-acceptor model that predicts the delay's functional dependence on fluence and that also accounts qualitatively for the observed temperature dependence of the delay. Little neutron damage induced change occurs at LN2 temperature, where the delay is thought to be a result of the time required to establish the population inversion, the double-acceptor traps being inactive. At high temperature the increase in delay with fluence appears to be caused by introducing more traps at a rate proportional to the number already existing. A \"pivot\" operating point can be found at which the diode time delay is almost unaffected by damage to > 1014 n/cm2 (> 10 keV)."
"New data are reported for the neutral bulk lifetime of electrons in neutron-irradiated p-type silicon. The measurements are made in special uniform-base transistors and n+p gated diodes. The resistivity range of 0.2 to 9Ω-cm is covered. In the higher resistivity samples, injection levels of slightly greater than unity are achieved. A range of neutron fluences from 1013 to 1015 n/cm2 (E > 10 keV) is examined and the lifetime damage constant is found to be fluence independent. The data are compared with previous bulk and solar cell measurements."
"Very low energy neutrons (E < 1 eV) were found to produce damage to pnp silicon transistors comparable to that produced by fast neutrons (E > 10 keV). The effectiveness of thermal neutrons was quite varied; ratios of thermal-to-fast neutron damage constants from less than 10-3 to nearly unity were obtained. The damage mechanism was tentatively identified to be the result of a [B10 (n, α) Li7] reaction in the emitter region of the device whereby energetic alpha and Li particles are emitted and subsequently produce damage in the base region of the device. The role of the lithium recoil was identified to be responsible for the large observed damage ratios; however, even larger ratios are possible for certain types of devices."
"The radiation sensitivity of MIS capacitors with pyrohydrolytic A12O3 insulators has been investigated for X-irradiation at 300 and 80K. Both X-rays and light of various photon energies were used to vary the populations of electron and hole traps inherent in the \"as prepared\" films. The energies of the trapping levels have been determined and the spatial distribution of the electron traps within the oxide estimated. These traps together with an SiOx layer at the semiconductor-oxide interface are shown to control the device behavior under ionizing radiation."
"Experimental measurements directed at understanding oxide modifications induced by Na+ and Al ion implantation are described. Both implanted species created high dark conductivity in unannealed specimens. This had a temperature dependence independent of ion type suggesting that the conductivity is related to displacement damape. Internal photoemission studies showed that Na+ implantation had produced a barrier lowering at both interfaces and also permitted sub-threshold photoemission starting with photons of about 1 eV. Thermal annealing returned the oxide to its insulating state and removed the sub-threshold photoemission. Photo-depopulation measurements indicated that the oxide still contained electron traps not present in the unimplanted samples."
"The parasitic transistors and pnpn paths present on junction-isolated CMOS circuits have been identified and studied quantitatively. Active SCR structures exist which can be triggered electrically or by a radiation pulse. Detailed studies of SCR paths have been performed on two circuits, the CD4007A and the CD4041A, to relate geometrical and materials parameters to latch-up sensitivity. Both normal bias conditions and bias optimum for obtaining SCR action are employed. Several techniques are proposed to eliminate radiation-induced latchup in future CMOS designs."
"The radiation sensitivity of commercial and laboratory CMOS processes has been investigated. Failure levels for CMOS circuits have been related to transistor threshold voltage shifts and typical inverter failure modes. CMOS inverter characteristics have been measured as a function of the ionizing radiation exposure for devices fabricated by 10 different manufacturers and representing a total of 15 different processes. By selecting certain processes, CMOS circuits can be obtained which will operate after exposure to an ionizing radiation dose greater than 106 rads (Si)."
"The effects of ionization on MOS devices as a function of time after exposure to a radiation source are functions of the radiation source and device bias time profiles. This paper presents a discussion, supported by a comprehensive series of experiments, of the time dependence of ionization-induced damage to complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) devices. Two distinct annealing or recovery mechanisms were investigated: (1) room temperature annealing in the absence of radiation, and (2) radiation enhanced room temperature annealing. Experiments were performed using both electron aid γ-ray sources with ionization rates ranging from 103 rads(Si)/sec to greater than 1011 rads(Si)/sec and observation times extending from 1 msec to 105 seconds. The experiments demonstrate that ionization-induced damage to positively biased MOS devices, such as the n-channel devices in CMOS circuits, can be annealed appreciably at room temperature by additional irradiation of the device with zero gate bias. Thus, when operation of CMOS circuitry during or immediately following radiation exposure is of interest, the experimental semipermanent-type radiation damage data typically reported must be carefully evaluated."
"Silicon-on-Sapphire (SOS) construction reduces junction photocurrents to such low levels that other radiation-induced currents tend to dominate the response of an SOS circuit to transient ionizing radiation. The results of experiments and calculations suggest that photoconduction of the sapphire substrate accounts for most of the observed \"excess\" currents internal to these circuits - while gas ionization effects are significant at the external device terminals."
"The effects of ionizing dose on MOS device parameters at 90°K are much greater than at 0°C. This behavior is well predicted by the model and analysis developed by Mitchell - provided that the mobility-lifetime product, for electrons near the oxide-silicon interface, is chosen to give a best fit between experiment and theory. From the data on zero-biased and positively-biased devices, this product is Tu 8 ±2 x 10 16i 2/V at 90°K. This value is an order of magnitude greater than that reported by Mitchell for a room-temperature thermal oxide. No direct determination of the AT product near the metal-oxide interface can be made, but it is estimated that it is about a factor of ten larger than that indicated above. The data also show a bias dependence for the form of space charge distributions at both interfaces. At the oxidesilicon interface, the bias dependence of the charge distribution can be explained by assuming that some charge trapped very near the interface is neutralized by electrons tunneling from the silicon under the influence of the high field in that area. At the metal-oxide interface, the charge is compacted near the plate for increasingly negative voltages. Preliminary isochronal annealing data from 90°K to 300°K show that most of the damage anneals out at -2000K. The residual damage is less than that present after irradiation of equivalent devices to the same dose [1 Mrad(Si)] at 0°C."
"Two different techniques have been used to measure absolute electron energy deposition profiles in semi-infinite geometries. The first, employing an ionization chamber, was used to measure energy deposition by normally incident electrons at incident energies of 1.0, 0.5, and 0.3 MeV in aluminum, and 1.0 MeV in tantalum. The second method is unique in that it represents the first calorimetric measurement of energy deposition from a monoenergetic D. C. source. Results are given for normally incident electrons at an incident energy of 1.0 MeV in aluminum, and at incident energies of 1.0 and 0.5 MeV in tantalum. The latter method circumvents some of the difficulties inherent in the ion chamber technique and provides more precise results."
"Recently developed methods to improve the usefulness of pulsed nuclear reactors as sources for simulation of wide pulse ionization environments, generated by weapon produced neutrons, are described. These methods include the use of a special shield material which performs the dual role of attenuating neutrons and enhancing gamma dose rate, tailoring of pulse shapes by modifying the reactor burst characteristics through selective coupling between the reactor core and special reflector configurations, and use of special shield configurations to improve dose uniformity. Data obtained at the White Sands Missile Range Fast Burst Reactor and the Sandia Corporation SPR II for several shield configurations and reactor operating conditions are presented. Gamma radiation dose rates and 1 MeV damage equivalent neutron fluences obtained with and without use of the special shield material are compared. Dose rate enhancements of 5.2 and 3.3 times free fields were achieved behind shield thicknesses of 5 and 12 in., respectively. The respective neutron fluences were reduced by factors of 5.5 and 62. A peak dose rate enhancement of 12.4 times free field was achieved between slabs of shield material. Peak dose rates of 5 × 107, 1 × 107, and 1.2 × 106 rads(Si)/sec were achieved behind the shield material for pulse widths of 52 μsec, 100 μsec, and 1 msec, respectively, while limiting the neutron fluence to approximately 1 × 1011 n/cm2."
"A measurement of the neutron energy dependence of base current of a small signal bipolar transistor is given. The theory of the method, the neutron radiation damage calibration and measurement, the neutron dosimetry, and an experiment to test the concepts and to obtain preliminary results are described."
"When considering neutron-induced damage to transistors, it is desirable to relate the damage caused by one spectrum to that of another. Recent experimental work shows that the damage curves based on displacements in bulk silicon are an over simplification when applied to devices, and give significant errors. Using the experimental technique described in this paper, it is possible to compare the damage of different spectra using the actual device parameter of prime interest. Results obtained using this technique show that damage induced in devices involves several damage mechanisms and is more complex and severe than that predicted from displacements alone. While damage ratios for different spectra may be quantitatively obtained, a totally satisfactory explanation for the increasing damage for spectra becoming increatingly \"harder\" is not presently available. The difficulty of explaining the damage ratios obtained that are larger than anticipated is compounded by the fact that these ratios appear to be dependent upon the operating point of the device, the device parameter used as a basis, and possibly the device type."
"This paper describes a study of the homogeneity of neutron response as a function of the level at which parts are sampled, i.e., over several diffusion runs, several wafers within a single diffusion run, a single wafer or parts within a wafer. The results indicate that variations in neutron response across a wafer may be comparable to those of a diffusion run or production lot. However, homogeneity within an area comparable to that of a \"standard\" SSI integrated circuit is shown to be quite good and it appears that circuit neutron response can be predicted to within ~10% by the use of 100% electrical screening of radiation correlation parameters on a specially bonded transistor within the IC chip (breakout transistor). Variations within an area on a wafer somewhat larger than that of an SSI chip are large enough to indicate that the breakout transistor approach may not be useful for prediction of the neutron response of MSI or LSI circuits."
"A frequency domain model of the common emitter S21 parameter of a junction transistor is derived which includes the effect of minority carrier transit time through the active device. Using this model it is demonstrated that the minority carrier transit time can be measured using scattering parameters. S-parameter derived transit time is used to predict neutron induced gain degradation. A prediction accuracy of approximately 5% is demonstrated."
"The results of an irradiate-anneal study for screening power transistors for neutron degradation are reported in this paper. The results of this study on 100 RCA TA8007 power devices indicated that very good predictions could be made for the neutron gain degradation, where the gains were measured within the capability of standard probe measurements. The observed neutron degradation of the package transistor gains closely matched that of the same transistors measured at the wafer stage, indicating that \"soft\" devices would be rejected prior to packaging if screens were imposed at the wafer stage. The optimum annealing condition for an irradiation fluence of 3.62 × 1013 n/cm2 (E > 10 keV) was 350° C for four hours. Failure analyses (MTBF tests) indicated that the reliability of those devices are practically unaffected by the additional stresses required to implement an irradiate-anneal hardness assurance program."
"This paper demonstrates the locally inhomogeneous neutron response of wafer nearest neighbor transistors and integrated circuits. Published data on irradiated silicon devices is reanalyzed to show the variation of neutron degradation which can typically be expected when no controls over base width are kept during device processing. Several 100% screens are suggested as alternatives to breakouts and sample screening."
"The electron beam technique used by Czaja to analyze defects in diode structures has been applied to the analysis of surface anomalies occurring in Schottky-barrier particle detectors. An output map of the detector surface showing local variations in sensitivity was obtained in this manner. It was discovered that characteristic anomalies give characteristic displays. Specifically, SEM analysis was useful in detecting: 1. Chemical contamination of the detector surface. 2. Mechanical damage of the detector's semiconductor wafer substrate, 3. Damage introduced in semiconductor surface preparation, 4. Radiation damage, and 5. Defective surface metallization. The possibly damaging effects of scanning electron beam irradiation are discussed. A general limit on beam current and magnification setting for a 20 kev beam is given. If this limit is not exceeded, the technique does not, in itself, add artifacts to the electron beam technique display. Methods are developed which enable the quantification of the extent and severity of surface damage. How these methods can be used to eliminate some common processing problems is also covered."
"The performance of 500 milliwatt X-band injection locked IMPATT oscillators, exposed to 100 nanosecond pulses of 10 MeV electrons at dose rates between 1 × 108 and 3 × 109 rads/sec, is compared to free running IMPATT oscillators. The RF power reduction during the radiation pulse remained the same for the locked and free running oscillators, while the RF frequency shift depended upon the power of the locking signal. The locking figure of merit remained constant over the range of dose rates used, and original RF performance was regained within 50 nanoseconds following the radiation pulse."

"In 1970, Knuth, Pratt, and Morris [1] showed how to do basic pattern matching in linear time. Related problems, such as those discussed in [4], have previously been solved by efficient but sub-optimal algorithms. In this paper, we introduce an interesting data structure called a bi-tree. A linear time algorithm for obtaining a compacted version of a bi-tree associated with a given string is presented. With this construction as the basic tool, we indicate how to solve several pattern matching problems, including some from [4] in linear time."
 "A linear recursive program consists of a set of procedures where each procedure can make at most one recursive call. The conventional stack implementation of recursion requires time and space both proportional to n, the depth of recursion. It is shown that in order to implement linear recursion so as to execute in time n one does not need space proportional to n : ne for arbitrarily small e will do. It is also known that with constant space one can implement linear recursion in time n. We show that one can do much better : ne for arbitrarily small c. We also describe an algorithm that lies between these two: it takes time n.log(n) and space log(n). In this context one can demonstrate a speed-up theorem for linear recursion - given any constant-space program implementing linear recursion, one can effectively find another constant space program that runs faster almost everywhere."
"The inclusion problem for the class of monadic recursion schemes is shown to be undecidable, thus answering an open question of Paterson [5]. The proof depends upon a construction similar to one used showing that the question \"is L1 ⊆ L2 ?\" is undecidable for context-free languages L1, L2."
"This paper attempts to use formal semantics of a class of parallel processes in order to carry out mechanizable proofs about them. The formalism used is LCF (Logic for Computable Functions, Milner [22]), with slight extensions. The processes we consider communicate by sharing memory, rather than by signals on communication lines. Parallelism is treated as nondeterminism. We state properties such as mutual exclusion of critical sections, absence of deadlocks, determinacy, and we show examples of proofs."
"The Investigation of Chow parameters is extended to pseudothreshold functions. Pseudothreshold logic is a generalization of threshold logic. Chow parameters are a set of n + 1 integers derived from a Boolean function of n variables. The main results are: 1. Two different pseudothreshold functions with the same Chow parameters have the same optimum structure. Thus, the optimum structures of pseudothreshold functions can be cataloged using Chow parameters. 2. The set of positive threshold functions is a subset of the set of positive, zero-free, pseudothreshold functions which is a subset of the nonnegative, nontrivial pseudothreshold functions which in turn is a subset of the measure minimum functions. 3. The set of positive threshold functions is a subset of the Intersection of the set of positive Chow unique functions and positive, zero-free, pseudothreshold functions. 4. The sets of positive Chow unique functions and the positive, zero-free, pseudothreshold functions are subsets of the Chow maximum functions which in turn is a subset of the positive Boolean functions."
"This paper deals with hazards on outputs of combinational circuits without feedback for multiple input changes. A procedure is given to decompose a Boolean function into a feedback free circuit. The procedure either gives a logic hazard-free circuit or shows that the Boolean function cannot be broken down into a feedback free circuit which is free of logic hazards for multiple input changes."
"A synthesis method for multiple-input change asynchronous sequential machines is proposed. The method is based on the self-synchronization principle. The internal states are realized with edge-sensitive flip-flops which are triggered selectively. The new concept of selective triggering or controlled excitation results in considerable saving in logic and more flexible design. The state assignment is arbitrary, and the number of state variables required can be made absolutely minimum."
  "Neighborhood search has been used with some success in providing approximate solutions to discrete optimization problems. The technique produces solutions which may be locally but not globally optimal. For a particular class of problems this paper describes a method for analyzing the relative effectiveness associated with different neighborhoods in terms of the probability that a local optimum is in fact global. The analysis is then applied to the 5-city Travelling Salesman Problem for which two neighborhoods of like size are compared. It is found that local optimality with respect to one of these neighborhoods is roughly twice as likely to indicate global optimality as is local optimality with respect to the other. It is felt that further development of the techniques described in this paper might lead to computer designed heuristics for certain discrete optimization problems."
"At the heart of a number of arithmetic complexity problems are some basic questions in tensor analysis. Questions regarding the complexity of multiplication operations which are n-linear are most easily studied in a tensor analytic framework. Certain results of tensor analysis are used in this paper to provide insight into the solution of some of these problems. Methods are given to determine a partial ordering on the set of tensors corresponding to a partial ordering with respect to complexity on the set of n-linear operations. Different classes of algorithms for evaluating n - linear operations are studied and a generalized cost criterion is used. Algorithms are given for determining the rank of a class of third order tensors and a canonical form for such tensors is presented. Bounds on the complexity of a wide class of operations are also derived."
  "Although the field of \"canonical parsing\" (i.e. parsing in which we always reduce the leftmost phrase of a sentential form) has been extensively studied, the field of non-canonical parsing has been relatively untouched, In this paper, we first motivate the whole study by presenting a language which is intrinsically non-canonical and then we develop a general model of bottom-up parsing which incorporates the capability of making non-canonical reductions. These parsers have the important properties of operating in linear time and of being implementable on \"traditional\" automata. Finally, in section 3 we extend several existing parsing methods to utilize our ideas and examine the relationships between the various classes so produced."
 "The principal result described in this paper is the equivalence of the following statements: (1) Every set accepted by a nondeterministic one-way two-head finite automaton can be accepted by a deterministic two-way k-head finite automaton, for some k. (2) The context-free language LPΣ (described in the paper) is recognized by a (log n)-tape bounded deterministic Turing machine. (3) Every set accepted by a L(n)-tape bounded nondeterministic Turing machine is recognized by a L(n)-tape bounded deterministic Turing machine, provided L(n) ≥ log n. This work extends results reported earlier by Hartmanis [2], Savitch [9,10], and Lewis, Stearns, and Hartmanis [6]."
"Complexity of sentence recognition is studied for one-way stack languages, indexed languages, and tree transducer languages. The problem is shown to be polynomial-complete in each case. A class of naturallanguage grammars is formalized and the sentence-recognition problem is shown to be polynomial-hard although the languages are context-sensitive. The proofs give new language-theoretic characterizations of the set of satisfiable propositional formulas and the set of prepositional tautologies."
"This paper investigates the possibilities of the resolution method of J.A. Robinson [12] as a decision procedure for classes of first-order formulas. It is shown here that resolution, a machine-oriented inference procedure, can be modified to be a method which decides whether certain kinds of quantificational formulas are satisfiable or unsatisfiable. A new complete resolution technique is presented and is demonstrated to be a decision procedure for satisfiability for many previously studied solvable classes. Most proofs are omitted, but may be found in [6]."
"The paper presents an algebraic theory of graph-grammars using homomorphisms and pushout-constructions to specify embeddings and direct derivations constructively. We consider the case of arbitrary directed graphs permitting loops and parallel edges. The gluing of two arbitrary labeled graphs (push-out) is defined allowing a strictly symmetric definition of direct derivations and the embedding of derivations into a common frame. A two-dimensional hierarchy of graph-grammars is given including the classical case of Chomsky-grammars and several other graphgrammar constructions as special types. The use of well-known categorical constructions and results allows simplification of the proofs and pregnant formulation of concepts like \"parallel composition\" and \"translation of grammars\"."
"A notion of one computable function (not) helping the computation of another is defined in terms of the lattices of honest subrecursive classes. It is said that two honest computable functions do not help each other's computation if the intersection (meet) of the subrecursive classes which they generate is the zero subrecursive class; that is, two functions do not help each other's computation if they have trivial information content in common. One honest subrecursive class is said to be the pseudo-complement of another if it is the maximum class which has trivial information content in common with the other. A technical characterization is given of those honest subrecursive classes for which there are non-zero honest subrecursive classes with trivial information content in common with them. Further, it is shown that for every non-zero honest subrecursive class there is an effective, increasing sequence of honest subrecursive classes which have trivial information content in common with it, and this sequence is cofinal upwards with the set of all honest subrecursive classes which have trivial information content in common with it. Although there is always an upper bound to the set of classes which can have trivial information content in common with it, there may or may not be a maximum class with this property."
"We investigate the size of sets of computable functions using category-theoretic methods (in the sense of the Baire Category theorem). Constructive definitions of no-where dense and meagre set are given and applied to several problems. In particular we apply it to subrecursive degree structures and to a comparison of the power of deterministic and nondeterministic time bounded oracle machines."
 "There are several situations that we are trying more or less to model. One arises from the standard IQ test in which a person is given a finite sequence of integers and asked to produce the next integer in the sequence. Another is provided by the following grossly simplified view of one aspect of physics: Consider a physicist who is trying to find a law to explain a growing body of experimental data. This data is presented as a set of pairs (x,y). Here, x is a description of a particular experiment, e.g., a high energy physics experiment; y is a description of the results obtained, e.g., the particles produced and their respective properties. The law describing these phenomena is essentially an algorithm for computing the function f(x) = y. What an inductive inference machine does is to request and obtain data in the form of pairs (x,y) and then use this to look for an algorithm i that computes (an extension of) f. Other examples arise in grammatical inference, pattern recognition, etc. This paper develops inductive inference along the lines of Solomonoff [9], Gold [4], and Feldman [3]. What is new and distinguishes our work from theirs is our attempt to characterize the set of functions that can be identified by an inductive inference machine. In the process, we have discovered (Theorem 4, part 1) that inductive inference machines can be considerably more powerful than we previously thought possible."
"Decision procedures for validity in intuitionistic propositional calculus and modal propositional calculus are given which require a running time proportional to a polynomial in the length of the formula on a nondeterministic Turing machine. Using a theorem of Cook's and well-known transformations from intuitionistic to classical and modal to intuitionistic logics, the validity problem for intuitionistic and modal logics is shown to be polynomial equivalent to the validity problem for classical logic."

  "A (d, r) circuit is a d-valued logical circuit in which each element has fan-in at most r and can compute any r-argument d-valued logical function in unit time. In this paper we review results previously published on the computation time of such circuits for addition and multiplication and for computation of general Boolean functions. We also explicitly state hitherto unpublished but known results on the time necessary to divide in such circuits."
"The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that representations of numbers other than positional notation may lead to practical hardware realizations for digital calculation of classes of algorithms. This paper describes current research in the use of continued fractions. Although practicality has not been demonstrated, theoretical results are promising."
"This paper describes a family of algorithms for evaluation of a class of elementary functions including division, logarithms, and exponentials. The main objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of higher radix implementations, in particular, radix 16, and to compare performance with radix 2. The emphasis is not on optimality of a single algorithm, but rather on the optimality of a class of algorithms. An attempt to implement a much wider class of functions than is presently done in arithmetic units is encouraged by the current level of digital technology and the existence of suitable algorithms. Besides the definitions of the algorithms, which are based on continued products and continued sums, details related to implementation are discussed."
"A set of arithmetic algorithms is described for operands that are encoded in the ``AN'' error-detecting code with the low-cost check modulus A = 2a - 1. The set includes addition additive inverse (complementation), multiplication, division, roundoff, and two auxiliary algorithms: ``multiply by 2a - 1,'' and ``divide by 2a - 1.'' The design of a serial radix-16 processor is presented in which these algorithms are implemented for the low-cost AN code with A = 15. This processor has been constructed for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory STAR computer. The adaptation of ``two's complement'' arithmetic for an inverse-residue code is also described."
"A single format for the representation of numbers in a computer is proposed to accommodate both exact and inexact quantities. A consistent set of rules is described for addition (subtraction), multiplication, and division of such quantities, both within their separate types, as well as in combination. Error correlation aside, the propagation of inherent errors is monitored in operations with at least one imprecise value. A definitive algorithm must, of course take into account any correlations of inherent errors; these correlations must be recognized and incorporated into the algorithm by the numerical analyst, not by the logical designer of the computer."
"In this paper we discuss directed roundings and indicate how hardware might be designed to produce proper upward directed, downward directed, and certain commonly used symmetric roundings. Algorithms for the four binary arithmetic operations and for rounding are presented, together with proofs of their correctness; appropriate formulas for a priori error analysis of these algorithms are presented. Some of the basic applications of directed roundings are surveyed."
"The accumulated roundoff error incurred in long arithmetic computations involving a randomized mixture of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations applied to an initial randomly generated data base is studied via simulation. Truncated and rounded floating-point arithmetic and truncated and rounded logarithmic arithmetic are simultaneously utilized for each of the computation sequences and the resulting roundoff error accumulations for these four systems are compared. The nature of the correlated errors incurred under various arithmetic operator mixes are discussed."
"The appearance of hexadecimal floating-point arithmetic systems has prompted a continuing discourse on the relative numerical merits of various choices of base. Until lately this discourse has centered around the static properties of the floating-point representation of numbers, and has primarily concerned only binary and hexadecimal representations. Recent events may change this discourse considerably. A third numerically attractive alternative for the choice of base has been proposed, and a comparison of the dynamic numerical properties of floating-point arithmetic systems has been completed. This paper surveys these recent events and summarizes our current knowledge of the numerical characteristics of floating-point arithmetic systems."
"For scientific computations on a digital computer the set of real numbers is usually approximated by a finite set F of ``floating-point'' numbers. We compare the numerical accuracy possible with different choices of F having approximately the same range and requiring the same word length. In particular, we compare different choices of base (or radix) in the usual floating-point systems. The emphasis is on the choice of F, not on the details of the number representation or the arithmetic, but both rounded and truncated arithmetic are considered. Theoretical results are given, and some simulations of typical floating-point computations (forming sums, solving systems of linear equations, finding eigenvalues) are described. If the leading fraction bit of a normalized base-2 number is not stored explicitly (saving a bit), and the criterion is to minimize the mean square roundoff error, then base 2 is best. If unnormalized numbers are allowed, so the first bit must be stored explicitly, then base 4 (or sometimes base 8) is the best of the usual systems."
"A procedure is presented for performing a combinatoric fixed-integer division that satisfies the division algorithm in regard to both quotient and remainder. In this procedure, division is performed by multiplying the dividend by the reciprocal of the divisor. The reciprocal is, in all nontrivial cases, of necessity a repeating binary fraction, and two treatments for finding the product of an integer and repeating binary fraction are developed. Two examples of the application of the procedure are given."
"The replacement problem arises in computer system management whenever the executable memory space available is insufficient to contain all data and code that may be accessed during the execution of an ensemble of programs. An example of this is the page replacement problem in virtual memory computers. The problem is solved by using a replacement algorithm that selects code or data items that are to be removed from executable memory whenever new items must be brought in and no more free storage space remains. An automaton theoretic model of replacement algorithms is introduced for the class of ``random partially preloaded'' replacement algorithms, which contain certain algorithms of practical and theoretical interest. An analysis of this class is provided in order to evaluate their performance, using the assumption that the references to the items to be stored are identically distributed independent random variables. With this model, it is shown that the well-known page replacement algorithms FIFO and RAND yield the same long-run page-fault rates."
"A new approach is presented for the design of multiple fault detection tests in which the structure of a combinational circuit is used to reduce the number of input combinations required. The structure is defined by the interconnection of the basic elements, each of arbitrary complexity. The fault model assumes that the functions realized by the basic elements may undergo any deviation whatsoever, but that the circuit structure is fault free. Thus, arbitrary combinations of multiple faults within one or more basic elements are included in the model. Decomposition theory can be used to verify that a set of input combinations is a multiple fault detection test set under this model. A process called expansion will be introduced to simplify this task. A well-defined procedure is given for deriving a suitable test set which for some circuits is minimal or near minimal. It will yield a multiple fault detection test of length less than 2n for any circuit with a nontrivial nondisjoint decomposition, defined by a basic-element partition. Higher order basic-element partitions are introduced as a generalization. An upper bound is given on the length of a multiple fault detection test for any circuit with a given structure, independent of the function realized on the structure. The bound is tighter when function information is also used."
"Conditional-sum addition in a -2 base system and its comparison with normal binary conditional-sum addition is discussed. It is found that approximately 2.0 to 2.5 times as much hardware is required for this high-speed addition method in the negative binary system as compared to the positive binary system."
"Some comments are made on the above note,1 to indicate that the decomposition relations used in this technique can be obtained in a much simpler way and to point out that the technique has been mentioned earlier in the literature."

 "In this paper a procedure for forming high-accuracy Gaussian distributed pseudorandom numbers is presented, and a digital system that mechanizes the procedure is suggested. The high accuracy that is obtainable while maintaining high output rates, makes the proposed method comparable to the established software generation methods so far as speed and accuracy are concerned. The approach that is suggested is one that is central limit theorem oriented. Error compensation is provided so that accuracies can be better than 3 percent to within ±4 standard deviations from the center of the distribution, and better than 5 percent at ±6 standard deviations. A formula describing the output of the system is derived and tabulated results are presented. The system can find application as a peripheral device of a general-purpose computer in simulation studies as well as in all fields where high-accuracy Gaussian noise generation is required."
"A tour in a machine is a shortest input sequence taking the machine from some initial state, through all of its remaining states and back again into its initial state. A best upper bound for tour length is found for two types of machines: n-state sequential machines with unrestricted input alphabet and n-state sequential machines with a two-letter input alphabet. The problem of finding a best upper bound for length of tours in machines is restated and solved using the language of the theory of directed graphs. The solutions to the above special cases restated in this language seem obvious but require a nontrivial proof of their status as solutions."
"The problem of decomposing an arbitrary permutation of a large number of elements into a number of permutations of smaller numbers of elements has become important recently in rearrangeable switching networks and in interconnectors for computer peripheral and processing units. Opferman and Tsao-Wu have published an algorithm for decomposing an arbitrary permutation of n = d × q elements into d permutations of q elements each and (2q - 1) permutations of d elements each. The following is a modified version of their algorithm, wherein a matrix, called the allocator matrix, each of whose elements is a set of integers, is used for obtaining the d permutations of q elements each; and a simpler way of obtaining the (2q - 1) permutations of d elements each is given. The modified algorithm is similar to the backtrack procedure in combinatorics and leads directly to an APL program for any divisor d of n."
"This paper proposes that all data elements in a computer memory be made to be self-identifying by means of a tag. The paper shows that the advantages of the change from the traditional von Neumann machine to tagged architecture are seen in all software areas including programming systems, operating systems, debugging systems, and systems of software instrumentation. It discusses the advantages that accrue to the hardware designer in the implementation and gives examples for large- and small-scale systems. The economic costs of such an implementation for a minicomputer system are examined. The paper concludes that such a machine architecture may well be a suitable replacement for the traditional von Neumann architecture."
"It is shown that the number of maximal false vertices and minimal true vertices is the minimum number of tests required to detect all s-a-1 and s-a-0 faults in any irredundant two-level realization of a 2-monotonic function."
"The design of fault-tolerant asynchronous networks has been an unsolved problem. In this paper, necessary and sufficient conditions on state assignments for fault-tolerant asynchronous networks are given. Three design techniques, based on Liu's 2so - 1 assignment, Friedman et al.'s (2, 2) separating system, and (2so + 1) assignments, are given for fault-tolerant asynchronous networks. The earlier Liu's upper bound on state variables for USTI assignment for 2so rows is improved to 2so - 2so-3."
"A hybrid special-purpose computer based on a recursive algorithm for discrete Walsh transform computations is described. The device uses feedback in time to reduce the required number of summing junctions to N, the number of data points to be transformed. Computations are completed in 700 μs when N = 256."
"A model for two-dimensional linear iterative circuits is defined in the form of matrix equations. From the matrix equations, a two-dimensional characteristic function is defined. It is then proved that a matrix satisfies its two-dimensional characteristic function. This property is used to form a diagnostic matrix. Finally, the diagnostic matrix is used in a minimization technique."
"The problem considered is the development of a method of scene analysis that employs a descriptive approach in the analysis of pictures. In an effort to facilitate implementation of the algorithm to a wide range of picture classes, a description of the scene is read in as data in the form of a tree structure that guides the search for objects from the largest to the smallest. The algorithm has the following features: the analysis of the scene is top-down; feature extraction and pattern recognition are combined in a reinforcing system; the algorithm contains a description of the class of scenes to be analyzed; region enumeration techniques are used in primitive object identification; principal parameters in the program are self-adjusting; and the concept of ``field of vision'' is used to locate the boundaries of objects. The algorithm has been implemented and tested on posteroanterior (PA) chest radiograms, anteroposterior (AP) knee radiograms, and lateral brain scans. The analysis of PA chest radiograms is used to describe the implementation of the program. To date, the algorithm has been tested only on radiographic images; however, the method should also be applicable to other image classes."
"Waveform segmentation is treated as a problem of piecewise linear uniform (minmax) approximation. Various algorithms are reviewed and a new one is proposed based on discrete optimization. Examples of its applications are shown on terrain profiles, scanning electron microscope data, and electrocardiograms. The processing is sufficiently fast to allow its use on-line. The results of the segmentation can be used for pattern recognition, data compression, and nonlinear filtering not only for waveforms but also for pictures and maps. In the latter case some additional preprocessing is required and it is described in [19]."
"The direct conversion of an analog signal to its digital representation in base (-2) is considered. A successive approximation version strategy is developed and applied to a practical converter that is described in detail."
"It is shown that associated pairs of vectoral items (Q(r), X(r)) can be recorded by transforming them into a matrix operator M so that a particular stored vector X(r) can be reproduced by multiplying an associated cue vector Q(r) by M. If the number of pairs does not exceed the dimension of the cue and all cue vectors are linearly independent, then the recollections are perfect replicas of the recorded items and there will be no crosstalk from the other recorded items. If these conditions are not valid, the recollections are still linear least square approximations of the X(r). The relationship of these mappings to linear estimators is discussed. These transforms can be readily implemented by linear analog systems."
"A correction to the Gray code-to-decimal conversion of Davies is given, which follows from Davies' own proof if performed on the level of operations on wave number indices. An alternative proof for Walsh functions as combinations of Rademacher functions is also given, starting from the definition of Walsh-Kaczmarz functions."

  "In this paper we briefly describe and compare a number of theoretical models for parallel computation; namely, Petri nets, computation graphs, and parallel program schemata. We discuss various problems and properties of parallel computation that can be studied within these formulations and indicate the ties between these properties and the more practical aspects of parallel computation. We show how marked graphs, a particular type of Petri net, are a restricted type of computation graph and indicate how some results of marked graphs can be obtained from known results of computation graphs. Also, for schemata we discuss the decidability versus undecidability of various properties and several techniques of schemata composition."
"An extension of Petri nets called evaluation nets (E-nets) has been developed for use in representation of computer systems. These lead to interpreted graphs for use in human communication and to machine-interpretable descriptions. They may be used as aids in development of simulations and planning of measurements for examining characteristics such as throughput, turnaround time, and utilization of resources. This paper reviews the five primitives used to form nets expressing logical interactions among tokens (or tasks) flowing through the net and system resources represented by the net. Inherent in the use of the primitives is the ability to express time delays associated with the flow of tokens through the network and the modification of attributes of these tokens. This paper extends previous work on evaluation nets through the use of macro nets that represent structures made up of the primitives, allowing compression of the net for easier understanding. The macro nets are ``open-ended'' in the sense that the user can develop new macros to suit the needs of a particular study. Evaluation nets can be used informally like flow charts or block diagrams, although they provide greater power of expression than either. They can also be used more formally to develop machine aids, e.g., for on-line editing of evaluation nets or for development of simulation programs. Some examples of evaluation nets are provided that model a CDC 6400 and the cooperation of n independent sequential processes."
"This paper investigates some of the effects of varying the number of central processing units (CPU's) available to a multiprogramming system both when parallel processing of a single task (multitasking) is allowed and is not allowed. The variables investigated are those that would be expected to control the CPU queue length distribution and include the degree of multiprogramming, CPU service discipline, CPU service distribution, the degree of cooperation between processors engaged in multitasking, and the ratio of CPU to I/O service capacity. The computer systems are modeled by queueing networks. Analytic results are displayed in many cases with supplementation by numeric and simulation solutions when convenient or necessary. It is demonstrated that under properly defined conditions doubling the number of CPU's in a system can more than double throughput. The effectiveness of multitasking in improving throughput is found to be fairly small if the degree of multiprogramming ranges from modest to high."
"Conventional time sharing and multiprogramming systems have been extensively modeled as single-server queues. In contrast, multiprocessing systems must be modeled as multiserver queueing systems. This paper investigates the effect of the scheduling strategy-a key parameter-on the performance of multiserver queues, under very general assumptions: arbitrary arrival process and arbitrary service times distribution. We distinguish two classes of queue disciplines: preemptive and nonpreemptive, and two types of arrival processes: dependent (on the state of the queue) and independent. The performance is evaluated in terms of global measures: the utilization factor of the servers, as a measure of internal efficiency, and the mean response time, as a measure of external (user-oriented) performance. It is shown that nonpreemptive disciplines leave both measures invariant, for given but arbitrary (dependent or not) arrival process and arbitrary service distribution. For preemptive disciplines, the utilization factor is invariant only if the arrival process is independent, while the mean response time depends on the discipline, whatever the arrival process. It is also shown that the exponential distribution is the only distribution for which the queue discipline does not affect the performance of the system, thus underlining the very peculiar nature of this standard assumption and preventing us from safely generalizing the conclusions reached under this assumption. A quantitative comparison of preemptive and nonpreemptive disciplines requires an analytical solution, for which a general technique is presented."
"Two problems of importance for the scheduling of multiprocessing systems composed of identical units are discussed in this paper. 1) Given a partially ordered set of computations represented by the vertices of an acyclic directed graph with their associated execution times, find the minimum number of processors in order to execute them in a time not exceeding the length of the critical path of this graph. 2) Determine the minimum time to process this set of computations when a fixed number of processors is available. A unified formulation for lower bounds on the minimum number of processors and on time is presented. These lower bounds are sharper than previously known values and provide a general framework that gives insight for deriving simplified expressions. A new upper bound on the minimum number of processors is presented, which is sharper than the known bounds. The computational aspects of these bounds are also discussed."
"A formal technique for the representation of tasks such that the potential concurrency of the task is detectable, and hence exploitable, during the execution of the task is described. Instructions are represented as a pair of binary vectors d and ê which completely describe the sources and sinks specified by the instruction. Tasks are represented as square matrices M called ordering matrices. The values of the elements of these matrices are used to dynamically indicate the necessary ordering of the execution of instructions. It is shown how several different types of ordering matrices, each type having the capability of exhibiting different amounts of potential concurrency, can be calculated from the d and ê vectors of the instructions of a task using ``linear algebraic-like'' operations. For example, intercycle independencies can be detected with a ternary ordering matrix. This matrix can be extended to dynamically detect opportunities for reassigning the resources specified by certain instructions to increase the amount of potential concurrency. Experimental results are presented showing the relative capability of each of these matrix types for exhibiting potential concurrency. These techniques are shown to produce somewhat greater amounts of potential concurrency than other known dynamic techniques. However, the amounts of potential concurrency found are less than those reported for preprocessing detection techniques."
"In multioperand additions p summands can be compressed into q summands by adding along the columns independently. For a given column Z with Boolean elements {zi}, this sum is Σrk2k, where rk equals a residue threshold function R(2k, 2k+1 |Z), defined by the proposition R(t, m |Z) ≡ t ⩽ (Σzi) mod m. The hardware realization is particularly simple using symmetry-adapted READ-ONLY storage (ROS) array logic."
"This paper describes a unique associative memory mechanism in which a data base may be simultaneously searched by comparison with a substantial number of key words, or ``comparands,'' as contrasted with the usual one-comparand-at-a-time limitation. Possible search criteria include the six arithmetic relations, plus certain logical ``bit-set'' relations. At some cost in both hardware and speed, each of the comparands may be provided with an associated mask field and/or search specification. Optionally, the set of comparands may be included within the set of data items, thus allowing cross comparisons amonag the comparands. In all cases, the location and length of the comparison field may be freely programmed within the available word size, and a master mask may be provided, without time penalty. Algorithms for one-comparand searches and ``memory arithmetic'' operations can also be implemented with little additional hardware. The mechanism is bit-serial, word parallel, so that search time is proportional to the number of bits actively compared, but independent of the number of comparands or data items. At each bit position to be compared, the set of data/comparand pairs is partitioned into four cases, corresponding to the four possible combinations of bit values. Each case is processed separately, one after another, but with all similar items being processed in parallel for each case. Each of the different comparison criteria defines a function, which in turn specifies how to modify the search results at each step. A table of function definitions is provided, listing most useful searches."
"In order to use the Illiac IV array processor efficiently it is necessary to have different types of data management techniques than those which are used in a serial computer. This paper describes the data organization and management techniques that were developed for a particular real-time application. The particular problems considered are: 1) the tracking of objects at different rates; 2) the rearrangement of data sets as rates are changed and objects are inserted or deleted; and 3) the ``association'' of new returns with existing tracks. The techniques described here are for a particular application but they illustrate the kind of techniques required for parallel array processors and they may be generalized to a number of other potential applications."
"This paper describes the recent development of parallel processing algorithms for solving optimal control problems for nonlinear dynamic systems. Both the deterministic and stochastic cases are considered. The resulting algorithms are applicable to a large range of parallel architecture computers, including Iliac IV, associative processors, and potential designs based on integrated circuit technology."
"An mth-order recurrence problem is defined as the computation of the series x1, x2, ..., XN, where xi = fi(xi-1, ..., xi-m) for some function fi. This paper uses a technique called recursive doubling in an algorithm for solving a large class of recurrence problems on parallel computers such as the Iliac IV. Recursive doubling involves the splitting of the computation of a function into two equally complex subfunctions whose evaluation can be performed simultaneously in two separate processors. Successive splitting of each of these subfunctions spreads the computation over more processors. This algorithm can be applied to any recurrence equation of the form xi = f(bi, g(ai, xi-1)) where f and g are functions that satisfy certain distributive and associative-like properties. Although this recurrence is first order, all linear mth-order recurrence equations can be cast into this form. Suitable applications include linear recurrence equations, polynomial evaluation, several nonlinear problems, the determination of the maximum or minimum of N numbers, and the solution of tridiagonal linear equations. The resulting algorithm computes the entire series x1, ..., xN in time proportional to [log2 N] on a computer with N-fold parallelism. On a serial computer, computation time is proportional to N."
"The matrix decomposition Poisson solver is developed for the five-point difference approximation to Poisson's equation on a rectangle. This algorithm's suitability for parallel computation, its simplicity, its performance relative to successive overrelaxation, and its generality are then discussed."
"A new type of double-rank synchronous sequential machine is introduced in this paper. Its dissimilarities and similarities with the other types (Types 1 and 2) of double-rank sequential machines are discussed along with the relative merits of each type. Providing a striking example of the advantages of this new type (called Type 3) double-rank machine is a new kind of binary counter, which is highly reliable, fast, and efficient. Circuit realizations of Type 3 double-rank sequential machines can be derived by using a slight variation of a method presently used for Type 2 double-rank machines. This paper shows how the method can be markedly improved."
"It is known from a paper by Das that multiform total symmetry is equivalent to linearity. In this correspondence the results of Das are generalized and a simple proof is given to show that even for multiform partial symmetries the corresponding subfunctions are linear subfunctions."

 "Constrained least squares estimation is a technique for solution of integral equations of the first kind. The problem of image restoration requires the solution of an integral equation of the first kind. However, application of constrained least squares estimation to image restoration requires the solution of extremely large linear systems of equations. In this paper we demonstrate that, for convolution-type models of image restoration, special properties of the linear system of equations can be used to reduce the computational requirements. The necessary computations can be carried out by the fast Fourier transform, and the constrained least squares estimate can be constructed in the discrete frequency domain. A practical procedure for constrained least squares estimation is presented, and two examples are shown as output from a program for the CDC 7600 computer which performs the constrained least squares restoration of digital images."
"Cellular arrays composed of identical cells with uniform interconnections are presented. The basic cell is a switching device with two inputs, two outputs, and two control variables x and T. The cell structure is either purely combinational or with unit delay depending upon the control variable T. The control variable x sets up either a ``crossing mode'' or a ``bending mode'' in the cell. Thus a two-dimensional cellular array without time delays has the connection capabilities of a crossbar switch. Any combinational switching function can be realized by appropriate choice of control variables while the inputs to the edges of the plane are fixed. Alternatively, the control variables can be fixed while the inputs to the edges of the cellular plane are varied from function to function. A cubic array is constructed from a set of identical cellular planes packed one upon the other such that the control variables applied to the first plane will penetrate to all other planes without time delay. It is shown that any k functions of the same variables can be synthesized on such a cubic array. By allowing the control variable T to delay some signals in the array, such a cubic array can be used to realize any synchronous sequential machine with single or multiple inputs and/or feedback functions. Any defective cell in the array can be tested and isolated. The array can be stripped, divided, or interconnected."
"A measure of the minimum cost of a logical network is important in the evaluation of such networks. A hypothesis is investigated which states that the average minimum cost depends on both the number of input variables and the entropy (``entropy'' in this sense is based on the probability of a ``1'' in the functions' truth table) of the function realized. Some experimental results are presented to support the hypothesis."
"The study of fuzziness in combinational switching systems by means of a suitable fuzzy algebra is discussed. The insufficiency of the methods for simplification of fuzzy functions as presented by Lee and Chang [9] and by Siy and Chen [10] is discussed. A new technique for minimization of fuzzy functions is developed. Special properties of fuzzy functions are discussed and their relationships to two-valued logic are investigated."
"It is shown that in a residue system with only the two moduli m-1 and m+1, base extension to modulus m is possible with savings in time and sometimes in hardware over conventional techniques. It is also shown that the underlying theory generalizes to provide comparable savings when extending any system with two moduli nm-1 and nm+1 (where n may be any integer) to include the third modulus m. For systems with more than two moduli, the savings are obtained in sign detection and partial base-extension operations. Savings are also possible during other residue operations (e.g., scaling, magnitude comparison, and overflow determination) in which sign detection and base extension are used."
"This paper examines the problem of finding a single universal test set that will test any of a variety of different implementations of a given switching function. It is shown that, for AND/OR networks, universal test sets may be found that detect not only all single faults but all multiple faults as well. The minimality and size of these sets are examined and their derivation for incomplete functions is described."
"Threshold-type retrieval functions have been suggested by many people and used widely in clustering algorithms. In this paper, a discriminating capacity is defined for these retrieval functions. Explicit methods for computation are presented. The discriminating capacity is useful as a quantitative measure for the retrieval power of each function and can serve as a guide for selection."
"The problem of minimizing the bit dimension of control memories in microprogrammed digital computers is considered in this paper. We start essentially with the same basic formulation as that of Grasselli and Montanari [2]. However, in order to minimize the computational requirements, we start directly with the set of maximum compatibility classes of microcommands whose number is usually small, and readily obtain near-minimal irredundant solutions. A minimal solution is then obtained from the irredundant solutions."
"A processor called Boolean analyzer has been presented at the 1968 IFIP Congress to introduce parallel processing of Boolean expressions [1]. The present paper shows how to increase its speed many times by making its processing more parallel. The applications of the Boolean analyzer are limited to few but important problems. A typical problem of that kind: listing of all implicants of a function of 7 variables defined by not more than 100 term implicants (of the complement of that function) takes only about 40 μs (supposing a delay line storage working at the clock impulse rate of 2.106/s)."
"A brief review of the principles of optical data processing (ODP) with its high throughput data rate and parallel processing potential is given, followed by a description of a viable on-line electron-beam addressed electrical-to-optical input transducer. A proposed on-line hybrid digital/optical two-dimensional processing system is then described. An output plane optical-to-digital interface and several applications of the system to high bit-rate on-line data processing situations are included."
"A piecewise linear function is represented in terms of a set of linear functions through the use of the maximum and minimum functions. A procedure for finding piecewise linear discriminant functions for pattern recognition is described. The procedure iteratively uses the accelerated relaxation method to find every linear function in a piecewise linear function. The procedure was implemented by a Fortran program. Experimental results with the program showed that the procedure is promising for obtaining piecewise linear discriminant functions."
"A modification in the algorithm for the detection of totally symmetric functions as expounded by the author in an earlier note1 is presented here. The modified algorithm takes care of a limited number of functions that escape detection by the previous method."
"This correspondence identifies the definitions of the above paper in mathematical terms. Both algebraic and logical terms are given."
"It is pointed out that the number of scalar multiplications (additions) required to evaluate a matrix chain product depends on the sequence in which the associative law of matrix multiplication is applied. An algorithm is developed to find the optimum sequence that minimizes the number of scalar multiplications. A program is written for use on the CDC 6600 computer to implement this algorithm and also to carry out the chain product according to the optimum sequence. Several examples are included to illustrate the algorithm. The saving in computation and improvement in accuracy that can result from the use of this algorithm can be quite significant for chain products of large arrays and in iterative solutions of matrix equations involving chain products."
"A solution is presented for a class of a very large system of linear algebraic equations. The given set of simultaneous equations is initially transformed to yield an equivalent system of equations in triangular form whose solution is straightforward. With the present technique, the number of operations on the computer is minimized while the convergence to a unique solution is guaranteed."
"A more compact and structured way of obtaining the boundary conditions for iteratively realized sequential circuits is presented. The notion of a ``predecessor tree'' is used."

"A nonlinear picture-to-picture transformation is introduced and compared with a straightforward linear transformation. The criterion for comparison is based on the desire to smooth noisy or textured regions while retaining edge definition. Selected examples from a large number of simulations are presented. The transformation presented is believed to be superior to many techniques presently being employed."
"The optimal state assignment procedure by Story, Harrison, and Reinhard [1] depends computationally on the number of distinct state assignment columsn Cdi, i = 1, 2, ..., C(R). C(R) can be computed exactly by see the [Eqa] in pdf file but a bound for C(R) is shown to be C(R) = 2R-1 - 1 for R - 1 =2n. Furthermore, for this value of R a distinct state assignment set can be tabulated instead of generated; i.e., Cdi = Ci, i = 1, 2, ..., C(R)."

 "This allegorical case study is a reminder that a re-examination is likely to be less effective than action on the first examination; that anybody can be goaded to a minor mutiny; and that removing the critic does not remove the problem. It is also a reminder that the best-intentioned executives can simultaneously dodge the system and be astonished when someone else dodges it."
"The cassette recorder, now well established in the home-entertainment and dictating-machine fields, is beginning to make a significant impact in digital data recording. Within the next few years, tape cassette recorders should take over a large part of the market at present served by punched paper tape."
           "Only by making use of completely new operating philosophies can the optimum use be made of new technical developments in high-speed guided transport systems. By judicious choice of routes and modes of operation, a 400 km/h railway network in the UK is a feasible proposition"
  "Delivering letters and parcels, most people would think, should be quite an easy business. But the hugh volume of mail now being handled by the British Post Office presents particular difficulties in a labour-intensive industry. Can these problems be solved by more mechanisation?"
 "There is no doubt that, when it comes to successful management, British industry has considerable room for improvement. Many people would claim that one way of improving management skills is to increase the number of management schools in Britain and send more managers on special courses. Andrew Cooper, a man who learned his management in practical situations, is not so sure."
    "Communication in an industrial organisation - both between management and employees and between the different levels of responsibility and different functions - is essential for the wellbeing of the organisation, and it is up to management to see that a comprehensive and efficient 2-way communication system operates."
     "The application of digital computers to the control of industrial processes has come a long way since the first historic steps were taken over 12 years ago.

                     "In the UK, electricity consumption has increased approximately 5½ times since 1948. In this shortened version of his IEE presidential address, A. G. Milne reviews the improvements in scale, efficiency and reliability of distribution engineering practices within the Area Boards in England and Wales, which serve some 19 million consumers."
"Whatever process or system man invents in the realms of science and technology, he can be sure that Nature has thought of something similar billions of years ago. As electronics begins to have significant and far-reaching applications in many fields, the electronics engineer is starting to study Nature's processes in order to overcome the various problems he faces."
 "Shortly after the Second World War, with the advent of the semiconductor, the swift demise of the electromechanical relay was predicted by the knowledgable pundits of that time; but just how wrong this prophecy was is now a matter of history. Since that time many new devices have been developed and many established units have been updated."

                                                    "Centralised control points can be an effective means of reducing accidents and congestion on motorways, if they are provided with a surveillance system to collect information on motorway conditions and a control system to advise motorists of what action to take. Different types of system have to be provided for rural and urban motorways because of the different problems involved."
 "Transmission-line characteristics for coaxial lines and waveguides are readily calculated. For lines such as microstrips, coplanar waveguides and slot lines, calculations are more difficult to make. Several recent innovations, such as the network analyser, have made this job easier"
        "In 1913, one trade unionist in five was a miner; today, one trade unionist in three is a white-collar worker. What effect has this changing pattern had on the trade-union movement, and what is its particular relevance to the professional engineer?"
"It is possible to minimise exhaust pollution from automobiles by precise control of the fuel input to the engine. One way of achieving such control is by using a digital memory system using metal-oxide-semiconductor (m.o.s.) integrated circuits."
      "There is no doubt that television is now the most widely used source of entertainment and information in Britain and throughout the greater part of the world. A system recently developed by the BBC is planned to make even better use of the domestic receiver by enabling pages of up-to-date information to be displayed on the screen at the touch of a switch. A practical experiment is being carried out this summer with potential users of the system."
"Over 150 companies from all over the world were represented at the Microwave '73 Exhibition held at Brighton from the 19th to the 21st of June. In addition, 75 technical papers were read to some 650 delegates. The main themes were microwave operational hardware and microwave systems."

The colloid thruster, which gets its thrust from the electrostatic acceleration of charged liquid droplets, is potentially a very attractive propulsion system, and space tests on this type of propulsion unit could be carried out in the near future."
  "Owing to the tedious calculations involved in analysing a large circuit a student rarely progresses beyond a 3-loop network, but effective use of the computer has been prevented by the tedium of computer programming. Now, however, a new language eases calculation to an extent whereby the student is helped to gain greater insight into circuit behaviour."
"The heavy losses suffered by Poland's electricity industry during the Second World War have long since been made good. To remain viable, further expansion, within the limits of Poland's natural resources, is necessary."
                                               "Prevention is better than cure, and there are so many potential trouble spots on large rotating machines that a systematically planned overhaul and repair programme is essential."
"The replacement of overhead lines by underground cables is one of the most emotive topics of discussion in the field of electrical power engineering. One thing is clear: it is very much more expensive - perhaps by up to 20 times - to install major supergrid transmission circuits underground than overhead on towers. Even so. this extra cost represents only part of the difficulty, since such circuits can impose severe technical problems on the design of the transmission system and also restrictions on the way in which it may subsequently be operated."
"Many stamp collectors are taking a new approach to the world's most popular collecting hobby: thematic collecting. For anyone interested in electronics, the enormous gallery of stamps related to the industry can be an interesting and challenging topic."

Future machines could have ratings up to 2000 MW with the use of slotless generators or superconducting rotors."
                     "The management of a successful R&D programme is a complex business, with inevitable differences of opinion on how problems should be tackled. Despite the vast increases over the years in resources and manpower devoted to R&D, it has become clear that individuals, and small, correctly motivated groups, can make contributions to R&D efforts out of all proportion to the numbers involved."
"Recent experiments have shown that it is possible to send good-quality facsimile transmissions of, for example, police information over high-frequency radio links, which may be the only means of communication available in sparsely populated areas."

"Theory can show that electromagnetic machines become better as they get larger, whereas the opposite is true for purely magnetic machines. What implications does this work have for high-speed transport systems?"
                  "The concept of the radio aerial evolved empirically from the experiments of a varied group of inventors - in particular Loomis, Dolbear, Tesla, Marconi and Jackson - with Marconi acting as the catalyst that combined their efforts into a practicable system."
    "If certain proposals now being put to the Law Commissions are accepted, engineers could find themselves taking a much more significant part in legal proceedings arising out of contract disputes. The fact that there have been very few disputes over contracts in the British electrical industry means that legal precedents are scarce, a fact which can lead to confusion over the interpretation of some clauses in the lEE/IMechE Model Forms."
"Unlike engineering, computer programming has no well-established methods of attack. Even when it has, these methods are disregarded too often. How can an engineer's approach be made to computer programming?"

Now, 25 years after their early remarkable experiments, the author looks back to those exciting days at Bell Telephone Laboratories."
  "From the invention of the transistor 25 years ago, the whole vast semiconductor industry of today has grown, and it is in the area of microelectronics that the most sensational advances have occurred. This article charts a path through the jungle of modern microelectronics terminology, and indicates where some of the latest techniques will find application."
                                                     "If the power supply to a hospital operating theatre fails, the consequences can be fatal.

            "At present, engineers with potentially lucrative ideas find it difficult to get acceptance for their proposals in large companies. The author's proposed `centres of enterprise' could help inventors to promote these ideas through forming their own companies"
   "It has been suggested that the first introduction that many people had to the idea of the laser was in a well publicised sequence from a James Bond film in the early 1960s. The effects of a powerful laser have also been compared with the `death ray' in H. G. Well's book `The War of the Worlds'. However, a laser is not the science fiction fan's ultimate weapon of destruction, but rather a sophisticated item of scientific equipment with an ever-growing range of applications."

  "Sometimes executives have to undertake rescue operations, both technical and personal. They need patience against pessimists and a sophisticated approach to administrative detail. They also need a bold approach; no one has all the luck but some exploit their share of it far better than others. These are known as `management skills'"
"A shortage of most heavy metals in the long-term future means that aluminium must now be fully exploited and no longer regarded as a substitute for copper but as a conductor in its own right"

One correspondent put forward the view that ambisonic reproduction had decided advantages over quadraphonic reproduction. In this article, Prof. Fellgett expands his views."
"Advanced, and not-so-advanced, engineering techniques may help to lead us either into an affluent, but dehumanised, society, or into an alternative creative society in which the quality of life is set as a more important objective than an ever-expanding consumption of goods. In this article, the author gives some pointers to where the critical decisions will have to be taken."
  "The telecommunication industry is one of the major growth industries in Britain, and substantial investments have been made in new methods and equipment in recent years. One reason for the expansion is increased reliability and reduced cost of capital equipment brought about by the rapid advance of solid-state techniques."

 "Once an electrical system has been installed it tends to be taken for granted and forgotten. Yet a good electrical installation is vital to the smooth running of the home, office and industry. The electrical contractor of the 1970s ensures a proper installation and is the link between the user and the provision of adequate electrical services."
"The ocean is a hostile environment to both man and his equipment. Recent developments in submersibles and new diving techniques have enabled man to venture further into the deep ocean, but there are still engineering problems to be solved."
"The human brain is a complex organ containing 1011 cells or neurons. It has been the subject of philosophers throughout the centuries, and even modern science has a very imperfect view of its functioning. But engineers, at least, can contribute to its understanding as an information-processing machine, and help with the concept of the `mind'"
   "Data communication is a vital part of any industrialised society, and much effort goes into optimising the use of the available resources. One way is to let the customer lease only the transmission channel and provide his own switching. A development of packet switching is discussed in this article."
     "With the world's limited supplies ot fuel and ever increasing fuel costs, there is logic in considering combined heat and power generation. Industry is already installing total-energy schemes because ot economic savings, and it is also in the interests ot the public supply authority to make use ot the waste heat in both thermal and nuclear power stations in order to improve their thermal efficiency. District heating is one way of doing this."
    "Digital techniques are being used increasingly in modern control and instrumentation methods, but the question of direct digital control for power applications is still a cause for controversy. This case study illustrates some of the problems that can arise."

    "The reliability and the availability characteristics of a 2-unit cold standby system with a single repair facility are analyzed under the assumption that the failure and the repair times are both generally distributed. System breakdown occurs when the operating unit fails while the other unit is undergoing repair. The system is characterized by the probability of being up or down. Integral equations corresponding to different initial conditions are set up by identifying suitable regenerative stochastic processes. The probability of the first passage to the down-state starting from specified initial conditions is obtained by the same method. An explicit expression for a Laplace Transform of the probability density function (pdf) of the downtime during an arbitrary time interval is obtained when the repair time is exponentially distributed. A general method is suggested for the calculation of the moments of the downtime when the repair time is arbitrarily distributed."
"The reliability literature offers an abundance of methods for the optimal design of systems under some constraints. In most of the papers, the problem considered is: given reliabilities of each constituent component and their constraint-type data, optimize the system reliability. This amounts to the assignment of optimal redundancies to each stage of the system, with each component reliability specified. This is a partial optimization of the system reliability. At the design stage, a designer has many options, e.g., component reliability improvement and use of redundancy. A true optimal system design explores these alternatives explicitly. Our paper demonstrates the feasibility of arriving at an optimal system design using the latter concept. For simplicity, only a cost constraint is used, however, the approach is more general and can be extended to any number of constraints. A particular cost-reliability curve is used to illustrate the approach."
"A Lagrange multiplier technique is used to obtain linear, minimum-variance, unbiased estimators for the scale parameters of the first asymptotic distributions of smallest and largest values with known mode. Coefficients for multiplying ordered observations are computed for complete and censored samples of size n = 1(1) 15. Each sample of size n is censored from above and all m-order-statistic estimators are obtained where m ⩽ n. Then the smallest subset of # order statistics from the set of m available order statistics is found which yields a 99% efficiency relative to the m-order-statistic estimator. The Cramér-Rao lower bound for the variances of the estimators for complete samples is derived and tabled for n = 1(1) 15. For censored samples the asymptotic variances of the maximum-likelihood m-order-statistic estimators are presented for comparative purposes."
"Burn-in programs are often used for automotive or airplane engines in order to eliminate early failures due to ineffective adjustments and similar repairable sources of failure. We assume that there are two operating states: Good and Poor. Each has its own reliability characteristic, and neither necessarily has any statistical property that improves with bum-in. The purpose of the bum-in program is to uncover the Poor engines and then to repair them to the Good state. We calculate the mean time to failure of such engines when a burn-in program is used and derive conditions under which a burn-in program is justified."
"This paper considers a 1-unit system; the unit is repaired upon failure. The failure and repair rates need not be constant. The system fails if the unit is not repaired within a fixed time, or if the number of failures during the mission exceeds a fixed number. As a special case, that number is allowed to be ``infinite.'' The Laplace transforms of the reliability and mean time to system failure are derived; they are not easily solved. The special case of constant failure and repair rates is treated. The results are compared with those of Calabro."
"A definition of availability having a probabilistic guarantee for a finite interval is made. Examples and asymptotic solution are presented."
"Some particular methods must be used in the investigation and insurance of the reliability of the complex small-production systems; like in the heavy-current electrical industry of Romania, which is more and more diversified. Theoretically, the scarcity of data leads to erroneous predictions of wearout, or to very large confidence intervals. Therefore, the use of statistical techniques in these situations is limited. The author presents his experience in utilizing both the physics of failure approach (analytical method); and the laboratory/field tests (experimental method), on both the systems and parts. Models of appropriate inquiry-sheets for the analysis of electric machines running performances, used by the author are presented; and some Romanian equipment is exemplified. The original organization of the reliability activity in a modern Romanian electric plant is graphically illustrated."
"Nine complex systems are described in this note, and formulae for the existing number of paths and system success are quoted for each system. A table of comparisons is included for various values of component reliability, which is assumed identical for each subsystem within a given structure."
"Consider two populations, each of whose probability properties are described by the 2-parameter exponential probability density function. The two parameters are unknown in each case. Assuming that a random sample is available from each of the two populations, this paper shows how to calculate an approximation for the probability that one of the populations has a greater reliability than the other. The Bayesian theory of statistical inference is used and we assume a weak prior for the parameters involved."

   "The reliability of the 2-level aluminum/silicon dioxide/aluminum system has been investigated. Test structures were fabricated using two types of aluminum films, deposited on unheated substrates (Al-I) and on 200°C substrates (Al-II). Two types of insulation layers were used: SiO2 from oxidation of silane, and rf sputtered SiO2 with an overlay of silane SiO2. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the topography of the crossovers and via-holes. More hillocks were seen with Al-I films than with Al-II films. Via-hole resistance and the incidence of intralevel opens and interlevel shorts were determined. A comparative evaluation of the four structures indicated that Al-II films are more desirable for first-level metallization. The test structures with Al-II films, subjected to 150°C storage for 1000 hours, exhibited no increase in the interlevel resistance and a failure rate of one interlevel short per 12000 crossovers, each 0.5 mil (13 μm) square. Temperature cycling of these structures from -65°C to 150°C for 500 cycles developed no interlevel shorts and resulted in a decrease of the interlevel resistance. These observations show a failure rate of less than one interlevel short per 13200 crossovers in 500 cycles. Process problems related to the reliability of 2-level structures are discussed."
"The measured rectangular dc pulse burnout energies are presented for 240 diodes representing 18 types of point contact mixer diodes commonly found in radar mixers. These measurements are compared to previously measured burnout energies on a few mixer diodes and to predictions of burnout energies using two burnout models found in the literature. The measured burnout energies tended to exhibit a lognormal distribution with pulse width. Further, it is shown that little or no variation in burnout energy occurs as a function of the manufacturer's quoted noise figure. Finally, a comparison between the measured dc pulse burnout energies and available rf pulse burnout energies indicates that the rf data follow the same trend in burnout energy versus pulse width as the dc data."
"This paper discusses the problem of determining which of a large set of possible but improbable malfunctions gave rise to a given set of measurements. The classes of systems under consideration generally lead to underdetermined sets of equations. Three methods of formulating and solving this class of problems are presented: 1) the pseudoinverse method: this leads to an easily-solved computational problem but it is not physically realistic and it tends to give poor results; 2) a pattern recognition approach based on a more realistic problem formulation: unfortunately, the computational problems associated with this formulation may be formoidable; and 3) a quadratic programming approack: this is based on minimization of a physically realistic objective function. A bmaosdification to eliminate discontinuities in the objetive function and a quasilinearization transform the original problem to an inequality-constrained quadratic minimization problem, which is readily solved by Lemke's complementary pivoting method. A sequence of successive quasilinearizations and estimations is defilned which is proved to converge to a minimum of the original objective function. In tests this convergence occurred very fast. Examples are given; very general classes of problems are discussed which can be handled in this way."
"The robustness of reliability predictions based on the exponential failure law is investigated under possible deviations within the Weibull family of failure distributions. Regions of robustness are provided for series systems of N identical components, N = 1(1)15; i.e., regions in the space of the Weibull shape parameter, within which one may safely use the exponential prediction procedure and have no more than a prespecified error."
"A change in attitude amongst purchasers of product in the United States has taken place. The paper describes the reasons and the historical development, and outlines the legal reasons for part of this change and the changes in philosophy of the administration as well as the judiciary. After considering this history, the paper describes some of the things the Quality Control specialist can do with the tools he has available for improving product quality throughout the spectrum of commerce of the United States. The entire paper is directed toward the engineers and managers in Quality Control and Reliability; it tells them how to use the tools they have already for the social aspects of the country's economy."
"A mathematical model is established for the reliability of modularly redundant systems with repair. The model allows different hazard rates for active units and for standby units. The hazard rates are assumed to be constant. The cases of constant repair rate and constant repair time for a two unit system are evaluated using the reliability and mean time between failure. The approach is then extended to systems with more than two units. A system parameter, relating to certain types of sensing, switching, and/or recovery has a very significant impact on system reliability for modularly redundant systems with repair."
"The member of the class of best linear unbiased estimators (BLUEs) of a parameter based on k order statistics which has minimum variance is called the k-optimum BLUE. The ranks, coefficients, variance, and efficiency are given for the k-optimum BLUE of the parameter of the Rayleigh distribution for k = 2(1)4 and a sample size of N = 2(1)22. In addition, an approximate k-optimum BLUE is given for k = 2(1)4 and N ⩾ 23."
"This paper provides management with an overview of product reliability and related areas. Charts are provided which show the expected relation of part count to laboratory test results and the expected relation of laboratory test results to operational performance. These charts are followed by laboratory and operational material used in the development of the overview charts."
"The time to failure of an m out of n component system, with component failure times exponentially and identically distributed, is treated. This failure time is shown to be identically distributed to the failure time of an n - m + 1 component standby system, with component failure times exponentially but not identically distributed. The proof of this result is based on a recursion formula for the distribution of time to system failure."
"This evolutionary hazard rate begins at zero and rises asymptotically to a constant value. Some of the consequences of this hazard rate are deduced."
"This paper aims to obtain the optimum cost allocation to a number of components connected in series (no redundancy) with a view to maximize the system reliability subject to a given total cost of the system. The reliability of each component is a function of its cost. The technique of Dynamic Programming has been employed to achieve the results."

     "Similarities and differences among 22 methods of quantitatively predicting operator and technician performance are described. Emphasis has been given to eight methods most fully developed and most likely to be used by system engineers. Two general techniques are employed: analysis of historical data and computer-simulation of behavioral processes. No general purpose methodology is available; each method deals with some types of tasks and systems more efficiently than others. In general, simulation-based methods are more powerful than nonsimulation methods. Most methods output probability estimates of successful task/system performance and completion time, but are relatively insensitive to equipment design parameters, manpower selection and training needs. With only one exception no operability method utilizes a formal data base as input and in most cases the parameters these input data describe are not specifically indicated. For most methods validation and/or system application data are either lacking or incomplete."
"Application of reliability engineering to process plant design, operation and control has led to a demand for estimates of `human reliability,' or `human error.' However, it is desirable to treat the concept of `human error' with caution and to avoid an approach in which the operator appears to be held solely responsible or even blamed; in reality the error arises out of a quite specific combination of conditions in the man-machine system and it is on the total system that attention should be centered. Problems such as performance of discrete tasks and vigilance tasks or behavior in emergencies have been widely studied. While some of this work appears applicable to process control, there remain significant gaps. A more comprehensive taxonomy of process operator error seems to be needed. Systems exist for reporting incidents in process plants, each with a particular objective such as improvement of personal safety, estimation of insurance rates, or reduction of maintenance costs. Data produced are specialized and often useless for other purposes. In particular, it is difficult to abstract data on malfunction involving the operator. A taxonomy suitable for process control is suggested and a scheme for collection of data on reliability in process plants is outlined. Attention is drawn to the relevance of the process and control system characteristics and to their variability. The importance of the process computer is emphasized, both in its impact on the control system and as a research tool."
"The effect of single or multiple faults on performance of operators operating in a realistic maintenance situation was investigated. The task was fault location in the display portion of a sonar system. Analysis of repair times shows that multiple task performance can be considered as a simple combination of single task performance regardless of the number of operators. Multiple operator performance is not exactly a simple combination of single operator performance, but the assumption is reasonable for model development."
"This paper briefly examines traditional approaches to human reliability and presents a technique which permits the system designer to derive a mutually exclusive and exhaustive set of operator error categories in a man-computer system. These error categories are defined in terms of process failures and provide the system designer with a qualitative index suitable for determining error causes and consequences. The technique is demonstrated, and the utility of the resulting error categories is evaluated in the context of two studies on a military information processing system. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of detectable and non-detectable errors and a suggestion for determining the impact of errors on ultimate system goals."
"The study of human reliability has traditionally taken an ``error-rate'' approach, with the emphasis on identifying and reporting supposedly consistent and basic error-rate levels for various manual activities. This paper approaches the study of human reliability by identifying numerous factors that tend to increase the probability that errors will occur in computer-based business information systems. The major causal factor categories are personal, design, documentation, training, source data, man-machine interface, and environment. This causal factor approach suggests that most human-generated errors can be prevented by eliminating the factors that cause errors to occur."
"The Kalman Filter technique is applied to the problem of predicting human operator performance in the execution of a wide variety of tasks described by an exponential improvement model. Reliable predictions can be used as a guide by management on the efficiency of task design, operator selection, and operator training functions. Results of industrial case studies involving mechanical and electrical assemblies show that realistic predictions can be made even when the model parameters are nonstationary. Steady-state detection is also included in the paper to permit the isolation of the ``improvement plateau'' phenomenon which indicates a false performance ceiling. In such instances both the initial improvement phase and the recovery phase are described by exponential models."
"A model for the human controller in continuous manual control tasks is described. The model is based on modern control and human response theories. Techniques for predicting closed-loop system performance and relative workload for the task are presented. The implications for reliability assessment in corresponding man-machine problems are discussed. Finally, an example that involves prediction of pilot performance and workload, and their relation to mission success, for a STOL landing-approach is given."
"Human components in manned systems often compensate for hardware error by utilizing other information and past experience in addition to the normal hardware output. However, errors in human information processing and utilization, cognitive reliability, often lowers the overall system reliability. Cognitive reliability in manned systems is discussed in terms of the types of human errors which may occur and in terms of factors which affect the occurrence of these errors. It is a complex function of attitudinal and structural factors and their interaction. Cognitive reliability is useful for examining man's role in complex systems where cognitive as well as perceptual-motor skills are required."
"This paper presents a formal analysis of the problem of determining the inferential impact of the information in a composite report from a collection of unreliable observers or sensors. Each sensor reports one of a finite number of possible states of a data system linked probabilistically with an ``objective system'' whose condition is to be inferred from the data state. The principal assumptions are that the sensors do not ``collaborate'' in making their reports and that their reports are conditioned only by the existing data state and not by the actual, unobservable state of the objective system. Use of the notion of conditional independence to express these assumptions gives the analytic expressions a tractable form which sheds light on various inference issues. The paper also briefly discusses current empirical research on the question of how well people actually adjust the impact of inferential evidence to correspond to the unreliability of the sources of information."
"A normative 2-stage model for incorporating reliability measurements of data-reporting sources in a Bayesian inference system is presented. An experiment required human subjects to make intuitive inferences about two hypotheses on the basis of sample data which were reported with a given reliability. When compared with the optimal model, subjects exhibited systematic errors in estimating the diagnostic impact of less than perfectly reliable data. Their responses reflected the use of specific nonoptimal heuristic strategies to process the information. A utility function was added to the normative model to illustrate how a best choice might be made from among potential data-gathering experiments whose costs increase with their reliabilities. Recommendations for using computer aids to enhance efficiency in inference systems are made"

   "This paper presents an integrated approach to the design of an ultrareliable memory system using a variety of coding and modularization techniques on each of the memory subsystem elements. The overall objective is to provide a properly operating memory system in spite of any single indigenous fault (regardless of the number of failures which might ensue). In other words, the system has the capability automatically to: (1) detect single faults and multiple failures, (2) mask failures to prevent malfunctions, without interrupting service, (3) isolate the fault to a replaceable module, and (4) reconfigure the faulty unit out of the system. The storage medium and retrieval circuits are checked and corrected by coding techniques. Some redundancy is used on the subunits, but the total redundancy is less than 20% of the system cost, and diagnostic software is eliminated."
"Equations are derived which enable one to calculate the system reliability for parallel or triple modular redundant systems with standby spares. Software error detection is introduced into the TMR/Spares system configuration in order to utilize fully all of the units. An indication of the sensitivity of the system reliability to an increase in the number of spares, partitioning, switching, variations in the powered and unpowered failures rates, and time is presented. A comparison of the parallel and the TMR/Spares system configurations, under similar conditions, is given."
"This paper attempts to provide a methodology for selecting the product to which to apply Value Engineering (VE). It briefly summarizes existing VE methodology and points up the deficiencies. The technique is a sensitivity analysis of diagrams of networks which indicate the cost interdependencies of the product. By determining the areas with the highest cost reduction potential, VE efforts can be concentrated on these. Thus, VE can be made more cost-effective."
"A competing risk model is developed for an individual who is subject to two risks of death or failure. One risk is the failure of a single organ which has a constant hazard rate. The other risk is the failure of a two organ system in which one of the two organs must survive in order that the system not fail. Each organ in this two organ system has a constant hazard rate, and the hazard rate increases when only one organ is working. The two risks are assumed to operate independently. Maximum likelihood estimating equations are developed along with the formulas for the large sample variance-covariance matrix of the requisite parameters."
"The best linear unbiased estimator of the parameter of the Rayleigh distribution using order statistics in a Type II censored sample from a potential sample of size N is considered. The coefficients for this estimator are tabled to five decimal places for N = 2(1)15 and censoring values of r1, (the number of observations censored from the left) and r2 (the number of observations censored from the right) such that r1 + r2 ⩽ N - 2 for N = 2(1)10, r1 + r2 ⩽ N - 3 for N = 11(1)15."
"This paper presents a new method for the optimization of system reliability with linear constraints, using the parametric approach [1]. The classical nonlinear programming technique is used for the solution. This method, which is analytically complete, sufficiently accurate and computationally simple, gives optimum or near optimum design. The procedure is illustrated with examples, and flow charts for the problems are given."
 "This paper shows how Product Liability common law has developed over the decades. The kinds of defects with which one must deal are classified into manufacturing, design, marketing, and puffing. They are analyzed with respect to their product liability implications. No-fault enterprise liability is described and analyzed."
"Fault product-liability is the cornerstone of a responsible industry. It provides the moral and economic justification for safe products. No-fault product liability rewards the just and unjust alike, and provides no direct incentive for a manufacturer to make the safest product he can."
"Though common law declares the safety of the people as the supreme law and guarantees to every individual the right of personal safety, courts cannot protect individuals from product-caused injuries because of inherent shortcomings of the judicial process. Scientific and technological changes take place on a predetermined time scale but ethics and human values do not develop in the same manner. The adversary system of adjudication of private disputes cannot promote a contextual approach to technology assessment whereby goal-oriented policy can be made by courts."
"The following 4 propositions are discussed. 1) Since every action by a producer relevant to whether the use of his product is attended by injuries has some cost and benefit consequences, a producer has numerous safety-related options available to him. 2) The degree of safety in the use of a product is an element of product quality. 3) If one focuses on the causes for some inevitable product safety costs, one may be able to anticipate and reduce the total public costs as well as private costs. 4) Liability for products is a kind of insurance device."

   "Eleven sets of test plans are given for testing ``λ = λ0'' against the alternative ``λ = λ1 < λ0'' and ``λ = λ2 > λ0'' where λ is the failure rate. The results are useful for incentive plans and life-cycle costing applications, and are fundamental in the life testing of equipment, whether a consumer or industrial item, during the constant failure-rate period. The theory and equations for the calculations of the tables and plans are developed and discussed and the related references are included."
"A reliability model is proposed and evaluated for a fault tolerant computer system which consists of multiple classes of modules and allows for degraded modes of performance. Each module of a given class has both an active and a passive hazard rate; constant hazard rates are assumed for active and dormant failures, and the given class may operate either in N Modular Redundancy (NMR: n + 1 out of 2n + 1 = N) or as a standby sparing system. The model allows for mission-phase changes at deterministic time points when the numbers of modules per class can be changed. The analysis proceeds by generalizing the notions of standby and NMR redundancy, which for N = 3 is TMR (Triple Modular Redundancy), into a concept called hybrid-degraded redundancy. The probabilistic evaluation of the unified redundancy concept is then developed to yield, for a given modular class, the joint distribution of success and the number of nonfailed modules from that class, at special times. With this information, a Markov chain analysis gives the reliability of an entire sequence of phases (mission profile)."
"It is important in many reliability applications to determine the probability that the failure time of an element from one population will exceed that of an element from a second population. In this paper, we present a method for computer calculations of Pr {x ⩾ y} where X and Y are each from a three-parameter Weibull distribution. In addition, we provide the moments and the probability density function of the difference. Numerical examples are included."
"A Student's test of Ho:σ = σo against σ ≠ σo of the scale parameter σ of the Normal, logistic, and Cauchys distributions, when the location parameter μ is known is based on a few sample percentiles selected from a large sample. Tables facilitating the computation of the test statistic are provided. The significance level and power of the test statistic for sample sizes ⩽ 200 are simulated by the Monte Carlo method and compared with the significance level and power when it is assumed to have its asymptotic distribution."
"A fuel charge/discharge system for a nuclear reactor with on-load fuel changing is considered. The system consists of two fuel charging (fc) machines which operate in parallel. When both fc machines have been down for more than 28 days the reactor becomes subcritical and shuts down spontaneously. Using conditional probability arguments and renewal theory it is shown how reliability measures of a two unit redundant system can be extended to obtain the expected frequency and duration of reactor shut-downs due to fc system failures."
"A smooth empirical Bayes estimator is derived for the intensity parameter (hazard rate) in the Poisson distribution as used in life testing. The reliability function is also estimated either by using the empirical Bayes estimate of the parameter, or by obtaining the expectation of the reliability function. The behavior of the empirical Bayes procedure is studied through Monte Carlo simulation in which estimates of mean-squared errors of the empirical Bayes estimators are compared with those of conventional estimators such as minimum variance unbiased or maximum likelihood. Results indicate a significant reduction in mean-squared error of the empirical Bayes estimators over the conventional variety."
"The location, shape, and scale parameters of the Weibull distribution are estimated from Type I progressively censored samples by the method of maximum likelihood. Nonlinear logarithmic likelihood estimating equations are derived, and the approximate asymptotic variance-covariance matrix for the maximum likelihood parameter estimates is given. The iterative procedure to solve the likelihood equations is a stable and rapidly convergent constrained modified quasilinearization algorithm which is applicable to the general case in which all three parameters are unknown. The numerical results indicate that, in terms of the number of iterations required for convergence and in the accuracy of the solution, the proposed algorithm is a very effective technique for solving systems of logarithmic likelihood equations for which all iterative approximations to the solution vector must satisfy certain intrinsic constraints on the parameters. A FORTRAN IV program implementing the maximum likelihood estimation procedure is included."
"Formulas are derived for the mean value and the variance of the distribution of time to system failure for parallel redundant and m out of n systems. A novel approach is used in the derivation which requires only elementary calculus and no explicit integration of specific functions. For the general case component failure times are assumed to be statistically independent and exponentially distributed. In addition, a special case of statistical dependence is treated."
"A conditional transform approach is applied to the two-unit standby redundant system with instantaneous switchover, and with failure and repair times that follow general well-behaved distributions for each unit. Transforms of distributions are obtained for T, the time to system failure, the number of repairs completed during T, the time spent on repair during T, and the idle time of the repairman during T. Applicable numerical methods are also discussed."
"Necessary and sufficient conditions for a function to be a mean residual lifetime function of a random variable with finite mean are given."

  "The advent of high-powered lasers has created quite a stir among nuclear physicists, who are enthusiastically examining the prospects of using these devices in a new approach to the problem of creating ultrahigh-temperature plasmas to maintain and control thermonuclear fusion. The idea of building ``modern internal combustion engines'' (ICE) based on this form of clean, efficient, and powerful energy was examined by Edward Teller at the 7th International Quantum Electronics Conference, Montreal, Canada, during May 8-11, 1972, where he deliberated upon the overwhelming engineering problems to be solved before such an engine could be realized. Dr. Teller's exciting commentary would have been lost had it not been for the attendance of Spectrum staff writer Marce Eleccion and the kind assistance of James R. Packard of the 3M Co., who tape-recorded Dr. Teller's remarks. Subsequently, Dr. Teller and Mr. Eleccion edited the tapes to produce this article. At the conference itself, the famed thermonuclear expert's unique sense of humor was exhibited when the session chairman (in his introductory remarks) confessed to the audience that he did not really know the content of the upcoming presentation, to which Dr. Teller replied: ``I might perhaps start by saying that I don't know either what I am going to tell you, and for that reason, I will listen very carefully and recommend the same to you.''"

"Introductory principles of program performance in virtual storage have been presented to give a perspective of the virtual environment for systems designers and programmers. It is recognized that the list of guidelines presented is not comprehensive as many more useful techniques will be developed as experience is gained with virtual storage systems. It is hoped that these program design considerations and the programming guidelines will assist these users in their future virtual storage program development."
"Decision tree analysis is a formal methodology by which complex decision problems can be decomposed into sequences of contemplated decisions (or acts) and their uncertain consequences (or events). The analysis is naturally and conveniently depicted in the form of a tree, where the branches emanating from a given node represent alternative acts or events. Anticipated cash flows and probabilities are associated with appropriate branches of the tree, and an optimal strategy may be defined as that path that maximizes expected monetary gain. The concept of risk aversion may be introduced by means of a preference function, which quantitatively represents the decision-maker's attitudes toward risks. These ideas will be explored in greater depth and clarified by example in ensuing sections."
"Programmers are quite accustomed to describing data they use: where to find it, what devices are involved, the layout of the data, what to do with it after the job is complete, processing techniques employed, and often a great deal more. The reason data is so described is that, nowadays, programs call upon a great many other programs for assistance. All sorts of common-place functions that the programmer takes for granted are provided by other, already-written programs, that are invoked explicitly or implicitly by what the programmer himself writes. Thus programmers must describe things about their data to be able to use the functions provided."
"We have presented a number of considerations that are pertinent to the degree of centralization or dispersion of computing facilities within an organization. We have argued that costs can be associated with the major factors involved so that effects of proposed changes in dispersion can be assessed quantitatively, if only approximately."
"Developers of computer systems are frequently faced with a choice among several possible implementations of a given function. Similary, the operator of a computer system faces a choice in setting adjustable parameters built into the system. In each case, the alternative that optimizes system performance is sought. While analytic or simulation models may sometimes assist in making the choice, it is true that in most cases only actual running tests of the various alternatives can provide definitive answers. But even when all the variations can be tested on a real system, it is not easy to obtain meaningful results. One has the choice between performing the tests on a carefully controlled benchmark job stream, or on the system in an actual uncontrolled working environment. In the first case, the results may be inapplicable except to the specific benchmarks chosen, and a realistic benchmark stream is often hard to come by (this is particularly true for time-sharing or real-time computer systems). In the second case, random fluctuations in the magnitude and nature of the load placed on the system make it difficult to compare the results obtained under different system versions. Consequently, although performance evaluation is still possible, data must be gathered over a fairly long period of time. For instance, different versions of the CP-67 time-sharing system1,2 were compared by Bard3 under actual operating conditions. However, several months' worth of data were required. To meet the objectives outlined above, results must be forthcoming at a faster pace."
"The Checkout Compiler was developed to work in harness with the Optimizing Compiler to provide an exceptional level of support for the PL/I language. The Checkout Compiler was designed particularly to increase the productivity of programmers in their development of programs. In meeting this objective, certain constraints had to be taken into consideration, chief of these being compatibility with the Optimizing Compiler. Some design choices were made for performance reasons."
  "Data is a resource in both its physical and descriptive aspects. Both should be managed as any other major organizational resource—that is, data needs to be available on an organizationwide basis and thus requires centralized control. Described in this paper is a Data Dictionary/Directory (DDID) which provides such a method of centralized control over data management."
"A significant amount of work has been done in the area of general indexing in terms of simple indexing. This is reflected in the development of access methods such as VSAM. Very little work has been done on complex indexes. The only example given in this paper is the cascading indexes of CICS. Future work could include an expansion of the items discussed under complex indexes. In particular, some attention should be given to the relationships between different sets of data. A limited set of these relationships are provided by hierarchical data structures provided by systems such as the Information Managment System."
"The operating system started as a means for controlling the sequential use of a computer more efficiently than a machine operator could do himself. As computers have grown larger, faster, and more able to support independent concurrent operations, operating systems have grown to provide for the simultaneous shared use of such systems. Thus multiprogramming, originally developed to make still more efficient use of the hardware, has become essential in its own right with the development of interactive computing."
"In designing a system like OS/VS2-2, which is aimed at meeting a broad variety of objectives in a multitude of complex operational environments, the tradeoffs and decisions are extremely difficult to decide. The intent of this paper has been to give insight into the thinking behind the major new elements of the OS/VS2-2 design."
"DOS/VS represents a significant set of enhancements to the Disk Operating System. The addition of virtual storage support, additional partitions, and the relocating loader, among other items, extends the ability of the user to perform multiprogramming operations on System/370. Demands on the system operator are reduced, as are those on the scheduling function at the user installation. This type of operation, however, may require some changes in thinking by many DOS users, especially in considering factors that affect the total productivity of an entire computer installation."
     "Conventional approaches to Material Requirements Planning (MRP) entail an inherent massive data-handling task. Consequently, batch-oriented MRP systems tend to be untimely in their response to change since replanning can be done only periodically—at best, probably once a week. A method of continuous replanning that minimizes the number of accesses to inventory records and bills of material at any given time is presented in this paper. Called net change, this approach offers the user the ability to replan at high frequency, or continuously in a transaction-driven system. The COPICS manuals describe a system that is based on net change material requirements planning."
"The attention of the computer user community is increasingly focusing on data bases and computerized information systems because of two converging trends. Computerized information systems are coming to play an essential role in business operations, and the hardware and software technology for supporting information systems is in a period of rapid technical progress. In spite of this attention, there is still little common agreement as to what information systems are, the functions they perform, and — from a technical point of view -how they should be designed, implemented, installed, and used. These conditions arise naturally from the newness of the field and the ad hoc nature of existing Computerized implementations. A compounding factor is the wide variety of perspectives of those who discuss information systems — for example, the executive, the management consultant, the systems analyst, the mathematician, and the systems programmer. In this paper, we emphasize aspects of information systems that are of importance to systems analysts, systems designers, and implementors."
"In this section on information structure, we have defined an Entity Set Model and related its basic concepts to notions of classification, naming, and description of Entities. We have also indicated how the Entity Set Model can provide a basis for a database system with certain very desirable characteristics. In Part III, we move from the discussion of information structures and associations among names, to a discussion of models for representing the names in computer storage."
"Features that are properties of the String, Encoding, and Physical Device Model Levels have been discussed. An implementation of a very generalized data-accessing mechanism that could provide, among other things, many of the desired functions specified by the Data Base Task Group Report might be based on RDAL and these model levels without dealing with the questions of data independence and search path selection. DIAM does, however, provide an excellent basis for a generalized data independent system because of the stable Entity Set Model name structure and the wide variety of file organizations provided by the String Name Structure. The present catalog provides a good basis for the storage of the information needed to maintain data integrity and security. It also provides a good basis for the collection of statistics for performance enhancement."
"The primary intent of the protocol presented in this paper is to facilitate and control the transfer of data through a network of computers. Although the protocol effectively deals with this problem, it only begins to solve the problems of a resource-sharing and distributed-data capability that networks should provide. The problems of managing data on a single system are difficult, but a multisystem data-management capability is probably an order of magnitude more difficult."
   "The use of computers in financial planning has become an area of increasing interest to financial management and data processing users. Computing systems facilitate the use of financial models in that they allow for the storage and retrieval of a representation of a financial plan and also for the evaluation of the consequences of “what if” conditions. Thus a financial model is a tool that can assist in the entire business planning process whether it be forecasting, cash management, or projection of profits. This paper presents introductory concepts that provide a basis for systems design and implementation of financial models. Described are the terminology, the basic components of financial models, and two general approaches to the construction of these models."
"Business planning has become a major management concern within many corporate organizations since business planning systems now assist in the conduct and management of many corporate activities. Common to all planning groups is the rising cost of development, implementation, and maintenance of planning systems and, as a result, financial planning programs and techniques have been formulated to facilitate these areas. The tools presented in this paper may automate one or more tasks in the planning process, establish libraries of proved computational routines in the form of macroinstructions and subroutines, or provide assistance in a planning support area such as data management and report generation."
"Planning and planning data can be categorized, according to managerial objectives, as operational, tactical, and strategic. The use of a computer to process planning data can be aided by the use of a planning systems generator such as PSG II, a programmed discipline that allows the business and/or financial planner to specify a data bank and enter data values, to set up rules for additional data generation, and to format statistical or graphical reports containing planning data. The resulting system is a planning-data system that is ready to assist the subjective, decision-oriented environment of a company's planning unit."
"Users of smaller systems, such as an IBM System/3, can design and implement financial models using a method similar to the top-down approach used on larger systems. There are three approaches depending on the system configuration: card systems, FORTRAN and DASD systems, and non-FORTRAN and DASD systems. The financial modeling systems resulting from these methods utilize approaches (such as top-down) similar to those used on larger systems. Hence, future upward growth to larger systems is facilitated since these approaches may be employed."
"We have described our experimental approach to bank modeling, one intention of which is to permit bank management to estimate how well the policies they devise will stand up under the uncertainties that make the banking industry so dynamic. One need only look at government actions that affect the country's monetary policy to see the importance of possible but unexpected contingencies. We have modeled banking situations in a research environment. From a satisfactory demonstration in that context, we believe that our approach is worthy of further consideration by the banking industry."
"Computer-assisted forecasting techniques have been presented. Time-series extrapolation techniques are based upon the historical pattern of the item to be forecasted. Of particular importance are causal (functional) models which take influencing factors into consideration. Regardless whether the causal model comprises a single relation or multiple relations, one must be aware of the various tests and evaluating methods in the stages of model building in order to obtain better forecast models. Building and analyzing a forecasting model normally requires data manipulation and calculation. Unless these tasks are performed in a systematic manner, a heavy burden is placed on the model-builder. Productivity in forecasting activities is increased by using a systematic computer programming system oriented for forecasting. Introduced as an example forecasting program was FAMS. Further important steps forward are flexible linkage of techniques, linkage of models, and linkage of planning applications. By realizing these, forecasting will lay a foundation of management science applications and provide a framework for timely and sound decision making."
  "The design and operational features are described for a computer-assisted ellipsometer (called ETA for Ellipsometric Thickness Analyzer), developed to provide reliable, real-time measurement of field-effect transistor gate insulator thickness in a manufacturing environment. ETA illuminates the sample with light of fixed polarization and uses a rotating analyzer to measure the polarization of the reflected light. Sample alignment is done automatically by ETA, so that usually no operator adjustments are required. Fourier analysis of the light transmitted by the analyzer is used to reduce noise and enhance measurement precision. In its normal mode of operation (incident light linearly polarized at 45°), ETA can measure single and double-layer films of SiO2 and Si3N4 in the thickness range of 300 to 800 Å with precision comparable to that of conventional ellipsometers. Other modes of operation, which make use of a fixed-position compensator in the incident light path, allow precise measurement of thin films (0 to 300 Å) and permit use of ETA as a general-purpose ellipsometer. The typical time interval required for wafer alignment, data acquisition, analysis and recorded output of film thickness is about five seconds, and the measurement reproducibility is typically about 1 Å."
"An experimental x-y measurement system is described that was designed for the high-speed, high-precision measurements required in integrated circuit manufacturing and for optical measurement applications in which a sufficiently large data base is required for statistical process analysis. The technology for this experimental system differs considerably from that of conventional optical measuring systems in current use and utilizes a computer for data acquisition, manipulation and evaluation. The system, utilizing the edge detection principle, presently operates at a measuring speed of 2.5 cm/s. An analysis gives both the short-term and the long-term precision of the system. The standard deviation for the short-term precision is 0.038 µm."
"The usefulness of electrophotographic exposure sensitometry as a means of characterizing and evaluating new photoconductor materials has been extended by coupling the experiment to an on-line computer. This automated system provides several new functional capabilities not realistically attainable in manual operation and drastically reduces the time lag in the exchange of information between research workers who prepare materials and those who evaluate the materials. These various improvements have been achieved by extensive use of interactive graphic techniques and a user-oriented data-base organization."
"A new method is described that utilizes coherent bandpass spatial filtering and subsequent superposition to form filtered images in which small differences in size and geometry of the original object are readily detected. The theoretical basis is discussed and experiments described in which signal ratios of about 10:1 are obtained for a diameter change of 2.5 percent of a clear circular disc. The method is used to process in parallel a 57-mm evaporation mask containing 12,000 holes, each being 0.1 mm in diameter. The size of each hole is accurately gauged and small imperfections are indicated in the filtered image."
"Two optical methods were investigated for accurately measuring the gap, or chamber spacing, that separates two closely spaced transparent plates. The first method uses a special microscope in which the main feature is a unit-magnification catadioptric system that gives an aberration-free image of the chamber outside the plates, where it is accessible to a high-power objective. The second method is based upon the light section principle, whereby the image of a slit is projected onto the boundaries of the chamber and is thus doubled. The reflected images are observed with a microscope and the degree of separation, which is proportional to the chamber spacing, is measured. Accuracy better than 2 µm is obtained for the two techniques. The choice of the appropriate method depends on the surface quality of the chamber boundaries."
"The usual general-purpose computing automaton (e.g., a Turing machine) is logically irreversible—its transition function lacks a single-valued inverse. Here it is shown that such machines may be made logically reversible at every step, while retaining their simplicity and their ability to do general computations. This result is of great physical interest because it makes plausible the existence of thermodynamically reversible computers which could perform useful computations at useful speed while dissipating considerably less than kT of energy per logical step. In the first stage of its computation the logically reversible automaton parallels the corresponding irreversible automaton, except that it saves all intermediate results, thereby avoiding the irreversible operation of erasure. The second stage consists of printing out the desired output. The third stage then reversibly disposes of all the undesired intermediate results by retracing the steps of the first stage in backward order (a process which is only possible because the first stage has been carried out reversibly), thereby restoring the machine (except for the now-written output tape) to its original condition. The final machine configuration thus contains the desired output and a reconstructed copy of the input, but no other undesired data. The foregoing results are demonstrated explicitly using a type of three-tape Turing machine. The biosynthesis of messenger RNA is discussed as a physical example of reversible computation."
"The formulation of the closed queuing network model of a multiprogramming computer system is generalized to allow each task to have its own set of facility service rates and I/O device selection probability distribution. In the model, processor sharing is assumed for different types of customers. It is shown through a series of investigations that the model reasonably approximates pre-emptive priority dispatching."

     "Self-focusing and trapping of an intense, short light pulse is discussed on the basis of a parabolic scalar wave equation which includes a quadratic nonlinear refractive index. When the finite relaxation time of the nonlinear index is taken into account, the propagation properties of the transient solution differ considerably from those of the time-independent solution. Based mainly on the results of our numerical calculations, we show that contraction of the self-focusing pulse stops at a finite radius and that part of the pulse remains trapped beyond this focal point. The limiting radius decreases rather rapidly with increasing input power as well as with pulse width. However, if we assume a cutoff radius, the resulting filament accounts for experiments performed with multimode lasers. Effects of stimulated Raman scattering and dispersion are also discussed."
"In nonlinear electromagnetic media the various portions of a wave can travel with different velocities, which can result in the formation of electromagnetic shock waves. The structure of such a steady state shock is determined by an equilibrium between the velocity differences that tend to sharpen the shock and the sources of dispersion that cause a broadening of the shock. Several nonlinear transmission line models are examined for the nature and existence of a single-valued steady state shock. In all cases a nonlinear shunt capacitance is assumed. If the dispersion arises from the relaxation behavior caused by a resistance in series with the nonlinear capacitance, a steady shock always exists, its width decreasing as the extent of the nonlinearity generated by the shock increases. If the series resistance is itself shunted by another capacitance, the relaxation process is not manifested at very high frequencies. This system yields a critical condition for the existence of a continuous single-valued steady state wave profile. If the line has too little dispersion, the steady state profile is multivalued and therefore physically unrealizable.<p>These dispersion requirements are equivalent to the condition that the velocity of small, high frequency signals ahead of the shock must be greater than the velocity of the shock itself. It is believed that this condition is a broadly applicable criterion for the existence of a stable, single-valued, steady state wave profile. While this hypothesis is not proved analytically, it is supported here by plausibility arguments and by analysis of another system in which the dispersion is included in the linear series inductance rather than in the nonlinear shunt capacitance."
"A nonlinear eigenvalue problem is solved analytically to obtain the shock-like traveling waves of Fisher's nonlinear diffusion equation, with which he described the wave of advance of advantageous genes. A phase-plane analysis of the wave profiles shows that the propagation speed of the waves is linearly proportional to their thickness. The analytic solution is asymptotically accurate in the limit of infinitely large characteristic speeds. However, as they have a minimum threshold value which is not zero, the asymptotic solution turns out to be highly accurate for all propagation speeds. The wave profiles of Fisher's equation are shown to be identical to the steady state solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equation that are obtained when dissipative effects are dominant over dispersive effects."
"The technique of linearization is applied to quadratic semilinear systems of n first-order partial differential equations. By introducing a related linear algebra A, we combine analytic and algebraic arguments to obtain a class of linearizable systems. We relate the coefficients of such systems to the center of A and show that, for hyperbolic systems, the ideals of A decouple the system into disjoint subsystems each having its own single wave number."
"This paper discusses the development of APL, emphasizing and illustrating the principles underlying its design. The principle of simplicity appears most strongly in the minimization of rules governing the behavior of APL objects, while the principle of practicality is served by the design process itself, which relies heavily on experimentation. The paper gives the rationale for many specific design choices, including the necessary adjuncts for system management."
"This paper discusses “general arrays,” i.e., arrays in which the items are either scalars or other arrays. Functions are defined to construct, select from, restructure, and in general manipulate such arrays. Operators are presented as functions whose arguments or values are other functions that can be other than scalar functions. The exposition is shortened and simplified by presenting the material throughout in terms of APL."
"The problem of providing communication with APL programs was approached by formulating systems as collections of autonomous processors communicating on interfaces consisting of shared variables. This paper discusses the formulation of a theoretical APL system and cites experience with a prototype APL shared variable system which both uses and provides shared variable interfaces."

   "The notion of a functional relation among the attributes of a data set can be fruitfully applied in the structuring of an information system. These relations are meaningful both to the user of the system in his semantic understanding of the data, and to the designer in implementing the system. An important equivalence between operations with functional relations and operations with analogous Boolean functions is demonstrated in this paper. The equivalence is computationally helpful in exploring the properties of a given set of functional relations, as well as in the task of partitioning a data set into subfiles for efficient implementation."
"This paper describes a method for predicting the paging behavior of a program in a virtual memory multiprogramming environment. The effect of overall system activity on the program is summarized in one parameter, the page survival index. The model correlates well with observations taken on programs running under CP-67. The model can be used for paging load prediction, simulator input verification, and evaluation of program rearrangement and sharing."
"A methodology for computer performance evaluation based on the statistical characterization of response time is described. The results of its application to an information retrieval system are presented. The first part of the paper gives a general discussion of measurement techniques, data reduction procedures and the structure of the system being examined. A set of “system environment” parameters and a set of “job” parameters are then defined and appraised in terms of actual measurements collected over two different weekly periods. Various ways of using the statistical characterization for improving performance are then considered."
"In a multiprogramming, virtual-memory computing system, many processes compete for the main storage page frames and CPU's of the real system. It is customary to define a subset of these processes called the “multiprogramming set” (MPS), and to allocate resources only to those processes currently in the MPS. Each process remains in the MPS for a limited time and is then demoted. The system paging manager controls the size of the MPS; it allocates the available page frames among the processes in the MPS and fetches appropriate pages into the page frames."
"This paper deals with the problem of equalizing channels containing strong intersymbol interference. Typical of such channels are those of digital magnetic recording systems and data communication systems with partial-response signaling. First we discuss reasons that a conventional receiver with a linear equalizer cannot efficiently compensate for distortion in such channels. We then present a new receiver configuration in which the equalizer and quantizer are embedded in an inverse filter circuit that eliminates major intersymbol interference components. This configuration allows us to use a simple iteration algorithm to adaptively adjust the equalizer. Application of the scheme to digital magnetic recording data is discussed as an illustrative example."
"Let a k-partition of a graph be a division of the vertices into k disjoint subsets containing m1 ≥ m2, …, ≥ mk vertices. Let Ec be the number of edges whose two vertices belong to different subsets. Let λ1 ≥ λ2, …, ≥ λk be the k largest eigenvalues of a matrix, which is the sum of the adjacency matrix of the graph plus any diagonal matrix U such that the sum of all the elements of the sum matrix is zero. Then given equation. A theorem is given that shows the effect of the maximum degree of any node being limited, and it is also shown that the right-hand side is a concave function of U. Computational studies are made of the ratio of upper bound to lower bound for the two-partition of a number of random graphs having up to 100 nodes."
"Thin garnet films suitable for magnetic bubble devices can be made by depositing the film material onto nonmagnetic garnets such as Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG). The performance of these devices is influenced by the dislocation content of the films. This, in turn, depends on the dislocation content of the substrate. Dislocations in the substrate can be detected by means of the birefringence they induce, or from the etch pits formed where they meet the sample surface. Most of the dislocations revealed by these techniques have been climb loops around inclusions and helical dislocations. This paper describes an optical method for determining the sign of the stresses at inclusions and nature of loops and helical dislocations. The method has shown that iridium inclusions are compressed by the matrix and that the loops and helices in GGG are extrinsic; they grow either by the emission of vacancies or the absorption of interstitial atoms."
"An n-channel insulated-gate field-effect transistor technology established at IBM Research has served as the basis for further development leading to FET memory. Designs and characteristics of experimental devices of 500 and 1000 Å gate insulator thicknesses are presented, with particular attention to the effects of source-drain spacing."
"The development of a new device, called the space-charge-limited (SCL) transistor with transverse injection is reported in this paper. A theoretical model for space-charge-limited transistors, both npn and pnp, on high-resistivity silicon substrates is described and a quantitative analysis is given. Experimental results for SCL transistors are presented to support the model's validity. According to the model, current in SCL transistors is controlled by the base of a parallel-connected lateral transistor in two ways. First, the base of the parallel transistor controls the potential step in the high resistivity base of the SCL transistor. Second, the base of the parallel transistor injects carriers in the direction transverse to the SCL current flow. These carriers are of types opposite to those that carry the current flow in the SCL transistor and thus partly neutralize the space-charge in the current flow. The carriers propagate, predominantly by drift, across the high-resistivity base region of the SCL transistor. The resulting base transit time is about two orders of magnitude faster than that of a bipolar transistor with equal base width. No charge storage takes place in saturation. These features and the very low device capacitances make the SCL transistor attractive for low-power, fast-switching applications. Current gains as high as 70,000 are obtained at low current levels. The current gain decreases at higher current levels because the parallel lateral transistor turns on. It is also demonstrated that complementary pairs of SCL transistors can be fabricated with three masking steps, including metalization."

   "Based on a statistical analysis of actual computer program address traces, some results are presented of a study aimed at deriving empirically valid stochastic models for program reference patterns in a computer system operating under demand paging. For the address traces examined, a semi-Markov model for the (univariate) point process of page exceptions is formulated and found to be an adequate characterization of the data."
"It has been shown that the cost W of a weight balanced binary tree satisfies the inequalities, H ≤ W ≤ H + 3, where H is the entropy of the set of the leaves. For a class of “smooth” distributions the inequalities, H ≤ W ≤ H + 2, are derived.<p>These results imply that for sets with large entropy the search times provided by such trees cannot be substantially shortened when binary decisions are being used."
"File organizations utilizing key-to-address transformation and open addressing are studied. A simulation method and a Markov model, which were used for evaluation, are presented. The cost of retrieval as a function of storage space and accesses is also formulated. The minimum of the combined costs for different operational conditions is determined."
"The Gamma probability distribution is defined by the density function [βαγ(α)]−1 exp (−x/β). This paper presents new estimators for the parameters α−1 and β. Required calculations are simple, primarily involving the inner product of certain elementary statistics and their logarithms. Both of the new estimators are shown to be unbiased. The variance formulas for each and their covariance formula are derived—counterparts of these for the method of moments (MM) and the method of maximum likelihood (ML) not being known except in the asymptotic form. Curve-fitting results from samples of size 50 are provided. They support the proposition that the new quasimaximum likelihood estimators (QML) are at least as effective as MM and ML estimators. Illustrative estimation based on samples of size 5 also is presented for comparison; the results highlight relative smaller variances for the ML estimators. The same Monte Carlo results signal a possibility that significant negative bias occurs with both the MM and ML techniques if small samples are used."
"This paper extends the direct-tunneling theory of MNOS memory device behavior to account for traps that are distributed both spatially and energetically. It shows that the Pulver and Dorda model is a special case of the Ross and Wallmark model, which is itself a restricted version of the more general theory proposed here. A general equation for the total charge transfer is derived, for monoenergetic and for energetically uniform trap distributions, for high fields as well as low fields. The theory predicts the time dependence of the total charge transfer to be initially linear, then roughly logarithmic, and finally to reach saturation. There is no essential difference in the results whether the trap distribution is monoenergetic or energetically uniform. The operational dependence on characteristic parameters is investigated and found to be greatest for changes in the extent of spatial distribution of traps. The switching time varies inversely with trap density and tunnelling probability, and exponentially with the oxide thickness."
"Array theory combines APL with set theory, transfinite arithmetic, and operationally transformed functions to produce an axiomatic theory in which the theorems hold for all arrays having any finite number of axes of arbitrary countable ordinal lengths. The items of an array are again arrays. The treatment of ordinal numbers and letters is similar to Quine's treatment of individuals in set theory. The theory is developed first as a theory of lists. This paper relates the theory to the eight axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, describes the structure of arrays, interprets empty arrays in terms of vector spaces, presents a system of axioms for certain properties of operations related to the APL function of reshaping, deduces a few hundred theorems and corollaries, develops an algebra for determining the behavior of operations applied to empty arrays, begins the axiomatic development of a replacement operator, and provides an informal account of unions. Cartesian products, Cartesian arrays, and outer, positional, separation, and reduction transforms."
"Two new types of automatic equalizers for telephone lines are discussed. The modular configurations shown are designed for minimum adjustment time and are ready to receive data as soon as the response of the unequalized line has been measured. Two forms of such equalizers are compared with respect to upper bounds on the residual distortion."

   "This paper compares the performances—when applied to stationary EEG signals—of two methods of modeling stochastic time-series; viz, a maximum-likelihood search method for a mixed autoregressive and moving-average time-series, and the well-known method of least-squares identification of a prefiltered autoregressive series. Computing effort per step is derived for different-order search strategies, expressed in the number of a set of basic operations and also in equivalent number of likelihood function evaluations. Power spectra and total computing effort are evaluated and compared for four representative EEG samples. It appears that the least-squares method is generally superior because iteration is not needed, and in spite of the fact that higher orders are needed instead."
"A conventional method of removing unwanted background information from radiographic images is to use photographic techniques. An alternative approach is the digital processing of x-ray difference images. This approach offers the advantage over photographic methods in that it permits the performance of nonlinear operations, such as compensation for film characteristics, thus offering greater flexibility in the presentation of x-ray images and greater reliability in their interpretation. This paper describes the features and implementation of a new digital approach and presents experimental results obtained from processing two sets of angiograms."
"The excitability of various regions of the spinal motorneuron can be specified by solving the partial differential equation of a nerve fiber whose diameter and membrane properties vary with distance. For our model geometrical factors for the myelinated axon, initial segment and cell body were derived from anatomical measurements, the dendritic tree was represented by its equivalent cylinder, and the current-voltage relations of the membrane were described by a modification of the Hodgkin-Huxley model that fits voltage-clamp data from the motorneuron. In order to compute spike waveforms that match experimental observations, 1) the dendritic membrane must be inexcitable, 2) the voltage threshold of the initial segment of the axon must be ten millivolts lower than that of the cell body, and 3) the density of sodium conductance in the initial segment must be ten times greater than in a typical unmyelinated axon."
"The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of an on-going collaborative effort of research physicians, computer scientists, and statisticians to develop a quantitative way of understanding the clinical course of a critically ill and injured patient. The method is based on a multivariable analysis of time series of individual physiologic measurements. The ultimate goal is to reduce a large body of complex physiologic data to an information base that is relatively small and simple so that abnormal patterns may be exposed in a manner that can be directly interpreted and utilized at the bedside by the attending clinician to improve patient care. In this paper we describe some contributions made toward reaching this goal."
"The results of an experimental study of the performance of very high density 8, 128, and 256 bit CCD shift register structures are presented. The primary topics discussed include transfer efficiency, frequency response, impact of “fat zero” operation, and observed temperature dependency."
"A theoretical analysis of coupled and uncoupled lossless transmission lines is presented. A new method for deriving the conductance matrix G is described. Networks containing such lines have been simulated in the time domain and some results obtained from simulation of two example networks are given."
"A technique is described for determining refractive index dispersion throughout the uv-visible spectrum in semiconductor-related transparent thin films. The dispersion constants that have been measured can be used in the design of optical systems and in photolithography. Measurements were made with the LASER-VAMFO interferometer. Calculations and analyses are also described which show the accuracy and repeatability of the technique. Data were taken for 28 different thin-film materials, and representative refractive index dispersion curves are shown for some of them. The dispersion constants for each material evaluated are also presented."
"This paper outlines a resource allocation strategy called deadline scheduling, which is intended for use in interactive systems. Experiments are reported in which simplified versions of deadline scheduling and two time slicing strategies are modeled and compared under identical conditions. Results suggest that deadline scheduling, primarily by reducing paging overhead, provides faster response and supports more interactive users concurrently than do the two time slicing methods."
"The semiclassical analysis of acoustoelectric effects involves an infinite sum S(c,x) = ic exp (−x) ∑n=−∞=∞ (n + ic)−1In(x), in which both arguments c and x depend on the magnetic field B. Recently Lebwohl, Carlson, and Mosekilde have found an integral representation for this sum, through which now we identify S(c,x) as a generalized hypergeometric function. Moreover we derive an asymptotic series for S(c,x) in the limit of small B, whose coefficients, in a parameter z, involve the iterated integrals of the complementary error function."

   "A two-dimensional mathematical analysis is presented of the mechanisms of operation for an insulated gate field effect transistor (IGFET). Included in this analysis are qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional one-dimensional theory and a rigorous two-dimensional computer solution for the IGFET. It is shown that many characteristics of device operation deduced from conventional theory cannot be verified on a two-dimensional basis because of mechanisms not presently taken into consideration by the theory. A modified one-dimensional mathematical theory is therefore proposed, to account for these mechanisms, that is in adequate agreement with a rigorous two-dimensional computer solution for this semiconductor problem."
"This paper describes a single-server queuing model with Erlang input, which can be used for computer congestion analysis. The model is intended primarily for small computer systems in which the CPU is needed for input/output operations, which aggravates the interference problem. The model provides such information as the queuing time distribution for channel requests and the CPU delay due to channel interference. The model is illustrated by numerical examples, and procedures for the analysis are shown."
"A file of fixed-length records in auxiliary storage using a key-to-address transformation to assign records to addresses is considered. The file is assumed to be in steady state, that is that the rates of additions to and of deletions from the file are equal. The loading factors that minimize file maintenance costs in terms of storage space and additional accesses are computed for different bucket sizes and different operational conditions."
"Precise calculations have been made, by Monte Carlo methods, of electron transport properties of the Esaki superlattice. The calculations were on a single-particle space-homogeneous basis, with a model of the superlattice which could be reasonably close to reality. Steady-state longitudinal drift-velocity/field characteristics were obtained, for four sets of parameter values; they exhibited the expected maximum followed by negative differential mobility. The accompanying variations of the longitudinal and transverse energy averages were also obtained, and the distribution functions for longitudinal wavevector and transverse energy were investigated. The frequency dependences of the differential mobilities (in-phase and out-of-phase components) were obtained in some representative cases; they exhibited a “Bloch resonance.”"
"A deterministic model is proposed for the description of predator-prey systems in which the prey has an age-specific vulnerability to predation. The model is developed on the basis of observations of the moose and wolf populations of Isle Royale, Michigan. The moose are divided into three groups, the very young, the adults, and the very old or sick. The three groups have different vulnerability to predation by a single population of wolves. The model incorporates a saturation effect for the moose population and a satiation effect for the wolf population. It appears to reproduce quite well the almost monotonic trend toward equilibrium observed since the arrival of wolves on the island."
"A digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is described that has transformer-coupled isolation for both power and data inputs and provides a true differential output. The DAC provides a 10-bit, 10.23-V unipolar output of either polarity, depending on which of the two output lines is used as the load reference potential. The common-mode potential may be as large as 250 V, and below 120 Hz the common-mode rejection typically exceeds 100 dB. The isolated, balanced circuit eliminates environmental noise problems and permits long cabling lengths without loss of dc accuracy. The DAC is an analog output feature available on the IBM System/7, a small computer designed for data acquisition and real-time automation applications."
"We report here the operational characteristics of multistable resistance switching devices made from thin sputtered layers of AlN. These devices exhibit switching between high and low resistance states when proper electrical signals are applied. Repetitive switching at 20-MHz rates has been achieved, and switching times in the best units have been observed to be less than 500 picoseconds. These are believed to be the first active electronic switching devices to be reported utilizing AlN."
"We have found that sputtered amorphous films of Gd-Co and Gd-Fe have perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The demagnetized domain configuration consists of stripe domains, and bubble domains were nucleated in an applied field. By controlling the sputtering conditions, films with a wide variety of magnetic properties were obtained."
"An experimental programming language called APLGOL adds structured programming facilities to the existing framework of APL. The conventional semantics of APL is unaltered and only minor changes are incorporated in the syntax. The advantages of the proposed interstatement structuring and control are outlined."

 "Hierarchies are fundamental in the study of many kinds of complex systems. Methods are presented that assist in the development of a hierarchy or a set of hierarchies. Once the element set and the relations among the elements are established, the rationalizing procedure presented allows computer determination of how many separate hierarchies are represented by the relations among the elements. An example of the rationalization process is given. Two methods-the element method and the level method-are given for developing a hierarchy for a connected subordination matrix. Each method is illustrated with an example."
"The process of goal formation is presently inefficient- suffering from neglect, confusion of nomenclature, problems of group dynamics, and other difficulties. Intent structures furnish a practical mechanism for use in individual or group formation of goals. Such structures can become a kind of portrait of an organization, characterizing it much more effectively than an organization chart. Intent structures can also serve as a basis for managing complex system programs. Examples of intent structures are given which relate to education and new city design."
"An interactive system designed to study the spatial aspects of urban growth in Santa Clara County, San Jose, Calif., is described. The system is built around a mathematical model of urban growth and provides hands-on control of input, operation of the model, and data display."
"A method of using one or more ground-level air pollution transducers to detect anomalous emission from a fixed point source of air pollution is described. It is assumed a source can be identified by two position variables and three operating parameters. It is possible to spot the source position within a region A ∈ E2 if the operating parameters are partially known. The method is based on the principle of source-receptor reciprocity and certain mapping theorems. Mathematical questions arise when finding the set A. One question involves a technique for finding the set A from points on its boundary. Another question deals with the variations in the area of A with the amount of uncertainty in the operating parameters. The questions are resolved by recourse to general characteristics of diffusion patterns. An example is given to illustrate one application of the theory."
"Probabilistic prediction generally involves the consideration of information from many different sources, and this information must be aggregated to determine a single probability (or probability distribution). This paper is concerned with the aggregation process, and although some aspects of the paper are new, much of the paper is tutorial in nature. Models of the aggregation process are discussed, with particular emphasis on the question of the conditional dependence of information, and measures of the redundancy of information are developed. In addition, a review of previous experiments concerning the aggregation process is given, along with suggestions for experiments that should provide additional insight into the nature and ``efficiency'' of this process. In view of the importance of probabilistic prediction in inferential and decision-making situations, additional investigation and experimentation concerning the aggregation process should be of considerable value."
"Two catalyst regeneration problems are described. The major concern is with the reduction of storage and computations when implementing a dynamic programming strategy. Finally, tactics used in applying dynamic programming to a general resource allocation model are described."
"This paper proposes dynamic programming search procedures to expedite the feature subset selection processes in a pattern recognition system. It is shown that in general the proposed procedures require much fewer subsets to be evaluated than the exhaustive search procedure. For example, a problem of selecting the best subset of 4 features from a set of 24 features requires an evaluation of (24/4) = 10626 subsets by using the exhaustive search procedure; on the other hand, it requires only 175 and 136 subsets to be considered by employing the proposed Procedures I and II, respectively, to solve the same problem. While the number of subsets to be evaluated for the dynamic programming search procedures is slightly greater than that for the without-replacement search procedure, the best feature subset selected by the proposed methods may, however, not necessarily contain all of the best single features selected in the previous stages."
"This paper describes the results of experimental investigation of two-feature evaluation criteria, i.e., inter-intra class distance ratio and information content measure. These two indirect statistical measures take into account higher order statistical redundancies among the feature being evaluated. The algorithms are first presented and then they are applied and compared to recognize handprinted alphanumeric characters. Both Highleyman's data and raw data obtained in the Signal Processing Laboratory at Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, were used for the study. It is believed that the criteria can be used for other applications and can especially be used where the statistical independency among features is not assumed."
"A body of theory has been developed regarding multilevel coordination [1]. With applications sparse, the objective of this work is to relate and interpret a portion of the theory for control for the class of complex processes with sequential subprocesses. An example is formulated utilizing the Hot Strip Mill, including modification of current operating practice motivated by the coordination philosophy."
"The effects of aural, visual, and combined displays on human tracking performance were evaluated by means of the critical tracking task which employs an unstable controlled element. Four visual displays and an aural display were used in this study. Values of λc, the critical root or maximum degree of instability, were developed for each display alone and also for the visual displays used in combination with the aural presentation. These experiments were motivated by the results of a previous study by the authors which indicated that combined displays might lead to improved performance. Tracking performance, as measured by λ,sub>c, was consistently better for combined visual and aural presentations than for either type of display used alone. This trend was exhibited for each of the four visual displays and for both experienced and inexperienced trackers. These results suggested that combined displays supply greater net usable information to the human's central processor, allowing a significant reduction in estimation errors by the human operator. The effects of external disturbance input to the tracking loop were investigated. Tracking performance was degraded with increasing disturbance amplitude but no clear trends with bandwidth were noted."
"A restraint-pair formulation for system equality and inequality restraints in both state and control variables is synthesised using ``zero-zone'' function forms. The resulting unification of different categories of algebraic restraints leads to simplified problem representations and to systematic programming routines for problems in restrained optimization."
"A class of asymptotically ε-optimal two-armed bandit controllers is given, and two criteria for comparing thelong-term finite-time performance of controllers in this class are proposed. The performances of three particular controllers are compared using the criteria, and the analysis is confirmed by computer iteration if the appropriate probability recurrence relations."
"A relaxation method mapping high-dimensional sample points to low-dimensional sample points is discussed. This method tries to preserve the local interdistance of sample points. Some special heuristics have been introduced to handle the difficulty arising from a large amount of data. Experimental results with handwritten character data and Iris data show that the method runs fast, converges rapidly, and requires a small amount of memory space."
"This correspondence derives formulas for updating the mean vector and covariance matrix of a training class as new training fields are included and old training fields deleted from the class. These statistics of the class are expressed in terms of the already available statistics of the fields."
"Of the several methods that have been proposed for imagery data compression, the Karhunen-Loève procedure minimizes the meansquare error between the original and reconstructed imagery data. In spite of its optimality property, the Karhunen-Loève procedure has not been widely used because of its computational complexity. The main difficulty is in the computation of the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the imagery data since the dimension of the covariance matrix is usually large. A computationally short procedure for calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix is presented. We show that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the N × N bisymmetric covariance matrix can be obtained from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of two N/2 × N/2 submatrices. Since the eigenvector calculations are proportional to the third power of the matrix dimension, the proposed procedure reduces the computations by a factor of four."
"Comments are made regarding the collection of user preference data for varying characteristics of time-sharing systems. These ``utility functions,'' when determined for a number of variables, can be used as an aid to managers and designers of time-sharing service facilities. There are, however, several practical problems in assessing utility functions of more than one variable. These stem mainly from the fact that utility functions of several variables are generally not simple additive functions of utilities for single variables. In most cases they are complex functions consisting of many more component utility functions than the number of variables. This difficulty stems from the fact that preferences for a set of variables describing a service facility (such as a time-sharing system) are generally not independent of current values of other variables. This is known as ``utility dependence.'' If, however, a sufficient number of ``utility independence'' relationships can be found (by interview procedures) then it is possible to assess multidimensional utility functions with a more practical effort. Procedures for this assessment and uses of utility functions in managing a time-sharing system are described here."

 "This is a speculative position paper on a very large-scale system which may be suitable as a national goal. The paper discusses some of the pros and cons of constructing a large free-standing city in the U.S. in this decade. It then illustrates the initiation of planning using basic graphical techniques."
"An approach is presented for planning a health care system on a regional basis. The major components of the process are embodied in four computerized models: a demographic model; a facilities-location model; a regional and local model of the interactions of physicians, patients, and facilities; and a model which uses dynamic programming to determine the best strategy to follow in sequentially altering the health care system. Each of these models is described and representative results from each are presented."
"This is a survey of some illustrative mathematical and econometric models. Both purely theoretical and applied models are discussed, and the limits of their utilization indicated. The recent disturbances of the economy have raised questions about public policy and the kind of controls which might be implemented. The use of optimal control theory in economics and, in particular, its application to planning problems is examined. Forecasting and simulation applications of the Wharton econometric model are considered."
"The approach described in this paper represents a substantive departure from the conventional quantitative techniques of system analysis. It has three main distinguishing features: 1) use of so-called ``linguistic'' variables in place of or in addition to numerical variables; 2) characterization of simple relations between variables by fuzzy conditional statements; and 3) characterization of complex relations by fuzzy algorithms. A linguistic variable is defined as a variable whose values are sentences in a natural or artificial language. Thus, if tall, not tall, very tall, very very tall, etc. are values of height, then height is a linguistic variable. Fuzzy conditional statements are expressions of the form IF A THEN B, where A and B have fuzzy meaning, e.g., IF x is small THEN y is large, where small and large are viewed as labels of fuzzy sets. A fuzzy algorithm is an ordered sequence of instructions which may contain fuzzy assignment and conditional statements, e.g., x = very small, IF x is small THEN Y is large. The execution of such instructions is governed by the compositional rule of inference and the rule of the preponderant alternative. By relying on the use of linguistic variables and fuzzy algorithms, the approach provides an approximate and yet effective means of describing the behavior of systems which are too complex or too ill-defined to admit of precise mathematical analysis."
"Great promise is shown by combining man and computers via interactive graphics to solve problems neither could solve alone. The behavior of man in this problem-solving combination must be studied just as any computer problem-solving system. The example problem studied is parameter estimation. After collecting observational data, a mathematical model of the data generation process is constructed which generates predicted data which varies according to some parameters of the model. The problem is to find parameters which ``fit'' predicted data to collected data. Three methods are typically used to solve this problem: calculate parameters as a function of the observational data, ``grid search'' the parameter space, and ``hill climb'' in the parameter space. In all these procedures, ``feel'' of the data and model are lost. Systematic differences may be present which suggest data collection errors or a need to reformulate the model. An interactive graphics curve-fitting procedure has been developed which both fits curves and gives the man some feel of the process. Collected data are displayed. The man then iteratively enters trial parameters and immediately observes the predicted data along with the collected data (and other predicted data curves). Collected data for problems with two parameters were generated using linear, sinusoidal, exponential, and logrithmic models to which random error and sometimes systematic error components were added. Collected data for problems with four parameters were generated using a model of short-term memory and random error."
"We present a model of threshold learning that represents discrete one-dimensional learning processes by a continuous two-dimensional learning process. The model gives us an overall view of the learning dynamics of an expanded range of training procedures, and provides insight into the training of multidimensional linear pattern classifiers. In our model the expected performance is measured by learning curves, and the confidence in this expected performance is measured by variance curves. Previous work on the continuous approximation has been restricted to one-dimensional learning processes. The theory developed here promises to lead to improved training procedures and improved rules for determining when to stop training."
"The use of a gradient search algorithm for the computation of the minimum of a function is well understood. In particular, in continuous time, the algorithm can be formulated as a differential equation whose equilibrium solution is a local minimum of the function. Khas'minskii has proposed using the continuous gradient algorithm with a white-noise driving term. He shows, using an argument on the convergence of the probability density function, that the equilibrium solution of this differential equation is the global minimum of the function. This paper reviews that result from the point of view of the theory of diffusion processes. It is shown that the conclusion of Khas'minskii is not correct, and that in fact the operation of the stochastic gradient search is the same as the operation of the noise-free gradient search. In fact, the search with noise converges with probability one to any of the local minima in the same way as the noise-free search converges to a local minimum. Several stochastic adaptive control systems use random search algorithms for their operation. One of these, due to Barron, is analyzed to show that it meets the conditions for convergence imposed by the results which have been derived here."
"An algorithm for classifying a data set into an initially unknown number of categories is presented. It is composed of procedure for selecting initial points, a mode estimation procedure, and a classification rule. An integer valued function is defined on the sample space and a gradient search technique is used for estimating its modes. A procedure for mode estimation in the case of an infinite data set is also proposed. Sufficient conditions for the convergence to the neighborhood of the modes have been stated. The algorithm was used for clustering multicategory artificially generated data sets and was compared with an optimal classification scheme."
"This paper presents properties of several different algorithms suitable for multicategory classification of hand-printed alphanumeric characters. In the character reader the input patterns are generally composed of the template characters and their distorted ones. Using the template patterns, a nonparametric procedure is developed for determining linear discriminant functions. Furthermore, we propose the mechanism which has the ability to recognize even a misprinted character by using the information of the preceding character. The algorithms offer the following advantages: flexibility (cost assignments), simplicity, adaptation, and acceptable performance. Performance of the machines is analyzed and convergence proofs of the learning procedures in the machines are derived. We also present some results of computer experiments."
"A trajectory optimization technique for multidimensional nonlinear processes is presented. Problems which are cast in a discrete-time mold are considered. The method is based on dynamic programming and employs a combination of the technique of functional approximation and the method of region-limiting strategies. The cost function at each stage is approximated by a quadratic polynomial in a region which is restricted to be of a size judged appropriate to reduce the error in the approximation. Minimal costs are evaluated at a set of points, called base points. A new control trajectory and an improved state trajectory are then generated within an extrapolation region. The iterative application of this procedure yields an optimal trajectory. Contained in the algorithm is a simple procedure which eliminates matrix inversion to determine the coefficients of the approximating polynomial. The present algorithm is applicable to problems with one bounded control action. It accounts for inequality constraints on state variables in a straightforward manner. The algorithm is applied to solve a number of trajectory optimization problems."
"Some gray-level manipulation techniques are described, the first of which involves changing the gray-level distribution within the picture. Thereafter a method for extracting relatively noise-free objects from a noisy background is described. The purpose of these techniques is to preprocess a textural scene for subsequent analysis or classification. The present state of the art of texture analysis in general does not enable the parameters associated with the techniques to be generalized. Results for a range of parameters for both real and computer-generated pictures are therefore given."
"A learning model of fuzzy formal language is proposed and discussed. We continue training the learning machine by giving sets of sentences sequentially. As a result of parsing of the given teaching sentences, the learning machine reinforces fuzzy grades of membership of productions in an inherent fuzzy grammar of the machine. The convergence of the proposed model is considered, and it is shown that the grades of membership of desired productions are intensified by choosing an adequate teaching sequence of the sentence set. Furthermore, a concept of ``strongly equivalent,'' in which two grammars are not distinguished by any teaching sequence, is introduced."
"A heuristic search is described which has the aim of finding practically all the extrema of a given nonlinear functional. A standard unimodal descent algorithm is employed for finding individual extrema. This basic algorithm is applied repeatedly using various computed initial points and starting directions. Through the additional use of several learning cycles most of the available extrema can be found. Numerical experiments indicate that the method is very efficient for the functionals of dimensions 15-20 with 20-25 extrema."
"The performance of variable-structure stochastic automata in stationary random environments has been extensively studied for the case when the environment's response is 0 or 1 (P model). A method is suggested for extending the updating schemes known for the P model to the S model, where the environment's output can lie in the interval [0,1], and a class of optimal nonlinear schemes for the S model is derived. Computer simulations reveal the superior performance of the S model in multimodal search even when the bounds on the performance function are unknown."

"A series of nondestructive tests utilizing a new thermal detector, known as a thermal transducer, has been conducted on a group of large carbon-carbon test cones. A description of the operating principles and special fixtures required to use the thermal transducer is provided. Results of thermal and other standard NDT methods are compared and recommendations regarding the capabilities of the thermal transducer are made."
"Nondestructive test methods have traditionally been involved in the detection of localized or point defects such as cracks, voids, and inclusions. However, there has been an increasing demand for meaningful NDT methods that characterize material properties over large surface areas or within the entire volume of a component or structure. Infrared techniques, which lend themselves to area and volume coverage, have been refined for this purpose to a high degree. Simultaneously, there has been a major effort to increase the effectiveness and utility of the large amounts of data resulting from IR scans. This paper concentrates on data enhancement methods, using both real-time and computer-treatment techniques. The data reduction methods covered are significant departures from present NDT data presentations and are aimed primarily at the major ``IR customers''-the materials and design engineers."
"For military applications, the use of a flexible package as a replacement for metal cans, particularly for operational rations, has been of interest for many years. Progress has been made to the point where the logistical, functional, and durability advantages of a flexible package of commercially sterile ready-to-eat food, the so called ''Flex-Pack,'' to replace the 300 × 200 (3\" diameter by 2\" height) can in combat rations have been proven. The U.S. Army Natick Laboratories (Department of Defense) is in the final stages of testing the reliability of a flexible packaging system for single-serving portions of heat-processed foods [1]. Unlike the frozen, boil-in-bag system, these packages of food are shelf stable and commercially sterile and, therefore, the integrity of the package must be positively maintained to prevent bacterial entry and subsequent spoilage of the food product."

"A novel electrofluidic device resulted from the investigation of an electrostatic field on the motion of charged dielectric fluid for converting fluidic signals to electrical and vice versa has been developed. A linear static mathematical model has been worked out from the first principles. It is shown that the mathematical model developed is capable of predicting the behavior of the electrofluidic converter to a certain degree of approximation and helps in the design process. Theoretical and experimental results are presented and discussed. In electrofluidic mode of operation it was possible to convert fluidic signal of 10-4 M3/Sec to electrical signal of 10-7 A."
"While charging large capacitor banks from a constant-voltage source the initial charging current can be excessively large. Various methods are available to overcome this difficulty such as the use of a series resistor, motorized auto-transformers, induction regulators, etc., which have certain disadvantages. This paper discusses a thyristor phase controlled capacitor charging system which enables programmable constant current charging. Further, ample standby power is available at the end of the charging cycle which helps in sustaining the voltage across the electrolytic capacitor banks which have comparatively high leakage."
"The paper describes an electronic switching device for the transient testing of small ac machines and network models. It is suitable for single-phase or three-phase operation. Precisely timed switching transients can be produced in any or all phases of the tested system. Switching operations in the individual phases can be performed simultaneously or with independent timing. The accuracy of timing is ± 0.5 electrical degree with a timing range from 0 to 2777 cycles. Thyristors are used as the main switching elements. They can continually carry 265 A r.m.s.; the peak inverse voltage across the switching elements is 600V. Several tests, which have been carried out with the device so far, are described and typical test results are given."
"Often subharmonic oscillations of firing angle of thyristor converters with large magnitude in negative feedback control systems are a kind of jump phenomena. For their investigation rectifiers may be modeled by an asymmetrical saturation type nonlinearity in series with a linear block whose factors depend upon the number of pulses of the rectifier and the order of subharmonic in question. Application of the incremental describing function technique results in a set of curves, which is useful for the determination of the critical gain of the system and its design. Results of digital computer simulated systems are in good agreement with the predicted values"
"It has been proven mathematically that with the application of a triangular perturbation signal quantized characteristics may be perfectly linearized for the ideal case [1], but that certain practical limitations will introduce errors if the signals are processed digitally [2]. In this paper the errors resulting from discrete sampling, imprecise triangular wave amplitude, and finite computer word size are examined experimentally and compared with the bounds established in [2]. In all cases the errors are well within the worst case predicted by the theory indicating that this method of resolution enhancement can be utilized where digital processing is required. The particular application reported here involves improving the resolution of an analog-to-digital converter."
"An all digital phase locked loop which tracks the phase of the incoming signal once per carrier cycle is proposed. The different elements and their functions, and the phase lock operation are explained in detail. The general digital loop operation is governed by a nonlinear difference equation from which a suitable model is developed. The lock range for the general model is derived. The performance of the digital loop for phase step and frequency step inputs for different levels of quantization without loop filter are studied. The analytical results are checked by simulating the actual system on the digital computer."
"Solid state dc motor drives are becoming increasingly popular. The inherent disadvantages of such drives are studied by considering a separately excited dc motor fed from a single-phase thyristor converter. The discontinuous and highly rippled armature current in solid state dc drives affect the commutating capability of the dc motor and its static and dynamic performances. A novel current control scheme is outlined which can restrict the amplitude of the current close to its average value and make current continuous over a wide range of operation. This converter-motor system with current-control-scheme is simulated on an analog as well as on a digital computer. The system is found to be potentially capable of providing various useful torque-speed characteristics without any change in the field circuit. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the system."
"Signal perturbation theory has been shown theoretically to reduce the quantization errors in position and velocity detection systems [1-9]. In the above work, some of the ideal constraints on the system were relaxed, but most of the practical problems associated with actual hardware were circumvented. This paper presents an experimental system and compares the experimental results obtained from the system with those predicted by the models."
 "Industrial instrumentation has long suffered from the bewildering number of units used in industry to measure process parameters. There are very few instrument engineers who have not, some time or another, made a mistake in converting units and consequently ordered equipment of the wrong size or incorrect range. The cost to industry in time and money is considerable. This paper provides an insight into SI units for coherent specification of requirements."

   "In a dc shunt generator, as the load increases the terminal voltage falls, giving a drooping characteristic. The regulation of voltage involves the adjustment of field excitation. A simple method of voltage regulation by automatic adjustment of field excitation making use of transistor circuitry is discussed. The added advantage of this method is that by the simple adjustment of circuit parameters, the characteristics of a compound generator can be achieved. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the method."
"The use of flywheels in industrial drives economizes many processes to a great extent, and the effective utilization of a flywheel necessitates, in many cases, the artificial speed reduction of motor from zero to full load. This paper demonstrates how a power transistor can be used to achieve this objective in a case where a dc shunt or compound motor is used for the drive."
"A simple switching network in form of a rectifier filter is analyzed with application of time-domain methods. Exact expressions are derived for currents in the filter network and the ac supply line as functions of the size of a series inductor in the L-type low pass filter connected to a resistive load. The power factor as viewed from the ac supply line is derived from the time-domain expressions for conditions of continuous and discontinuous current. A current form factor is introduced in form of the ratio irms/iav to provide a measure for the added burdens that are imposed on the circuit components due to current deformations inside the switching network. Normalized numerical results for average and rms currents, their form factor, output voltage, and power factor are presented as functions of the ratio of the series inductance L and the critical inductance Lc in form of graphs. The presented treatment of the problem provides insights and information which would require cumbersome work if approached with the conventional methods of frequency domain analysis. Rectifier-filer systems with series inductances L<Lc, the critical inductance for which the inductor current i=0 at times, have recently gained significance for systems that provide energy to voltage or current regulators."
"The advantages of digital circuits and the frequency-response design procedures that are available for specifying the coefficients of the digital-filter transfer function are discussed. The hardware design of a digital filter is discussed, and an example is given of the application of the filter in a servo loop. Further application of the filter to generate a notch network characteristic is illustrated."
"An inexpensive servo-motor-driven hinge-arm actuator device has been realized with the capability of producing linear displacements on the order of 0.5 μin. The device is applicable to precision control of machine tools and alignment of optical systems. Transfer-function and calibration data for the actuator are given.

"Improved position detection involving a one-dimensional photosensor array has been shown to be possible by applying a high-frequency perturbation signal to a normalized target image. A general analytical model which describes the receptor system with respect to receptor element threshold, perturbation amplitude (peak), and the deadspace between elements is presented. Functional-approximation theory is applied to determine necessary and sufficient conditions on the system parameters that optimize (Chebyshev) the system position transfer characteristic with respect to one that is linear."
"The flow chart for the SCR trigger module for use in a three-pulse cycloconverter circuit is discussed. Generalized equations for simulating the cycloconverter operation are derived. A mathematical expression for the digital computation of output voltage harmoniic components is derived in terms of the Fourier transform. The computed results of cycloconverter operation for an R-L load are presented."
"Several well-tested gating circuits for physical scale counts for fast reversal of bidirectional counters are described-all derived from the triple or more basic readout signals required to make such counting possible. Reversal errors are noted, and ways to reduce them. These arrangements are speed-limited. Direct-current-gating voltage producers are described for fast counters, together with problems arising from them. Note is made of inter-decade coupling in such circuits."
"A more thorough examination of an area-measurement system employing chemical arrays is presented. An improvement in area-measurement accuracy is obtained when the amplitude of the sinusoidal perturbation signal is increased beyond the array-connector separation. The measurement error for various images in different positions on the receptor-connector matrix is considered."
"A procedure was developed to extend time-optimum control of linear processes to a class of nonlinear processes consisting of a second-order overdamped linear process followed by a nomemory nonlinearity. Bang-bang control was combined with a proportional-integral-derivation (PID) controller to achieve time-optimum control for set-point changes and good regulator operation for minor disturbances. This dual-mode controller was implemented with a small digital computer. The settling time for step set-point changes with dual-mode control was compared to that with PID control alone. A factor of 2 improvement was achieved through time-optimum control. The dualmode control was successfully applied to an actual nonlinear process."
"In a solid-state relay-like device, the switching can be achieved by field effect transistors driven by photodiodes. Light-emitting diodes (LED) provide the illumination required. The only coupling between drive and load portions of the circuit is optical. Experimental results are presented here and indicate that this can be a useful relay replacement for many applications. The advantages are no switching contacts, no moving parts, long life, reliability, etc."

     "The application of a triangular perturbation signal as a means of improving the resolution of quantizers is discussed. The particular problems which occur with digital processing are examined. Inaccuracies caused by discrete sampling, and imprecise triangle wave amplitude are investigated, and relationships which bound the errors caused by these factors are established. These relationships are useful in designing the resolution-enhancement system."
"This paper is concerned with an investigation of the effects of scan speed and other system parameters on the disturbance-output transfer function for sheet process control systems employing scanning gauges. The shape of the transfer function points out the presence of an important system design parameter, the cross-over period, which effectively determines which disturbance frequencies the control system is capable of controlling against. A simple approximate expression for the dependence of this parameter on scan speed and other system parameters is developed, and its accuracy is estimated with the use of a digital simulation."
"The literature contains a variety of inverter circuits with forced commutation. In general, the auxiliary circuit for switching off the load current carrying thyristors is composed of a number of energy storage components and semiconductor switches which are affected by losses. These circuits demonstrate specific advantages under certain conditions. The analysis of a forced commutated inverter with a series LC-resonant circuit is presented in this article. The peak capacitor voltage depends on the quality of the resonant circuit and the ratio of the peak capacitor current vs. the maximum load current. This can cause high stresses on all the components of the inverter circuit. The set of equations for the circuit is established and used for the computation of results. The peaks of stored energy and the losses in the commutation circuit are calculated and given in a normalized form. Design parameters in normalized form are derived therefrom and presented in this article."
"The delay unit for digital filters can be realized with hardware in either of two ways, i.e., the analog and digital types. If accuracies between 0.1 and 1 percent are required, then it is known that the analog methods simplify the construction of the digital filters. This paper presents the delay unit for the digital filters using a single core which circumvents the problem of core matching. The magnetic delay unit has essentially no practical limitation on the long delay time. Therefore, the digital filters for very low frequencies can be easily realized. The characteristics of the core material to be required for such a unit are discussed and a method of practical realization is shown. In the practical unit, the delay time of 1 hour is realized without trouble. As to the relation between the input and output signals, an accuracy of within approximately 0.05 percent can be maintained when the whole supply voltage is changed by ±4 percent. Under the conditions of the temperature change from 20 to 50°C, there appears no drift caused by the change of temperature. For large variations of time during 24 hours, the drift is not observed experimentally, so that the above mentioned accuracy can be maintained. These facts show that the delay unit is fairly stable and reliable. As an example of a digital filter to be realized for the noise rejection, the simple first-order low-pass filter has been constructed by the method of the bilinear transformation."
"The paper considers the design of narrow-band notch networks with low center frequencies for application in servomechanisms. The S-plane transfer function of a notch network is expressed in a form that allows the notch to be specified from measured data. The bilinear and matched Z transformation methods are used to derive a digital transfer function and it is shown that reliable results can be achieved by either method. The effects of the choice of sampling frequency are discussed along with frequency folding. A guide to sampling time selection is given."
"The inherent instability of boiling processes in one of the boiling modes generates difficulties for many investigators. It was proposed to control the temperature of the heater in an elementary pool boiling heat transfer process, consisting of a metallic element (the heater) immersed in a boiling liquid and electrically energized so that boiling occurs at the interface between heater and liquid. Three boiling modes are in evidence, one of which is unstable under the usual operating conditions. It was expected that by controlling temperature, stable operation in all boiling modes could be obtained. An analog simulation of the boiling process was constructed, together with a simulation of a feedback system for controlling the simulated heater temperature, and it was found that the simulated temperature could be controlled. A feedback system was then designed and constructed for controlling the temperature of the actual heater. Analog components in the Donner Model 3400 analog computer were used to the maximum extent considered possible in this system. The process was in this way very successfully controlled. When the controlled system became available, experiments were performed to identify the static and dynamic characteristics of the process. New measurement methods were deviced using analog circuitry to obtain accurate measurements in the presence of noise generated by the process."
"A method is advanced for compensation design of discrete data systems which enables realization of both transient and steady-state requirements. The technique is carried out with the aid of a digital computer and extends to specification of more than two roots. Practical examples illustrate application of the method."
"This paper concerns an objective, analytical and experimental investigation of a novel control technique, namely, the feedforward technique. Following a brief literature survey outlining the genesis of the technique, a detailed analysis of an ideal feedforward servomechanism model is presented. In the analysis Liapunov's direct method has been used for the determination of the stability of the system. An estimate of the settling time of the system has also been made using the Liapunov function. Next, the experiments that were carried out on a simulated feedforward mechanism model are reported. The paper concludes with a suggestion on the possible use of this technique in the design of a model reference adaptive system, investigation on which is underway."
"The mutual effects on drum waterlevel and steam pressure due to sudden load changes of a boiler are to be studied by means of a suitable block diagram showing the steam pressure and waterlevel control loops and its mutual influence. Concerning normal load changes (ΔN<20 percent No), these interactions are mostly neglected, and the dynamic characteristics of both control loops are considered autonomous. However, if there appear sudden load changes (ΔN>20 percent No)-for instance, heating changes in waste-heat boilers, load steps at industry boilers or at boiler-turbine units, operating on a separate electrical grid-the mutual effects of the variables of both control loops are to be taken into account, too. The effects of those load changes on the time behavior of changes of both the waterlevel and the boiler pressure are to be investigated. The drop in pressure following the operation of the safety valves-for instance, if the value of the exhausted steam flow is not measurable and thus cannot be used as a feed-forward signal for the feedwater controller-and in consequence the amendments of the control diagram are to be taken into consideration."
"To hold the absolute maximum value of a physical quantity and to follow its increments, if any, is of interest in several measuring and control applications. A digital device, which accomplishes a solution of this problem, is presented. The design resorts to sequential machine techniques and makes possible the utilization of usual MSI counters."
"An instrument is described which measures the size of an egg by means of a non-contact microwave transducer. By a single frequency count it is possible to classify an egg in one of the four standard grades: extra large, large, medium, and small. Such measurements can be made, by an electronic counter, with the egg moving at conveyor belt speeds of up to 300 feet per minute. In this case the eggs must be at least six inches apart. The egg shape index may also be measured by taking two separate frequency counts as described in this paper."

"A simple method of reducing ripple in thyristor phase controlled d.c. power sources is described. Phase controlled power supplies are widely used in medium energy capacitor discharge systems using electrolytic capacitors. In the method outlined, the thyristor triggering is modified by the inclusion of a double time constant network in the unijunction transistor (UJT) trigger circuit. Reliability of triggering at low conduction angles is improved and the ripple is significantly reduced by this modification."
"A method for combined hardware software interfacing of synchro position transducers to digital control computers is given. The method uses two simple circuits for each synchro as well as two 8-bit memory words in the computer. The synchro analysis and service subroutines runs under the real time operating system."

  "International Electrotechnical Committee SC31G has been working for several years on a recommendation to cover the requirements for intrinsic safety. The Committee is nearing the completion of the document. Detailed requirements will differ from several of the existing national standards. It is time for a review of SC31G's activities and to compare results with the existing standards."
"Factory Mutual began testing and approval of intrinsically safe equipment in 1964. Approval requirements were developed using the Instrument Society of America Recommended Practice RP12.2 and data from European test agencies having extensive background in this subject. Since 1964, many instrument manufacturers have received Factory Mutual approval. Listings of approved equipment are published in the Factory Mutual Approval Guide."
"The Underwriters' Laboratories has been investigating intrinsically safe equipment for use in hazardous locations for many years. It has recently published a Standard for Intrinsically Safe Circuits and Equipment, UL913. This presentation traces the development of the intrinsically safe requirements from the initial outlines to the printed Standard. The contents of the Standard are briefly discussed as they would apply to process-control equipment and, also, to other types of electrical equipment having intrinsically safe circuits. A typical investigation of an intrinsically safe process-control system is presented. Construction and performance requirements are discussed. A sample circuit is selected to illustrate fault analysis and test conditions in the explosive atmosphere."
"A building-block approach to implementing remote supervisory control stations is described. By structuring the interface between functional blocks to be compatible with a mini-computer I/O bus, small hardwired remotes can be easily upgraded into programmable remotes. Several hardware/software tradeoffs are involved in the system design. By utilizing inexpensive MOS serial memories and limited processing in the individual functional blocks, a more powerful hardwired remote can be realized without reducing the flexibility of the larger programmable remote. This preprocessing also permits a small mini-computer to handle a remote with a large number of data points."
"Progress in the development and availability of digital supervisory control and data acquisition systems has led to wide-spread interest and exploration of new utility automation applications. Major attention is being directed to all facets of operation within the power plant and power system. This paper discusses the trends in supervisory control as applied to system security, computer-directed supervisory control, in-plant and substation remote multiplexing or line-sharing systems, substation and distribution system automation, programmable and read-only memory (ROM) based remotes, automatic generation control, and man-machine interface."
"The formulation of generalized state equations by using binary logic variables decided by the SCR and diode logic modules is discussed. Advantage of this method is that the state equations can be set up without the exact knowledge of the circuit operation. The different modes of operation of the circuit are identified by the computer itself. This method is applied to a chopper circuit with an RL load and the computed results are presented."
"A fully automatic system has been developed for measuring swelling pressure. The system is based on measurements of the contrabalancing force, which causes the swelling of the material."
"A new approach to the analysis of a high-frequency rectangular wave inverter provides a simple means for determining the commutation circuit components."
"A new thermistor working within a wide temperature range is presented. Processing techniques and thermal and electrical characteristics are described. The sensing element is ``pure'' crystal-line boron, and the contacts, performed through a nickel-boron alloy, allow the device to hold up to 990°C. The very high sensitivity, the stability over a wide temperature range, and the reproducibility all make the sensor both suitable for temperature measurements and promising in a wide field of applications."
"The feasibility of using chopper circuits in ac supply to provide variable dc output is investigated. The three basic chopper circuits are considered and their input and output characteristics are thoroughly studied for direct ac/dc conversion. The performances of these ac-fed choppers for two types of control, time-ratio control (TRC) and phase-shift control (PSC), are compared. One chopper circuit is found to provide better performance characteristics than the other two choppers. The three ac-fed choppers are tested on experimental models to verfy theoretical predictions."
"A leaky-flux filament transformer is used in a method for restricting the filament switching on current surge. Considering a lossless filament transformer, a correct design formula is derived for the open-circuit secondary voltage of the transformer. This is compared with a formula given in the literature [2], and the relevant error is calculated. Useful universal plots are given which permit a quick determination of the open-circuit secondary voltage. References are given [1] to other details on the design of filament current-surge restricting devices for high-power electronic tubes."
"The rate at which a ship consumes fuel is nonlinearly related to both speed and amount of fuel in the ship's tanks. A model for this phenomenon is developed. The problem of finding the velocity pattern (as a function of time) necessary to move the ship between two fixed points in a fixed amount of time is then considered. It is determined that the optimal velocity pattern is a constant. A typical numerical example is presented to illustrate the savings in fuel which might result when compared to other possible velocity patterns."
"A simple technique is presented for using standard IC logic elements to synthesize frequencies. In particular, certain fractional multiples of a primary frequency may be synthesized for which no convenient techniques are available at digital logic levels. By utilizing the harmonic content of repetitive digital waveforns, sum and difference frequencies may be extracted from the output of the digital logic network. In effect, the new technique provides a type of digital mixing to accomplish frequency synthesis (or conversion) which is compatible with modern digital circuits. The circuit complements available techniques for division by an integer."

"AFTER last issue's “orgy” of mathematical, systems, and operations research-type papers, we had hoped that the current issue would restore the balance between such approaches and the behavioral or management-type articles. Several of the papers are, in fact, in the latter category. Authors of two of the six papers are in industry. However, there is still strong emphasis on more analytical attempts to understand and improve the Research, Development, and Engineering (RD&E) process. From the viewpoints of a highly technical professional society (IEEE) and the people attempting to improve the RD&E process from inside and from outside, this is not a bad situation. Although hunches, insights, and stimulation may result from general discussion papers on problems of managing RD&E, significant improvement in the art will require a much stronger analytical base than now exists."
"An example of the use of dynamic programming for R/D resource allocation in the aerospace industry is described. Procedures for developing the required input data are described, and a quantitative comparison is made of the effectiveness of resource allocation by dynamic programming vis-a-vis a conventional method. It is shown that dynamic programming can result in significant improvements in program effectiveness."
"A large number and variety of management and engineering techniques (such as PERT, value engineering, and configuration management) have been implemented over the past decade to improve the technical, cost, and schedule performance of government-sponsored R&D projects. However, such R&D efforts continue to be plagued with technical, schedule, and cost difficulties. The intent of the research reported here was to determine if the required performance of management and engineering techniques resulted in a measurable difference in project technical, schedule, and cost performance. The study utilized performance and control data collected from 108 government-sponsored R&D projects which occurred in the 1950-1967 time period. The major findings of the study were 1) the application of a large volume and variety of management control techniques to R&D projects could not be statistically associated with levels of project technical, schedule, and cost difficulties that were lower than was encountered in projects not having such control; and 2) the application of a large volume and variety of management control techniques to R&D projects tends to be associated with greater numbers of technical, schedule, and cost failures than were associated with projects not having such control."
"A new quantitative systematic procedure, called a cost relevance tree, for group objective evaluation of development projects for their eventual cost-reduction effectiveness in a given segment of a business is described. The procedure is applied to the construction, repair, and rearrangement of Bell System underground (conduit) plant. This systematic procedure quantifies recent and applicable costs, projects these costs into the future, and finally provides a format of development project program rankings where future underground plant innovations can be identified and evaluated. This procedure is an extension of Honeywell's PATTERN technique attempting to add some economic dimension without undue complexity to the relative value of development projects. While similar to the Delphi method in the use of expert evaluation, attempts to achieve its controlled, but time-consuming, independent thinking were not made. Resultant data deficiencies plus a lack of benefit-cost analysis and the uncertainties of future projections are compensated by a sensitivity analysis. This analysis also shows the effect of input data uncertainty on project ranking."
"Many models of research and development (R&D) projects do not consider the intermediate outcomes and decisions that may be foreseen to arise during their evolution through the technical and commercial stages. Consideration of the sequential aspects of allocating scarce resources to a set of projects may make a great difference to the solution of the problem in terms of the optimum subset of projects to work on in the immediate future. The solution of this problem is important to R&D management. An approach is described based on the application of a stochastic linear-programming formulation to a portfolio of projects, each planned using a form of the decision-tree structure called a `project tree.' A series of elementary examples are presented as a means of gaining insight into the method. The general formulation is then presented in detail and applied to a small problem."
"Administration of an innovative task team today requires a capability to integrate not only the interrelated technical disciplines but also the relationships of the individual members as well. The team leader needs a tool to measure and characterize the members so that he can predict their interactions and structure his task teams accordingly. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Test, which places individuals in a scheme of personality types as established by the Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, was used effectively in a scientific task-team management situation. Jung theorized that such apparently random variations in human behavior is actually orderly and consistent and reflects certain basic differences in the way people prefer to use perception and judgement in a given situation."
"The allocation of organization resources to the R&D function remains one of the most complex and least rational decision processes of management. The purpose of this note is to examine the process and the implied attributes required of formal prescriptive models which will improve the process. Characteristics of the allocation problem are discussed briefly. This provides a rationale for listing those attributes which formal models should exhibit in order to contribute meaningfully to the rationality of the allocation process."

"INSTEAD OF the usual brief description of the papers in the current issue (generally accompanied by a wider discussion of problems related to the paper topics), this editorial contains the report of and some comments about a recent survey of IEEE publications, Including this TRANSACTIONS. Each IEEE publication, including the TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT, was reviewed by a special panel, and a readership survey was made of a “significant number” of members of the relevant group (e.g. G-EM)."
"The results of a field study identify the leadership style that may optimize project performance in a project-oriented environment. The relationships of a project manager's leadership style to the degree of support he receives from project personnel is examined and related to project performance and effectiveness as judged by general management. The findings may help the professional manager in the field of project management to identify what type of leadership style optimizes the project performance. The paper concludes that work challenge and expertise as intrinsic motivation factors appear to be the most important influence methods for establishing a climate of high support, while authority and penalty methods appear to hinder the development of such a climate."
"Efficient start-up management can result in considerable productivity increases compared to improvements possible in `steady-state' activities. Provided adequate targets are set and updated in accordance with realistic productivity expectation, management can interact rapidly in order to achieve optimum performance. Such a management process is dependent on the availability of suitable methods of predicting future productivity and estimating present productivity in the presence of random fluctuation due to many causes. This paper develops a predictive start-up model which performs both these functions. At each observation time, observed productivity is compared with predicted productivity as estimated from previous data, the difference being used to update the model parameters in a manner analogous to exponential smoothing. The model is applied to a number of start-up problems and is shown to track the parameters in an acceptable fashion. Long- and short-term productivity predictions resulting from the model are shown to be a useful management aid."
"The design, implementation, and use of a model for scheduling the production of nuclear isotopes is presented. The model is formulated as a multiple-period linear-programming (LP) problem with several classes of product-demand, inventory, and production-level constraints. An important feature of the model is its role in managing in-process inventories over the extended period of time required for the production of certain isotopes. Considerable discussion is given to practical issues surrounding the model implementation and the model's many production and marketing applications."

"Although much attention has been given to the potential impact of capital expenditures for pollution-abatement equipment on the operating effectiveness and organization of American industry, little or no attention has been given to the amount of diversion from traditional endeavors which environmental-control requirements have caused in industrial R&D and the subsequent impacts of this diversion. This paper deals explicitly with the former of these concerns, namely how industry allocates its R&D resources in a transition period following the imposition of previously ignored operating and product requirements by the government."

"IN VIEW of the many comments made in these editorials and by members of the Engineering Management Group about the need for more articles by nonuniversity people, the following statistics about this issue are interesting: 1) four of the nine authors are in industry and one is in government; 2) four of the five papers have nonuniversity authors; 3) three of the five papers are from non-U.S. authors."
"The findings of a study made of 39 successful entrepreneurs involved in the establishment of one or more technologically based enterprises in the secondary manufacturing sector in Canada are presented. Most of these enterprises are small, with a present annual sales volume of less than one million dollars. A major purpose of the study was to examine the social and economic background of the entrepreneurs, the nature of the companies they started or with which they were involved, and their perception of the environment for entrepreneurship in Canada. Special emphasis is given to comparing Canadian-born with non-Canadian-born entrepreneurs. Where feasible, the findings of this study are compared with comparable studies conducted in the United States."
"The results of a survey of the behavioral science literature pertinent to the performance of scientists and engineers are presented. The manager desiring to make use of existing behavioral science findings to achieve specific results within his organization is provided with a guide to those items in the literature which provide relevant information."
"The concept of applying basic economic principles to minimize the life-cycle cost of product or system development is outlined. The costs and benefits of alternative programs during the design phase are considered and the economic impact of reliability, maintainability, and availability is included. The activities necessary to maintain a finished system are then considered and an approach for maximizing the return on the maintenance investment is outlined. The paper concludes with general comments on system deployment and some organizational considerations."
"The result of an earlier investigation, that the efficiency of research teams increases with team size, has been verified by extending the investigation to further samples. The increase is exponential with team size and amounts to about a threefold increase in productivity per team member as the team is increased from 1 to 50 members. No optimum team size was found. Of two possible reasons for the increased efficiency of large teams, improved research environment (better service, better equipment, improved contacts with team members) and personal factors (improved selection of productive members) both have about equal weight. A preliminary study suggests that very productive team members' influence on other members is the dominating factor in the research environment; that is, that research effectiveness is induced by productive team leaders."
"A characterization is given about certain dynamic aspects of an existing organization which sells systems-engineering studies. A model built using Forrester's methodology, is reported, as well as simulations results. It is shown that a few large contracts should be preferred to many small ones, at least in the numerical case examined."

 "A POSSIBLY notable feature of the current issue is the review article about a potentially competitive journal — R&D Management — published in England. We welcome the competition for good articles (our competition for readership is, at present, not significant). When this TRANSACTIONS embarked on its “new” editorial policy in 1960 (see inside of back cover), it was the only refereed professional journal devoted entirely to analysis of the management of the research, development, and engineering (RD&E) process. Since its inception three years ago, R & D Management has helped fill a significant gap in the field, especially in Europe. As Alan Pearson mentions in his review article, our two journals have a high degree of complementarity and we are seeking ways of closer collaboration, since the problems of RD&E management are fairly universal. An opportunity to examine a copy is provided with the article, as well as an opportunity to subscribe. If members of the Engineering Management Group express sufficient interest, more direct ways can be explored to provide subscriptions as an adjunct of G-EM membership."
"How does technology originally created to meet the needs of one socioeconomic sector find application in an entirely different sector? In answering this question, a basis for interpreting and formulating federal policy related to the secondary utilization of publicly owned technology, has been provided. A model for explaining the intersectoral movement of new technology via two different and distinctive mechanisms-diffusion and transfer-is developed and then illustrated in this paper by case studies. This perspective builds on widely accepted views and unmasks the institutional characteristics which are the controlling influences for these mechanisms."
"Thirty-nine customer-initiated R&D projects were studied from the standpoint of those involved-salesmen, product engineers, R&D management, and R&D technical personnel. The technical and time success of the projects were correlated with six project dimensions as perceived by the R&D person working on the project, with participation and knowledge of product variables derived from management theory and with different communication patterns under differing conditions of project complexity. The results showed R&D perceptions of project priority and urgency to be correlated with time success and R&D perceptions of potential profitability to be correlated with technical success. The participation and knowledge of product variables showed no relation to project success."
"R&D evaluation methods and associated techniques are briefly reviewed. First, the use of checklists-ranging from a simple list of elements to a catalogue of profiles, or information patterns-is investigated. Then, some of the difficulties of interpretation and application of the deceptively simple index method-including consideration of the Olsen, Pacifico, Teal, and Disman formulas-are examined. This method is approached also from the return on original investment (ROOI) viewpoint and, by this means, several intriguing and unifying relationships, and certain new R&D indices are derived. Following a look at some indices of different type, some miscellaneous methods-including risk analysis, credibility forecast, decision tree, impact analysis, and one or two other techniques-are touched upon."
"It is generally recognized that practicing managers plan and take decisions by considering a few `key' factors in a given situation. However, this process of simplification can result in many different `decision models' and the question arises: which model is an `adequate and sufficient' representation of reality for the decision problem in hand. A methodology for comparing alternative mathematical models of a given strategic-planning problem, involving a well-defined interaction between the manager and the management scientist is presented. To illustrate, a specific problem of resource allocation in an applied research and development laboratory is defined, and the approach is illustrated using data from an industrial case study."
"A class of managerial problems which involves forecasting, developing new solutions, and maintaining harmony among individuals or groups affected by the solution is discussed. This type of problem is thought to occur frequently in organizations. A structure for solving such problems is proposed which is based upon combining the Delphi method of forecasting and the morphological method of inventing. The case history of the development of a college curriculum is cited as an example of successful use of the new method."

"There has been an upsurge of discussion recently about the status of engineering as a profession, the obligations of the engineer toward the public, and the relationship of the engineer to his employer. Some very important facets of these questions are illuminated by the fate of three engineers employed by BART. (Bay Area Rapid Transit)."
"Evolutions and revolutions in computer technology may affect society either on a global scale (management of the economy, law enforcement, etc.) or on a local scale (privacy of the individual, home computers, wired cities, credit ratings, etc.) or both. The 103 sessions comprising the 1973 National Computer Conference (NCC) dealt in part with these issues. Papers presented at three of the sessions are reviewed below. The written papers appear in the Conference Proceedings."
"The National Science Foundation (NSF), in an attempt to respond to the \"mounting interest throughout our society in the ethical and human value implications of science and technology,\" has appointed the one-time counterinsurgency task force chief for Southeast Asia under the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, Charles Maechling, Jr., to head up a new program in ethics."
"The European Conference on Electrotechnics, EUROCON'74 is devoted to the general theme: The Engineer and Society. It will be held in the R.A.I. Congress Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, during the period April 22–26, 1974. The meeting is organized by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Region 8 and by the Convention of National Societies of Engineers in Western Europe. The official language of the Conference will be English."
"CSIT was formed in response to a petition, signed by some six hundred members of IEEE who felt concern about the social implications of their professional work. During the past year the committee has initiated a number of activities, hopefully responding in some measure to the desires of the petitioners. In order to learn more specifically what socio-technical areas are of interest, a questionnaire was circulated in the first CSIT Newsletter and in other communications. So far 74 questionnaires have been returned and a number of other IEEE members have attended committee meetings, the INTERCON'73 forums or otherwise indicated their interest in becoming personally involved."

"Mr. A. D. Robbi whose affiliation was not given,∗ wrote a piece called \"Whither INTERCON?\" in the last issue of the CSIT Newsletter. In it he expressed concern that INTERCON, on its present course, would overemphasize the business aspects of electronics at the expense of social implications. As Exposition Director for the 1974 INTERCON, I would like to address myself to that subject."
"Editor's Note: A Conference on \"Scientists in the Public Interest: The Role of Professional Societies\", was held at Alta, Utah, September 7–9, 1973. Reports by task forces in the areas of public interest science information, defending professional responsibility, congressional fellows, public interest science study program, and the role of professional societies in improving science advising, were presented and resolutions were adopted. The symopsis of the report of the task force on defending professional responsibility and the companion resolution adopted by the conference are presented below. The American Chemical Society Legal Aid Loan Program is also presented. Information on the other areas mentioned above will be published in future issues of this Newsletter."
"An important function of an engineering society should be to encourage engineers to act ethically ih their work. However, in many cases, the employee engineer finds that such action will bring him into conflict with his employer. He is then faced with the possibility of severe reprisals that may extend as far as summary discharge and even blacklisting; a flagrant example of this is the BART case1. Such discharge, bad enough in itself, becomes even more serious where the loss of substantial accumulated pension credits may also be involved."
"One common difficulty with assessing the worth of a (usually non-standard) technique is how to judge the costs of the technique. Unfortunately, short-range, narrow economic notions are predominantly used. This often destroys an idea before it is given a fair forum."
"Organized by Michael Miller — executive director of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation — this session turned out to be the most controversial of the four meetings on Medical Electronics presented at WESCON 73. The roles of Government and the private sector in standard setting were discussed by Dr. H. Ley and the methodology for the standard setting was outlined by FDA spokesman Bob Cangelosi. A look at standards from industry's point of view was introduced by Mort Levin from Hewlett-Packard. To wrap up, Dr. Miller made his presentation on the legal implications of the new standards to become effective once Senate Bill S 2368 (Kennedy-Rogers) is enacted into law."

"Since the development of the transistor 25 years ago, the digital computer has changed greatly in size, speed, capability and cost. During the same period of time, clinical medicine has also progressed. Cardiac surgery has become commonplace, preventive medicine and mass health screening are gaining in popularity, and diagnostic tests such as the electrocardiogram and the chemical analysis of blood and urine are being carried out in ever increasing numbers. These are just a few of the many advances in medical science which have greatly increased the quantity of information that must be collected, sorted, analyzed, indexed, stored and otherwise manipulated."
"The transferral process of research to patient care is the most difficult and time consuming procedure known to physicians. The electrocardiogram was discovered in 1887, put into experimental Use in Europe in the early 1900's and in the United States 10 or so years later. But, it was not until the '20s and '30s that the electrocardiogram came into wide general use. Do we face a repetition of similar delays for electrocardiographic automation?"
"Multiphasic health testing programs using computers are becoming generally accepted in the United States. They have developed as a result of the increasing demand by the public for low-cost periodic health examinations and the availability of automated multiphasic health testing procedures and computerized data processing."
"The application of technology and system engineering techniques to the delivery of health services has made possible the successful implementation of a computer-based system in the clinical care of patients during the crucial early hours following heart surgery. Our hospital was faced with continually increasing numbers of candidates for cardiac operations without proportionate growth in the availability of skilled, highly motivated registered nurses qualified to care for these critically ill patients. Cardiac surgeons responsible for the patient's welfare hypothesized that despite greater patient loads the quality of care could be maintained, economically, with the existing nursing staff, if automation could be successfully employed to aid the physicians and the nurses with their care-related duties. In this paper we describe the results of integrating the computer into the day-to-day operation of the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit of the University of Alabama Hospital. Since July of 1967 this automated care system has performed record keeping duties and been used clinically in the observation and treatment of 2750 patients (2–28–73) following operation for correction of various acquired and congenital heart defects."

"The newly created Simulation Technical Committee held its organizational meeting at COMPCON 73. The major topics discussed at the meeting were a definition of the committee's charter and tentative plans for the coming years."
"The purpose of the workshop, held January 18–19, 1973, — to bring together persons from the two rather disjoint disciplines of Computer Architecture and Design and Implementation of Operating Systems — was achieved. It is fair to say that no more than one-half of the (62) attendees were known to any other attendee prior to the workshop. This is most uncommon for a workshop environment which usually consists of a group of close professional associates getting together to discuss common problems. There was also a good balance between representatives of the academic and industrial spheres."
"The recently-concluded 7th IEEE Computer Society International Conference, COMPCON 73, at the Jack Tar Hotel in San Francisco was “in all respects the most successful such gathering of computer professionals in history,” according to Rex Rice, permanent COMPCON Chairman who is Director of Technology for Fairchild Camera & Instrument Corporation."

"In this paper we attempt to define some of Jewel's needs for data collection and data communications and some of our approaches to satisfying these needs. In order to make this discussion meaningful, we first describe the company to the extent necessary to make our applications understandable. Then we discuss our data processing applications to indicate how we have solved some difficult problems."
"State-of-the-art design of communication networks is characterized by the ubiquitous appearance of computer technology. All significant message-switching systems designed in the last ten years have used stored program processor controlled switching. Sophisticated terminals are also using small computers, and are otherwise dominated by the use of digital electronics. The telecommunications technological environment is characterized by rapidly changing cost-benefit relationships among system components, due primarily to the cost decline of digital logic."
"The widespread use of minicomputers in widely diverse applications has resulted in the need for many peripheral devices to allow user communication with the machine. Data passing from the computer to the operator may be in the form of paper tape, punch cards, line printer listing, voice output, and video display to name but a few. Many applications require that the computer output be in a “hard copy” form such as a line printer listing. Obvious examples include such areas as order processing, invoice preparation, and payroll distribution."

"American and Russian Delegates for the IEEE/Popov Exchange met at a party at the Americana Hotel in New York on March 26. This year the theme of the Exchange is Computer Science and Technology."
"There are numerous indications that the field of Artificial intelligence (AI) is now well established: a specialized journal is entering its third year of publication; the third major biennial conference organized by an ad hoc international council will be held in August; several textbooks and paper collections have been published, and several Computer Science Departments have AI specialties; and some important disciplines whose roots are in AI, such as Pattern Recognition and Symbolic Algebraic Manipulation, have already spun off as independent areas. Still, when I identify my field as Artificial intelligence, I frequently am met by blank stares, snickers, or questions concerning whether that means building simulated rats or planting false military rumors. I hope this issue of COMPUTER will clear up some of the confusion."
"A major theme in artificial intelligence research has been the quest for methods for common-sense reasoning about actions and their effects. Such methods, when implemented as computer programs, are called automatic problem solvers, and are the subject of this papers."
"“Intelligent” computers require knowledge of their environment, and the most effective means of acquiring such knowledge is by seeing. Vision opens a new realm of computer applications. Weather analysis from cloud maps and medical diagnosis from x-rays and blood cell counts are two of many high volume data processing tasks that require pictorial input. Man-machine communication will be facilitated if a person can directly show the computer a real object, rather than describe it symbolically. Designers, for example, could then easily obtain a computerized structural analysis of scale models."
"One of the most active areas of Artificial Intelligence research today is the understanding of natural language. From the earliest days of computing, people have been intrigued by the idea of communicating easily with computers. In the past few years, new techniques and larger systems have combined to open new possibilities for expressing ideas to computers in natural language. Question answering systems are approaching a level useful in real applications areas. Advanced computing applications like automatic programming will base their interaction with the user on natural language capabilities. In almost every area of computing, it is easy to imagine ways in which language understanding could make computers more accessible, not only for those who use them now, but for a much wider range of people without special training."
"A number of companies announced new computer models in March; the five reviewed here fall in the range of high-capability mini to low capability G.P. Four of these new computers offer writeable microprogram memory; one (IBM's) is a system which includes several brand new peripherals as well as a new processor."

"IEEE Computer Society membership application."
"Recent editorials and interviews with IEEE Computer Society President Albert S. Hoagland in COMPUTER have served to emphasize certain points of view that I believe are at variance with what most other IEEE members intend for their organization. Although the membership of the IEEE voted to change its constitution to permit professional activities in addition to scientific and educational activities, there was little doubt in anyone's mind that the emphasis of the IEEE was to remain on its scientific, educational, and literary excellence."
"Dr. A.S. Hoagland, President of the IEEE Computer Society, presented Honor Roll certificates to several outstanding members of the Society at the National Computer Conference held June 4–8 at the New York Coliseum.

"Since its commercial introduction in 1965, the minicomputer has revolutionized data processing. Its compact size and low cost have permitted the development of dedicated systems to meet specialized data processing requirements ranging from communications control, instrument data acquisition, and small business accounting to hotel reservations management and operating racetrack tote boards."
"On January 22, 1973, IBM announced the 3740 Data Entry System and in so doing took a step that will strongly impact the entire data processing industry. What makes the 3740 so unusual is that it employs a new data storage medium — a flexible disk or, as IBM calls it, a “Diskette” — for an application heretofore dominated by punched cards. It is clear from statements in the IBM announcement that IBM expects the Diskette to replace the punched card as the major data entry medium and the 3740 System to replace keypunches, key-to-tape units, and off-line clustered key-tape and key-disk systems."
"The IEEE Computer Elements Spring Workshop was in session February 25, 26, 1973 at San Francisco, California. Two regular sessions were developed to highlight the theme of the workshop, which was “Calculators to Mini's.”"
"A Minicomputer Symposium sponsored by the National Bureau of Standards and the IEEE Computer Society was held in April at the NBS Gaithersburg, Md. facilities. This wellattended symposium brought together users and suppliers of minicomputers and minicomputer services to arrive at a better understanding of the potential of minis and to identify issues in need of attention."
"The COSINE Committee of the Commission on Education of the National Academy of Engineering was organized in September, 1965 to help electrical engineering departments develop educational programs in computer engineering and to redesign other courses to use digital computers. The COSINE Committee disbanded in late 1972. A final activity of the COSINE Committee was an evaluation of the growth of computer engineering in electrical engineering departments during the last seven years and of the impact of COSINE Committee activities. The evaluation was accomplished through a questionnaire survey of electrical engineering department chairmen. This paper reports the results of that survey∗."

"Much of our attention has been focussed recently on our relations with the IEEE. However, significant events are taking place among the professional societies that represent the computer industry. We must deal with these events, and the way we deal with them could have a great impact on the future stature and role of our Society."
"The following slate of nominees to the Governing Board of the IEEE Computer Society will be presented on November 16, 1973 at the Governing Board meeting to be held at the Happy Dolphin Inn, St. Petersburg Beach, Florida, during the Third Data Communications Conference."
"This is an important time in the history of modular computer systems. The first generation has been developed and its products are in daily use; now the developers of modular computer systems are taking the first steps toward the second generation. The first generation systems started with the fixed-plus-variable computer system proposed by Estrin in 19601, progressed through the developments of macromodules and Register Transfer Modules, and have reached a point of proliferation with the development of systems at MIT, the University of Delaware, and the University of Washington. (A brief description of these systems, with references, is contained in the paper by Fuller and Siewiorek.) It seems that the second generation systems will be characterized by an attempt to incorporate the developments of large scale integrated circuits and the “computer-on-a-chip” into modular systems."
"Modules for computer system design are becoming increasingly complex, driven by decreasing cost and size of hardware and increasing computer system performance requirements. Standard modules have evolved from circuit elements to gates and flip-flops to integrated-circuit chips to register-transfer level module sets. Because of the continuing development of semiconductor technology, LSI components — e.g., memory chips with ≥ 1K bits and microprocessors — may become the standard components of digital design. Are these memory arrays and microprocessors the right set of large modules to use in the next generation of digital system design? To discuss this and related questions, a workshop on the architecture and application of digital modules was held on June 7–8, 1973, at Carnegie-Mellon University. To ensure as wide a range of perspectives as possible, participants were invited from computer manufacturers, semiconductor manufacturers, and universities."
"Unlike the other modules described in this issue, Register Transfer Modules (RTM's)∗∗ have been produced and marketed commercially (by Digital Equipment Corporation). This gives RTM's an interest all their own; it is one thing to conceive of a set of register transfer level digital modules, but quite another to market them."
"During the past two years, members of the Computer Systems Laboratory and visitors have been designing and constructing computer systems which use restructurable computer building blocks called macromodules.1,2 Conceived and developed to permit convenient experimentation with computer systems, macromodules consist of a set of easily interconnected modules from which working systems can rapidly be assembled. The modules are functionally rich enough to reduce logical detail by a significant amount, and a collection of modules may be directly combined to form larger structures by straightforward mechanical assembly and easily connected cables."
"A new logic State Analyzer (Model 1601L) that tests logic circuitry has been introduced by Hewlett-Packard. It collects data on the fly, at rates up to 10 megabits/second, from as many as twelve parallel lines, and presents the data on a CRT as sixteen consecutive 12-bit binary words. The information is stored in shift registers and can be displayed indefinitely. Triggering options are so various that the instrument can easily be made to access virtually any desired sequence in the data stream. Triggering occurs, in clock synchronism, when data matches any chosen preset word, in any format. The trigger can start the display, stop it to show what happened before the trigger, or start a counter to delay the display by any preset number of clock cycles (up to 99,999) after trigger word occurs. A new probe system yields better ways to probe typical close-packed logic circuitry. New probes are small enough for side-by-side connection on a DIP."

 "“The law is very much concerned with continuity and predictability; consequently it inevitably seeks to draw analogies between a new innovation and existing doctrine.”"
"The movement toward a cashless society is by no means a new phenomenon. The introduction, in the 1860's, of checks into the monetary system of the United States initiated the transformation of the American monetary system from a “cash-based” community to a cashless society. In fact, it has been estimated recently that over 90% of the total dollar volume of payments made in the United States are made by check.1 Nevertheless, checks, which require multiple handling by banks, are inherently inefficient payment instruments. This inefficiency, combined with the seven percent annual increase in volume of checks processed in the United States,2 threatens the fundamental operations of our payments system. While recent operational developments, such as the introduction of magnetic ink character recognition techniques, provide short-term solutions, there is some question whether the present check-processing system can be sustained in an operationally sound condition beyond the present decade."
"The nature and extent of legal protection available for computer programs is somewhat uncertain because of their abstract nature. The law has historically been willing to recognize rights in concrete objects such as real estate and tangible personal property. Where disputes arise as to rights to such tangible objects, the courts can define the subject of the dispute and give a judgment which is certain, at least as to the object affected, if not the rights of the contesting parties."

 "At the Last Fall Joint a year ago I took in the session on Historical Perspectives, and baited panelist Walter Bauer by suggesting that the invention of interrupts was one of the greatest disasters in the history of computer development. (But then he had just piqued me by saying that our present software difficulties are not going to get any better any time soon, and that nothing we computer architects can do will help much.) I'd like to pursue this subject a little further in these pages and try to drag some more of you into the debate (on my side, of course)."
"In the late 1960's, not many people had direct experience in designing or working with supercomputers, but at least there was little confusion over what the term “supercomputer” meant. In those days the main criterion for qualifying as a supercomputer was the number of instructions handled per unit time. Today, we know a good deal more about this category of machine, but it's getting harder and harder to define the term — mainly because of its growth in number and variety. The proliferation of processors has created a need for an orderly, workable scheme of classifications."

 "I welcome the opportunity to address the members of the Computer Society in COMPUTER — particularly since I was not given the opportunity to do this in SPECTRUM. When I learned that the Regional Directors had been asked to make a statement on the referendum in the September issue of SPECTRUM I felt that the cards were being stacked somewhat by the anti-referendum forces. Therefore, I requested space for a message as the Director of Division 5 but was told that it was past the deadline — despite the fact that statements were still being accepted from Regional Directors."

"The nature, scope, architecture and cost of the memory system used by digital computers for storage and retrieval of information has undergone dynamic changes during the last few years."
"Two of the major factors affecting the efficiency of a computing system are the Data Transfer Rate between processor(s) and main memory and the Availability of Data in main memory as needed by the processor(s). The objective of this paper is to present some of the techniques employed in order to enhance the effectiveness of these factors. Both factors are dependent upon the cycle time of the main memory and the memory management system. Furthermore, in the case of multiprocessing environments, one other architectural feature of the main memory arrangement that becomes equally important to data transfer rates and availability is the concept of Modular Memory Organization where the memory is organized into a number of independent memory modules that can be accessed independently by individual processors."
"The need for mass storage in computer systems is becoming increasingly important with the growing trend toward interactive terminal-oriented systems storing all data on-line under systems control. The capacity required of mass-storage devices (disk, tape, and card), therefore, far exceeds the range for which electronic memory is economical."
"The dominant factors involved in a comparison of memory component technologies depend somewhat on the storage capacity required in a single independently accessable module. Here we make a distinction between small memories and large memories, with the dividing line taken at 104 bits, and between large memories and file or archive memories with a division at about 108 bits."
"A truly low-cost, general purpose CRT terminal has been announced by TEC, Incorporated.

"DPMA Study Committee Recommends Further Exploration of AFIPS Membership Proposal"
"Historically, the interaction between operating systems and computer architecture has largely been very one-directional. Only recently have engineers begun to more fully appreciate that traditional hardware cost-performance tradeoffs are not entirely appropriate for stored-program machines. The operating system may be the most complex program ever written for the machine, as well as the one most frequently run. Yet, with a few notable exceptions, computer hardware is still not being designed with sufficient regard for the special requirements of supervisory software. Systems programmers are usually faced with creating operating systems which will survive and flourish in architectural environments ranging from passive to inhospitable. As with Samuel Johnson's upright dog, the surprise is not that it's done well, but that it's done at all."
"The organizers of the Workshop on the Interaction of Operating Systems and Computer Architecture were motivated by two principal considerations: 1) call the attention of hardware designers to the growing maturity of the study of resource and process control algorithms; and 2) cause software system designers and implementers to focus on the developing trends and capabilities in computer architecture, and on the possibility of moving significant portions of operating systems to firmware/hardware."
"IBM System/360 I/O architecture was designed at a time when relatively little was known about structured programming and hierarchically constructed operating systems. These techniques have been used in an operating systems project begun some 2–1/2 years ago in Canada to implement an I/O Supervisor which models the hierarchy present in the I/O hardware. The interfaces between the various software modules suggest improvements to the System/360/370 I/O architecture, which are made feasible by current microprocessor technologies."
"Computer designers and users have felt the need for monitoring the behavior of their systems since the earliest days of the computer era. However, only very few and recent systems have been adequately instrumented by their designers during the design stage (see for example reference 1). This situation has led to the development of hardware and software measurement tools having the common property of requiring relatively minor or no modifications of the system to be monitored. The applicability of these tools in certain measurement problems is somewhat limited, since on one hand the system was not specifically designed to be measurable, and on the other hand the tool was designed to be applicable to a class of systems, configurations, or versions, and its measurement power with respect to a particular system may have been sacrificed to its generality."
"Much of the current programming effort for conventional computers is spent in planning the allocation of primary and secondary memory during the execution of a program. Virtual memory systems were introduced in order to free the programmer from much of the time-consuming and routine work associated with memory management. However, when a program requires more memory locations than are available in a particular virtual memory, the virtual memory must be managed by using virtual access methods. For these applications, the virtual memory advantage of increased programmer productivity is sharply reduced."

"This special issue of COMPUTER explores computer networks — their technology, politics, and management. A computer network is an interconnected set of dependent or independent computer systems which communicate with each other in order to share certain resources such as programs or data — and/or for load sharing and reliability reasons. Rapid growth in the number of computers and the availability of broadband communications facilities makes computer networks feasible, and perhaps economically desirable."
"The importance of computer networking as a powerful national force is now being recognized both in the public and private sectors1. The necessary computer and communications technologies are rapidly evolving and, while a large number of networks are fully operational, there is extensive continuing research and development underway that promises greater efficiencies and capabilities than those realized on a wide scale today."
"Computer networks and their communications support no longer present major technical problems. Today, many organizations are planning major networks in a very matter-of-fact way; often, however, giving little or no consideration to non-technical issues during the design phase. When operational networks are being designed, full consideration must be given to the legal, economic, social, and management factors as well as those that are purely technical."
"Technical feasibility of computer-communication networks has already been demonstrated [3, 5, 8, 14] for general purpose computers, and evidence is currently being presented to show that economic viability is also feasible. [8, 14]"
"In the past, digital processors were designed with gates and flip-flops. Then along came read only memories (ROMS) which enabled the designer to program logic in memory, thus simplifying system design. And now, National Semiconductor Corporation has gone one step further with the Programmable Logic Array (PLA)."

"A speaker conveys information not only by pronouncing words; he also uses pitch, inflection, and varying amplitude. The writer conveys information using printed letters concatenated to make words, these, in turn made into sentences. He has available similar mechanisms to supplement his written communication but rarely uses them: he can use different type faces; he can lay out the information upon the page in different fashions; he can vary the size of the printed material. Only the last, the use of different type faces to supplement communication is examined here, with examples from books which teach computer science. The salient feature of multiple type faces is that they increase intelligibility with no diminution in the information transmitted."

"It is the author's thesis that more battles have been lost because of misunderstood orders than because of the failure of strategy, tactics or logistics; that the most important tool of the manager is not the computer, the high speed copier, the automatic voice network and other devices about which there is so much concern, but the language itself which, almost unnoticed, continues to disintegrate at an ever faster rate. The importance of language on communication is discussed."
"An explanation of differences of individuals in engineering communications skills places common problems in several psychological contexts. Individual and corporate personality types are examined along with standard approaches to improving communications. Group communication patterns are analyzed and systematic techniques are presented which add behavioural psychological considerations to the mechanics of generating valuable communications."
"A historical approach to the study of the development of style manuals for book publishers and writers is undertaken. Guides of the ancient world are discussed and compared with the most widely used of today's manuals. Included is an evaluation of the changes that have occurred during this century. A shift from the publisher-oriented style manual to those with a greater concern for the needs and guidance of the author is seen. Today's spirit of cooperation appears to dominate the manuals that are now being published. The value of style manuals as a factor in helping to limit the ever-increasing costs in publishing is discussed and suggestions for improvement of format are presented."
 "Among the many text-books, guide-books, case-books, and hand-books now available on technical writing, three small and unpretentious volumes deserve particular attention. All three are instructive, persuasive, and pleasant. One is an old friend, long known as the little book; the other two, very much younger, are works of high quality also:"

 "The conference represented by this Record was remarkable in at least two respects. It brought together editors and publishers from engineering and the engineering-related sciences on one hand, and those from the biological and social sciences on the other. It also joined in discussion the editors and publishers on one hand, and the users — librarians and information scientists — on the other. The informal exchanges alone resulting from these unusual encounters was enough to justify the conference for many of those who attended."
"The final session of the 1973 IEEE Conference on the Future of Scientific and Technical Journals was recorded in its entirety; both the Summary that follows and the open discussion included at the end of this Record are based on that recording. This Summary of the first four sessions of the Conference was compiled and edited by A. F. Spilhaus, Jr., Chairman of Session V, from the summaries of the individual sessions delivered at the Conference by the session chairmen or their designates, and will introduce the reader to the Conference by establishing a framework within which each of the subsequent papers can be placed."
"Objective of a professional technical journal for an audience interested in a field where both mathematical theory and practical developments are of interest are discussed along with some of the general problems and possible procedures involved in obtaining, evaluating, and selecting appropriate papers for publication. Although editorial management of journals for a specific field of interest is emphasized, many of the principles involved should be generally applicable. Some of these certain to prrmanent of material; record keeping; obligations to authors, associate editors, and readers; obtaining meaningful reviews; and criteria for acceptance or rejection of papers."
"To survive, technical journals must continuously attract readers. The author is primarily concerned with the accuracy and validity of any statement about his work. Only the editor can act as the advocate of the readers, making sure that the author's message will be at all times understandable. This paper explores methods of working with authors on the readers' behalf. The editor, in his first contact with the author, must establish a climate of cooperation and inspire confidence. a booklet of author's aids is often useful in the joint planning of an outline. By identifying one or two first principles which can serve to initiate a reader who is unfamiliar with the subject — and then developing a logical sequence of ideas, the author can make a firm start towards a more successful draft. Proper editorial management and systematic planning of communication between editor and author can improve readability and thus sustain the interest of present readers while attracting others."
"Journals covering a broad field of specialties face a period of weeding out. This process will bring to the fore the journals which demonstrate a better understanding of the needs of readers. Journals that survive will in all likelihood be those which see their role as making understandable to readers a significant selection of the insights of specialists: To fulfill this mission, the editor will need to have the appetite and the ability to continue learning; he must have the interpersonal skills to make effective use of a board of expert advisers; and he must wage a tireless campaign for all the elements of good communication. For the multispecialist technical journal, these are the dimensions of survival. The format of the surviving journals will emphasize refinement of the mature communications techniques, at least for the next 10 or 15 years. Few, if any, of today's journals exploit the full scope of good writing and editing, functional drawings, photography, typography, page design, and offset printing."
"Primary journals in their present form cannot survive because of the forthcoming overwhelming increase in technical information. Future indexing, storage, and retrieval of technical papers will have to be done through specialized multidisciplinary international organizations with the cooperation and support of the advanced and developing countries of the world. A scheme is proposed for greatly reducing publication delays as well as the costs of publication, storage, and retrieval of technical papers in the future."
"Most scientific journals are characterized by relatively low circulation (often fewer than 5000 subscribers) and relatively high price ($20 and above per year is not uncommon). In some scientific fields, however, there is a sufficiently well developed market for products that advertising income becomes a more than significant potential source of revenue. In such cases, it is financially possible to produce technical publications that are both inexpensive to purchase (less than $10 annual subscription) and that have large circulations (sometimes 30 000 or more paid subscribers). Such publications — technical magazine/journal hybrids — have a number of advantages, chief among which is the opportunity to give subscribers a great deal more for their money, but they also present difficulties for the publisher. Among these difficulties are the unpredictable nature of advertising support and the consequent difficulties in budgeting, the need to maintain high circulation, and the editorial challenges inherent in serving a large and possibly heterogeneous readership. These points will be illustrated with references to two American Chemical Society publications that are “hybrid” in nature, Analytical Chemistry and Environmental Science and Technology."
"The information needs of journal users are normally complex. They need specific, discipline-oriented information and also more general, mission-oriented information. The journals are expected to provide items required for current awareness as well as data of an archival nature. As a consequence, decisions concerning the subject coverage, formats, and packaging of journals are also complex, particularly in view of the impact of these decisions on the economics of journal publication. The factors involved are presented and their effect upon the future of primary journals is considered."
"THE large audience assembled for this symposium testifies to the importance of scientific and technical journals. It also testifies to the fact that many people are beginning to feel that past and present practices with respect to the journals must change. I will touch briefly on five factors that will have a role in the coming evolution-moneys libraries, readers, authors, and reviewers."
"Rapidly rising costs for printing and distribution are placing increased pressure on the publication operations of scientific societies to reassess support from traditional revenue sources. The outlook for page charges, advertising, reprint sales, back-issue sales, subscriptions, and membership does support will be discussed. The American Chemical Society owns and manages 17 research-oriented publications with a combined circulation of 175 000. The variety of publications, review journals, pure research journals, engineering journals, and magazines, affords an opportunity to encounter most of the problems associated with publishing scientific materials."
"Expansion of typewriter composition and the shift from letter press to sheet-fed offset and web-offset printing are two major developments that are lowering costs and improving the efficiency of the overall publishing operation at the American Institute of Physics (AIP). In 1972, out of a total of 104 000 text pages published by AIP and its member societies, about 69 000 pages, or 66 percent, were typewriter composed. Typewriter composition of scientific articles was pioneered by S. A. Goudsmit, Editor-in-Chief of the American Physical Society, for Physical Review Letters. This weekly publication has been typewriter composed since 1958. Today, about 11 000 pages for Physical Review C and Physical Review D are typewriter composed at AIP's new publishing facility at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Another 8000 pages mainly for Applied Physics Letters and the Journal of Applied Physics are produced by our Publications Division Composition Section in New York City. A small fraction of the total is composed to AIP specifications by the authors themselves. Outside contractors handle the remaining typewriter composition including all of the Russian translation journals. The main justification for the switch from monotype to typewriter composition is the resulting savings of 20 to 30 percent in composition cost Depending upon the journal and the compositor used, these savings amount to as much as $10 per page. In addition, the close coupling of copy editing, composition, proofreading, and page makeup that is possible with an in-house typewriter composition operation has shortened publication time by as much as 2 weeks out of a total of 3 months. We will describe the AIP typewriter composition system from copy editing, through the composition of galleys, to page makeup and the production of final camera-ready copy for offset printing. Specially modified IBM Executive proportional-spacing electric typewriters, equipped with unique attachments, permit the use of a wide range of special characters and signs (italic, Greek, mathematical symbols, superscripts, etc.) needed to compose scientific articles."
"The increasing availability of microfilm editions of journals in libraries throughout the world provides publishers with opportunities to reassess the traditional role of the journal in filling a wide spectrum of user needs. Publishers can now select media options which more precisely fit the needs of users and which result in significant cost reduction as well as producing additional revenues. For the American Chemical Society (ACS), the revenues produced are developed from the sale of the microfilm version of its back and current volume and from a photocopying license fee included in the pricing structure. With microfilm versions of journals becoming more widely available, editors and authors are encouraged to put material into the microfilm edition that might otherwise have been carried in the printed version. Every such transfer of a page is a saving of $60 to $100 per page less any page-charge revenue, it is possible to more sharply reduce the printed pages in a journal by moving toward the digest or short-paper concept. The savings in production costs could affect the whole pattern of pricing and lead to the elimination of page charges and to lower prices for individual users of the short form or digest journal."
"Although computer technology has been introduced into virtually every phase of scientific communication, relatively little use has yet been made of it in primary dissemination, perhaps because of the limited operational scale of the typical scientific publisher. An Editorial Processing Center (EPC) is conceived as a mechanism for combining small publishing operations to achieve a scale great enough for significant computerization while leaving each editor in full command of his own publication. The EPC's computer assists authors, editors, and referees to perform their essential, intellectual functions by relieving them of nonessential, programmable functions. Its final output is a magnetic tape for use in photocomposition. Its potential benefits include immediate operating economies, more effective communication, a base for innovation in the form of publication, and benefits to secondary processors and analysis centers. A number of questions remain, however, chiefly in relation to the exact operating point at which any given configuration would become economically advantageous. Work is in progress to provide the answers."
"The American Institute of Physics (AIP), as an essential aspect of its Current Physics Information (CPI) program, has been implementing a new procedure for the production of both its primary journals and its secondary-information products which relies on a singe processing of the common elements in both. This processing includes copy editing, keyboarding, proofreading, and indexing of such items as article titles, authors, by-lines, abstracts, and references. The single computer tape produced by this processing is used for the photocomposition of the elements involved for the primary journals, as well as for AIP's secondary services including the volume indexes to the primary journals themselves. I will discuss the reasons for this change in procedure, and its technical and economic aspects. I will also sketch out possible future developments in the system, which would rely on much greater use of computer processing, and attempt to assess the economic benefits. Finally, I will discuss the effects of AIP's secondary-information capabilities on the dissemination of primary information in traditional formats, as well as possible alternative formats."
"Using a computer text processing system as the entry and change vehicle for a photocomposition system affects the publishing function in many ways. Costs are reduced, quality and readability are enhanced, esthetics are more controllable, and entry personnel require little training. Proofreading is almost entirely replaced by a computer-generated concordance. Mechanicals for reproduction are completed at the editor's site, not at the printer's, completing one more step in the movement to the automated office. The Honeywell Computer Journal is published concurrently on hard copy, microfiche, and magnetic tape. The tape can be used to drive other photocomposition systems that differ from our own, just as a computer can translate COBOL programs to the running instructions of a particular computer. Thus our work has shown the way to a common composition language that can describe all formats and identify uniquely the universe of printed symbols."
"Two purported “answers” to the proems some people are now experiencing in the dissemination of engineering information are distinguished. These are called “synoptic declension” and “electronic expansion.” Detailed versions proposed under these headings are examined and compared with the proven advantages of the engineering transactions. It is concluded that there is no viable alternative in the English-speaking world to the engineering transactions. However, certain areas where the transactions could be improved are pointed out. Reference is made to the present plight of the engineering journal, by which is meant the journal that passes across the engineer's desk and is read, not the periodical that goes straight on to the shelves for reference. It is conducted that Industry must recognize its overall interest in the future of the engineering journal and take steps to ensure its continued viability."
"The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) has conducted experiments with Selective Dissemination of Documents (SDD), Synoptics, and Miniprints. In 1967 a 500-member test group responded favorably to a biweekly hard-copy SDD system comprising preprints and journal items in their selected topics. However, a proposed follow-on program languished for lack of funds: an analysis in 1971 indicated that the documents from AIAA alone would be too few for a viable SDD system, and a survey in 1972 showed that interest in SDD had declined. Therefore, the AIAA is no longer actively pursuing SDD. A Synoptic is a 2-journal-page presentation of the key results of a work in directly usable form (including selected tables and/or figures), backed by a full paper that is available on request at cost. Synoptics now replace about 25 percent of the full papers in AIAA journals, with reasonable success in respect to quality (the communication goal) and acceptance by all concerned, but few members would approve their in place of all full papers. Miniprints prepared by photoreducing author-prepared copy to half-size could save much money and shelf space. But minorities opposed them so strongly that this idea was shelved. Other questions on journal scopes, composition, and review procedures are also discussed."
"Regular journal publication becomes less effective as specialties become narrower and reader interest spans a broader range of subjects. Journals also are subject to some time delays due to their periodic publishing schedules. Publication of separate articles can overcome these problems, but in turn require strong information retrieval system support, a method of establishing a good technical profile of readers, an author recognition system that gives equivalent credit to being published in a journal, and a strong marketing department. If separate publications are properly designed, they can be self-supporting, without page charges, in technical areas that are not practical for journal publication. Separates can also automatically operate in regular journal areas. A valuable by-product of separate publications is an automatic tally of the people interested in or working on a specific technical project. Covered in the paper are the editorial, peer jury, production, distribution, and management systems associated with the Society of Automotive Engineer's method of primary publication in separate format."
"Production of journals on microfiche provides such radically new possibilities for both publishers and subscribers that it can reasonably be described as a publishing revolution. For the publisher, using microfiche rather that print makes possible significant cost savings for black and white periodicals with circulations up to at least 50 000. It is even economically feasible to produce microfiche publications in full color. For many journals, the savings are so great that distribution can be by first-class mail, thus bypassing second-class mailing regulations and increasing the speed and reliability of distribution. If publishers pass along these savings to subscribers, the latter benefit from lower subscription costs. Although some individual subscribers will have to purchase microfiche readers, the low cost of a reader (approximately half that of an office typewriter) suggests they will be willing to make this investment. Most advantaged by microfiche publishing are libraries; they benefit not only from reduced subscription costs but also from elimination of the need for binding and for finding shelf space for bound volumes. The present predicament of scholarly libraries is so serious and the economic advantages of microfiche publishing are so great that libraries may exert a backward pressure on publishers to force them to use microfiche, whether they want to or not."
"During the past 30 years the technical report has developed into an important primary medium of communication in science and technology, to the extent that it is sometimes seen as a threat to primary journal publication. At the same time the (unclassified) report has been accused of not meeting the same standards of authority, scientific rigor, and retrievability as conventional journal publication. Report publication is reviewed in the light of standards commonly accepted for journal publication, and the inherent characteristics of technical reports are assessed. It is concluded that both reports and scientific journals have distinct roles to play in the communication of scientific and technical information, and that a cost-effective system will make full use of the strengths of both."
"The primary goal of science is the discovery of knowledge and scientific innovation. Such newly acquired information must be disseminated to many different groups of researchers who have many different interests and specific needs. Identifying existing markets for present information poses formidable problems for information scientists; anticipating future scientific breakthroughs and the potential impact thereof is an even greater challenge. On the one side of the scientific market exchange system, practitioners, researchers, and scholars seek information quickly and accurately and at a reasonable price. On the other side, a science of information systems has developed using new media, retrieval, and dissemination techniques with different cost/utility structures. This paper discusses a relatively inexpensive technique, citation indexing, which has the advantage of being adaptable to any scientific discipline wherein the scientific journal is a primary means of communication. Although citation indexes are incomplete at any given point in time, they are “complete on the important issues” and can be adapted to many different research and institutional management purposes."
"THE scientific family appears to focus its aspirations, and perhaps thereby its inadequacies, in a number of ways. One of the salient aspirations is the desire for recognition by the lay as well as by the scientific community."
"Managers of research and development activities should recognize that they have a vital stake in the survival and health of professional journals in their present, future, or any form. The journals' functions in communicating informations, according achievments, and enhancing poor recognition are are well known. Perhaps less well understood, and certainly less well employed, is the fact that journals can be used by managers as a tool to measure “who's doing what, and how well.” This is not a version of “publish or perish,” but rather a test of the merit of the work being done. This paper discusses, from the point of view of technical management, specific points that make papers prepared for publication in professional journals useful for appraising the quality of work being done in the laboratory."
"“Scientific communication” is defined as the public display, by an individual scientist or small group of scientists to other scientists, of the results of recent research accomplished by the individual or small group, by means of papers published in scientific journals, delivered at conferences, or informally distributed among members of invisible colleges. A “social function” of scientific communication is defined as an effect of scientific communication on a scientific discipline or on one or more of its members. It is argued that the social functions of scientific communication grow out of three fundamental characteristics of science as a social enterprise: (1) science is a professional occupation; (2) science is a value-directed norm-governed social activity; and (3) science is a system of social exchange. The characteristics of scientific papers are examined in light of their social functions. It is suggested that these functions may be classified in three categories: (1) surveillance functions; (2) socialization functions; and (3) social control functions."
"Pressure on scientists to publish is having undesirable effects on the scientists themselves, their work, and their journals. Changing the nature of scientific journals might alleviate some of these effects."
"The use of emotionally laden words in the scientific literature, especially on controversial topics, tends to undermine objectivity. Readers begin to respond emotionally rather than rationally. To investigate this phenomenon on some systematic basis, we reviewed all the articles and letters published in two major medical journals in 1971 on the subject of commonly used psychoactive drugs, Many of these articles contained words used rhetorically rather than scientifically, which undoubtedly altered opinions or reinforced prejudices among many readers, words such as “alarming,” “abuse,” “addiction,” and “epidemic.” We believe that such rhetoric has no place in the scientific literature. It involves value judgments and not scientific evaluation, and as such concerns social and not scientific issues. We conclude, then, that authors must avoid language that persuades rather than explains. Moreover, editors must accept a special responsibility to prevent semantic abuses from creeping into their journals."
"This study was designed to assess the effects of delay in publication of information in medical journals. The case study concerned the natural history of an article that appeared recently in a medical journal. The particulars of this article from the time of its conception through its consecutive submission to, and rejection by, four major medical journals, and its eventual publication, instead, in a minor medical journal have been studied. The subject of the article was a new form of treatment for Amanita verna poisoning. The period of delay between clinical treatment and publication of the article was 21 months. During this period, however, information about this clinical case received general publicity through newspapers, magazine articles, radio, and telephone. These details then were considered in the context of the medical journal's traditional roler to communicate information that sometimes may be urgent. The effects of delays and breakdowns in the information system that links medical authors with medical readers by way of medical journals and the influence of other media on medical communication also have been considered. To remain effective as channels of communication in an information-conscious society, medical journals must reassess their traditional methods of transmitting information by becoming aware of faults in this specialized communication system and by ensuring that information that is primarily of medical interest does not, by default, have to be transmitted by other chanels."
"A model is proposed of the scientific journal as a specialized communication medium embedded in a highly unstructured communication process, its characteristics are found in its specialized process for continuously sampling, filtering, and converting the flow of ideas into a stable and visible form. Its the immediate (and long range) readership, and the purpose of the journal, which may range from current event reporting to archival, from theory to application, from tutorial to dialectic, and the like. A wide variety of both old and innovative techniques are presented which may be useful in making improvements, and especially in establishing and maintaining a shared view of function with both contributors and readers. Not only the editorial and content sections of the journal but also supplementary means, such as instructions to authors, are discussed."
"Walter Fraser (Rutgers University Graduate School of Library Service): It has seemed to me unfortunate during the Conference that there has been a “soak the library” atmosphere; it's distressing. Our revenues throughout the library system have not increased during this lime of exigency and there seems little possibility that they will. Libraries already in many instances pay a higher institutional rate for journals than members or the general public do. In addition, there's a great deal of discussion about adding on copyright permission charges or simply just raising the institutional rate. I heard at least three speakers who are editors say, “Well we've got higher costs, so we'll raise the institutional rate.” The obvious implications in that case will be some of the things mentioned by the chairman, Fred Spilhaus. If institutional rates continue to be raised, there's obviously going to be a shakeout of journals. I'm not terribly sure that that's an ultimate improvement. There are many operations of this society in which tests of the marketplace are valid. I'm not sure the test of the marketplace is valid in biology; it may be in chemistry where there's tremendous support from organizations within the society, from business, universities, and government. There are some fields where this may not be a valid criterion for deciding which journals should continue. The library purchases do constitute advertisement for the journal; they do constitute exposure of the student in the profession and the embryo professional to the journal. I just view with horror the attitude of “soak the libraries.”"
"“This book is different!” says a promotional leaflet of Cameraready, a bright blue, 1 1/2-inch, ring-bound manual which tells about the mechanics of producing special-use, limited-life documents in limited editions. And “Vive la difference!” cries this reviewer, who is enthusiastic about every aspect of the book except its price."
   "Presents the front cover for this issue of the publication."
 "The functions of the Abstract, Conclusions and Summary sections in engineering and scientific reports and papers are compared and contrasted. Each is found to serve a specific purpose and not to be interchangeable with the others. As an illustration mock specimens of these sections are developed and compared for Shakespeare's Othello."
"An idealistic biologist applies for a small grant for her research project and in the process learns about some of the social and economic conflicts between “basic” research, “applied” research, and. technology. A university dean, an industrial executive, and a young, radical social scientist take three different views of the proposed project in a dramatic confrontation intended to serve as the basis for an open panel discussion of the social implications of science and technology. The paper is written in the form of a play, which can be presented in about 30 minutes."
"Illegible and incomprehensible visual aids often result from confusion about sizes of lettering and symbols between the original artwork and its projected image. This paper discusses legibility standards used by industry and basic mathematical exercises to assure legibility of copy on visual aids used as original art or as reproduced slides."
"The duties of the Senior Editors at IEEE Headquarters and the support personnel are explained, and an indication of the amount of work handled in a year is given."
  "When is a handbook not a handbook? One answer to this paraphrased riddle might be, “When it is the most complete and sophisticated technical writing guide ever published.” The Jordan-Kleinman-Shimberg Handbook of Technical Writing Practices seems very well described by these words on its dust-jacket. A joint effort of Wiley-Interscience and the Society for Technical Communication, this work is a tour de force in the most complimentary sense of the phrase."
 "Presents the front cover for this issue of the publication."
  "Security classification in science and technology has aroused strong feelings, but there is little objective information about its effects. This paper presents the opposing, and highly subjective, points of view; summarizes objective studies of information flow; and reports an investigation of the flow of restricted and unrestricted information in a large research-and-development laboratory. The investigation showed that security classifications had little effect on the laboratory's procedure and output; however, additional research is indicated. Altogether this paper demonstrates the feasibility of obtaining empirical data on the effects of security classification on technical communication-data that are much needed, in view of the ongoing controversy."
"Citation analysis provides a tool for the evaluation of the relative importance of journals as well as papers. A publication, the ISI Journal Citation Reports, is issued primarily to permit users to make such evaluations by answering the basic questions: How often has a journal been cited? What journals have cited it and how frequently? What journals has it cited and how frequently? These data have been conditioned by the inclusion of a `relative impact factor' to give additional weight to the significance of the articles it publishes. The information thus developed is particularly attractive to librarians, journal editors and publishers, individual scientists, and science policy-makers."
"This paper appeared in its entirety in the September issue of the PC TRANSACTIONS. However, the text belonging at the end of the first paragraph was inadvertently located at the bottom of column 1. The entire page is reproduced here in its correct form."
"The writer of a technical paper looks at his subject from all angles before he starts to write. He asks himself a lot of questions; samples are suggested here. The answers to these help to keep him on course while he does the preliminary and final writing. As he does this work he is careful not to change direction and not to swamp his reader with unneeded data. The creator of Sherlock Holmes has at least two comments on these faults."
"The author suggests that the purpose of minutes is to inform those at the meeting and others, to provide information on past proceedings, and to progress ongoing items, and outlines the form the record should take to meet these requirements. Minutes must be in the style of a written communication and not of the spoken communication of the meeting; must be a record of facts and not a factual record; they must also be short, expressing concisely only that information which the readership requires."
"Guidelines and corresponding checklists aim towards providing criteria for preparing and evaluating planning documents. The criteria proposed are intended to assess the standards of quality acceptable to technical editors, authors, managers and customers. Detailed guidelines supported by over one hundred checklist items form the starting point for a procedure which rapidly and consistently identifies where planning reports do not meet minimum requirements. Hundreds of reports, primarily planning studies of interdisciplinary projects, such as airports, power generation and distribution plants, medical care facilities and socio-economic systems have validated the procedure. Guidelines and checklists are provided for: (1) Validation of Requirements, (2) Utilization of Resources, (3) Documentation of the Planning Process, and (4) Appraisal of Achievements and Workmanship Standards."
 "Holt, Rinehart and Winston have recently published two works on technical communication. Both of these are third editions of text-books which give chapter-end suggestions for writing-practice. As the two volumes cover about the same material, effort will be made here to point out dissimilarities in content, organization, and tone."
    "Presents the back cover for this issue of the publication."
"Using a small-signal analysis, we present a general comparison of the more important contributions to the incomplete transfer of charge in the following charge transfer devices: (i) the polyphase charge-coupled device and the IGFET bucket-brigade shift register, where individual charge transfers are single-step processes, and (ii) the two-phase charge-coupled device, the conductively connected charge-coupled device, the tetrode bucket brigade, and the stepped-oxide bucket brigade, where individual charge transfers are two-step processes. A recently proposed lumped-charge-model approximation is made in order to estimate the time dependence of the transferred charge including both drift and diffusion. In this calculation we also include the effects associated with the injection of charge from a diffused source into the IGFET channel which modify the current-voltage behavior at low currents. Using this calculation of the time dependence of the transferred charge, the various contributions to incomplete transfer, including those due to trapping in the interface states, are derived and compared for each of the charge transfer devices of interest."
"We consider the pulse-code-modulation encoder that contains a delta modulator for analog-to-digital conversion, and a finite impulse response digital filter that suppresses high-frequency components of the delta modulation signal. A PCM word generator produces fixed-length binary code words by rounding and amplitude limiting the filter output samples. The quantizing noise of the resulting PCM signal has four components: delta modulation slope overload noise, filtered delta modulation granular noise, amplitude overload noise, and word generator roundoff noise. We analyze the total quantizing noise for the case where the encoder input is a Gaussian random process and the digital filter impulse response is uniform (all coefficients equal). Such filters possess important implementation advantages and appear to be near optimal with respect to signal-to-noise performance. Our analysis results in curves which show the relationship of signal-to-noise ratio to filter order, delta modulation sampling rate, and PCM word length."
"We consider an uncladded dielectric waveguide core that is held by dielectric supports. The radiation losses caused by the support structure are being considered. The analysis is simplified by using a slab waveguide model held by slab-shaped supports. Only order-of-magnitude estimates are attempted. The radiation losses can be reduced by reducing the refractive index contrast between the supports and the surrounding medium with the help of an index matching liquid. The radiation losses remain large unless the index match is sufficiently close."
"A new approach to the automatic equalization of differentially phase-modulated data signals passing through a linear distorting medium is presented. The equalizer, which is of the transversal filter type, operates in the frequency passband and contains two sets of taps — in-phase and quadrature. A tap-rotation property of the equalizer is used to establish an absolute phase reference at the equalizer output, and once this crucial step is taken, the passband equalizer output can be used to automatically (as well as adaptively) adjust the tap weights so as to minimize a mean-square distortion function. The resulting algorithm requires correlating an error signal with the tap voltages, and thus it is possible to use a structure similar to that employed when equalizing baseband PAM. The generality of the approach makes it applicable to the equalization of any double-sideband data signal."
"The spectral characteristics of nondiversity and space diversity narrowband radio channels subject to multipath fading were estimated from a detailed sampling of channel loss variations as measured on two vertically separated antennas. The data base for this analysis was obtained during a 93-day experiment in which the amplitudes of a set of coherent tones spanning a band of 33.55 MHz and centered at 6034.2 MHz were continuously monitored. The most significant observations were: (i) For the nondiversity channel, the frequency selectivity of the received transmission loss generally exceeded linear and quadratic components (in frequency) of amplitude distortion for fade depths greater than 30 dB. (ii) For the diversity channel constructed by switching between a pair of narrowband channels received on two vertically spaced antennas, the frequency selectivity of the transmission loss was significantly reduced."
 "Currently there is strong interest in optical fibers for use as a transmission medium, analogous to the use of coaxial or wire pairs in the low-frequency region. Most work is devoted to a fiber structure consisting of a central glass core surrounded by a cylindrical glass cladding having a slightly lower index of refraction. This in turn requires that the chemical composition of the core glass differs from that of the cladding glass, leading to undesired effects at the core-cladding interface and perhaps limiting the minimum fiber losses achievable."
"The incomplete transfer of charge and the existence of random noise lead to the primary operational limitations of charge transfer devices. Owing to the signal dependence of the residual charge, which accumulates as a result of the incomplete transfer, signal detection with static detection levels becomes seriously impaired before the onset of significant signal attenuation or noise degradation. A scheme using dynamic detection levels is found to greatly extend the operational range of CTD's and achieves the minimum possible error rate for detecting uncorrelated charge packet sizes. By contrast, simple coding procedures are found to be ineffective in overcoming signal degradation due to incomplete transfer. Shannon's expression for maximum information transmission capacity is transformed into an expression for maximum information storage capacity. It is found that significantly larger storage capacities are possible with CTD's than have been achieved."
"A linear-space geometric theory of intersymbol interference is introduced in this paper. An equivalence between the structure of intersymbol interference and a wide-sense stationary discrete random process is demonstrated and exploited to demonstrate the equivalence of zero-forcing (decision-feedback) equalization to minimum mean-square error linear interpolation (prediction) of a random process. This equivalence is used to quickly derive the properties of these equalizers and give them additional geometric interpretation. Results from prediction theory are used to develop practical computational methods of determining the tap-gains of the infinite equalizers for both rational and nonrational channel power spectra. Finally, the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces is used to develop a theory of equalization for nonstationary channels with nonstationary noise."
"In a companion paper,1 a geometric approach to the study of intersymbol interference was introduced. In the present paper this approach is applied to the performance analysis of the Viterbi algorithm maximum likelihood detector (MLD) of Forney.2–4 It is shown that a canonical relationship exists between the minimum distance, which Forney has shown determines the performance of the MLD, and the performance and tap-gains of the decision-feedback equalizer (DFE). Upper and lower bounds on the minimum distance are derived, as is an iterative technique for computing it exactly. The performances of the MLD, DFE, and zero-forcing equalizer (ZFE) are compared on the √f channel representative of coaxial cables and some wire pairs. One important conclusion is that, previous statements notwithstanding,2.4 even the MLD experiences a substantial penalty in S/N ratio relative to the isolated pulse bound on this channel of practical interest."
"Maximum likelihood data sequence estimation, implemented by a dynamic programming algorithm known as the Viterbi algorithm (VA), is of considerable interest for data transmission in the presence of severe intersymbol interference and additive Gaussian noise. Unfortunately, the required number of receiver operations per data symbol is an exponential function of the duration of the channel impulse response, resulting in unacceptably large receiver complexity for high-speed PAM data transmission on many channels. We propose a linear prefilter to force the overall impulse response of the channel/prefilter combination to approximate a desired truncated impulse response (DIR) of acceptably short duration. Given the duration of the DIR, the prefilter parameters and the DIR itself can be optimized adaptively to minimize the mean-square error between the output of the prefilter and the desired prefilter output, while constraining the energy in the DIR to be fixed. In this work we show that the minimum mean-square error can be expressed as the minimum eigenvalue of a certain channel-dependent matrix, and that the corresponding eigenvector represents the optimum DIR. An adaptive algorithm is developed and successfully tested. The simulations also show that the prefiltering scheme, used together with the VA for two different channel models, compares favorably in performance with another recently proposed prefiltering scheme. Limiting results for the case where the prefilter is considered to be of infinite length are obtained; it is shown that the optimum DIR of length two must be one of two possible impulse responses related to the duobinary impulse response. Finally we obtain limiting results for the case where the transmitting filter is optimized."
"New technologies of fiber manufacture and a demand for unusual fiber qualities in communication systems have intensified the interest in a comprehensive theory of multimode fibers with nonuniform index distributions. This paper deals with a general class of circular symmetric profiles which comprise the parabolic distribution and the abrupt core-cladding index step as special cases. We obtain general results of useful simplicity for the impulse response, the mode volume, and the near- and far-field power distributions. We suggest a modified parabolic distribution for best equalization of mode delay differences. The effective width of the resulting impulse is more than four times smaller than that produced by the parabolic profile. Of course, practical manufacturing tolerances are likely to influence this distribution. A relation is derived between the maximum index error and the impulse response."
"Cables made from brittle materials like glass require new techniques of end preparation for the purpose of splicing, especially if such splices are to be made in the field. We report here on a method of breaking fibers in a way which invariably produces flat and perpendicular end faces. We explain the underlying theory and derive optimal parameters that permit the design of a simple breaking tool. Experiments with a tool of this kind show that the tolerances for successful fracture are not critical. Laboratory splices of multimode fibers prepared by this method exhibited losses of less than 1 percent (0.04 dB) when joined in index-matching fluid."
"An analytic model for the steady-state behavior of an overloaded telephone network is given. The model includes trunk and machine congestion, retrials, “don't answer and busy,” and some network management controls. It is significantly cheaper to use than Monte Carlo simulations for moderate size networks. It compares well with Monte Carlo simulation calculations of point-to-point completion probabilities and the expected number of messages in progress. It compares less well for sender attachment delay and probability of time-out calculations in switching machines."
"In trunking theory, peakedness is defined conventionally as the variance-to-mean ratio of a traffic load when carried on an infinite trunk group. For analysis of switching machine delays, it has proven useful to define a peakedness measure associated with the Carried Arrival Process (CAP), the stream of call arrivals carried on an incoming trunk group. The peakedness of the CAP is defined to be the conventional peakedness of a fictitious traffic-load process generated by associating with each carried arrival an independent exponentially distributed holding time with mean equal to the mean of calls actually carried on the trunk group. The problem considered is the effect of trunk group congestion on the peakedness of the CAP for traffic consisting of renewal inputs offered on a blocked-calls-cleared basis to a finite trunk group with exponential holding times. The CAP is characterized as a semi-Markov process. This model leads to the determination of the peakedness of the CAP. Numerical results illustrate the reduction of peakedness, or smoothing, introduced by the congestion."
"Experimental data on visual spatio-temporal sine-wave thresholds obtained by Robson and Kelly are considered. In seeking model approximations to the data it is assumed that the subject's visual threshold to modulation at different spatial and temporal frequencies gives the image of his filter function to within a multiplicative constant. It is further assumed that the data can be approximated by a system with a spatially uniform, isotropic, and temporally invariant response which consists of the difference between an excitatory and an inhibitory term, and that each term is separable into a product of a spatial and a temporal function."
 "The equivalent random method1 (aso see Ref. 2) is widely used to approximate the blocking probabiUties for non-Poisson traffic streams. Although much numerical experience and some analjrsis (e.g., Ref. 3) suggests that the method is usually reliable for superpositions of overflows, the reason for its accuracy (or errors) deserves further attention."
"A 250-element charge coupled device is described in which the transfer electrodes are delineated and isolated using an undercut-etch technique. The device has metal electrodes on two thicknesses of oxide and is primarily intended to be operated in a two-phase manner. Measurements of transfer inefficiency as a function of frequency have been made on both n- and p-channel devices. Below 1 MHz, values of 4 × 10−4 per transfer independent of transfer frequency have been obtained. Above 1 MHz the transfer inefficiency progressively rises as the dynamics of charge motion limit the transfer of charge."
"Queues arising in buffers due to either random interruptions of the channel or variable source rates are analyzed in the framework of a single switched system. Examples of systems to which the results of the paper may be applied are: multiplexing of speech with data in telephone channels and, in certain instances, buffering of data generated by the coding of moving images in the Picturephone® system. The switched system consists of a uniform source, buffer, switch and channel. The source feeds data to the buffer at a uniform rate. The buffer's access to the channel is controlled by the switch; if the switch is closed, the buffer empties to the extent of the channel's transmission rate. The on-off pattern of the switch is indicated by a 0 — 1 burst process {Ej} j = 0, 1, 2, − − − if Ej = 0, the switch is closed for the duration [j, j + 1). The burst phenomenon is introduced to account for two different processes responsible for the event Ej = 0. There are relatively long periods during which Ej = 0 uniformly, and the activity separated by such periods is defined to be a burst. During a burst, Ej = 0 only infrequently. The duration of a burst is an independently distributed random variable with a geometric or weighted sum of geometric distributions. The inter-burst periods are assumed to be sufficiently long for the buffer to empty at some point during these periods of inactivity. During a burst {Ej} is a Bernoulli sequence of independent random variables. Exact expressions for a variety of performance functionals related to the system described above are obtained, together with qualitative results. Recursive formulas are obtained for the following: (i) steady-state distribution of buffer content for a finite buffer of size N; (ii) mean time for first passage across a level N; (iii) the probability of overflow, for a given level N during a burst; (iv) mean time for first passage across a level N during a burst. The recursion in each case is with respect to N. The asymptotic behavior of the main recursions is determined."
"The frame-to-frame coder described in Ref. 1 used an 8-bit PCM signal for input. If, instead, the signal is obtained by digitally integrating the output of an element difference coder, the quantization noise may be misinterpreted as motion, and cause unnecessary transmission. In the particular example of the Phase I coder,2 the quantization noise loads the frame codec to the extent that it produces an unacceptable picture. In this paper, a frame-to-frame coder for Picturephone® signals is described which is capable of coding the digital output of a Phase I codec for transmission over a 2-megabit/second channel. Improved methods are used to segment the noisy picture into moving areas and background areas. The moving areas are then transmitted using a number of data reduction techniques. During periods of slow movement, clusters of frame-to-frame differences in the moving area are transmitted. For moderate movement, frame differences are sent only in every other field, the moving areas of intervening fields being transmitted by a conditional field interpolation technique. For rapid movement, 2:1 horizontal subsampling is used, and, finally, during violent motion when the buffer fills, frame repeating is used. The picture quality obtained from a laboratory simulation of this system is believed to be satisfactory even for a very active subject. With small amounts of motion the subjective quality is actually improved because the visibility of the quantizing noise from the Phase I codec is reduced by the inherent frame repeating action of the coder."
"A novel circuit technique is described for embedding a high-frequency amplifier in a low-frequency circuit to achieve a defined, flat gain from dc to the cutoff frequency of the hf amplifier. The technique provides this low-frequency gain without compromising the hf design optimization. An embodiment of this technique is described which has provided, experimentally, amplifier gain from dc to a half-power point of 2.3 GHz."
"This paper presents a collection of formulas that are necessary for the treatment of radiation and mode conversion phenomena of imperfect asymmetric slab waveguides. The coupled mode theory of dielectric waveguides is briefly reviewed, and general expressions for the coupling coefficients are given. The field expression of the guided and the radiation TE and TM modes of the asymmetric slab waveguide are stated, and are used to derive formulas for the coupling coefficient for slight core boundary irregularities."
"Delay probability formulas for batch input to a finite number of constant-holding-time servers are derived under the assumption of statistical equilibrium. The service-delay distribution (delay until a first request from the batch enters service) is given in terms of the roots of a transcendental equation, while the probability of no service-delay and the average delay are expressed directly in terms of the number of servers, the holding time, and the parameters of the input process. A numerical example with a fixed batch size is discussed."
"The crosstalk between two identical, uniformly coupled, lossy transmission lines is examined. Equations are derived which can be solved to obtain formulas for the near-end crosstalk (NEXT) and far-end crosstalk (FEXT). An example is worked which illustrates the mutual influence of the two lines in terms of the modal voltages and currents. The mutual influence of the two lines is also studied by comparing the results of this example with the “classical” crosstalk formulas which assume weak coupling and neglect the influence of the disturbed line on the disturbing line. It is shown that the influence of the disturbed line on the disturbing line can be neglected for NEXT for most weak coupling situations. For sufficiently high frequencies and/or long line lengths, however, this influence cannot be neglected for FEXT."
"Previously published results on the performance of optical direct detection digital receivers using avalanche detectors are extended to the case where incoherent noise due to quantum amplifiers in the transmission medium is present at the detector. These calculations are applied to determine the usefulness of quantum amplifiers in simple digital transmission systems where the optical source instability results in a required amplifier bandwidth which may be orders of magnitude greater than the modulation bandwidth. It is concluded that practical applications exist where quantum amplifiers can be used in analog repeaters between regenerating repeaters in a hybrid digital system; and also as front ends of regenerating repeaters to increase their sensitivities."
"The question of whether an electrical circuit can be laid out on a plane, without resorting to crossovers or multilayer wiring, is usually answered by testing the planarity of a graph representing the circuit. Two commonly used representations are shown to be inadequate. We present the following new representation, and show it to be complete and unrestrictive: The graph has one node for each circuit module, and one node for each net; for every net with k modules, there is a “star” of k edges connecting the net's node to each of the modules of the net."
 "IMPATT diode microwave oscillators suffer from the effects of low-frequency instabilities, which include excessive up-conversion of bias-circuit noise, bias-circuit oscillations, and diode burnout induced by tuning at the microwave frequency. These instabilities are particularly troublesome in GaAs diodes, although also present in both Ge and Si to a lesser extent. Moreover, these instabilities are more prominent in higher efficiency, higher power diodes, presenting a severe systems problem in the practical utilization of GaAs diodes at their highest power and efficiency levels. In this paper, it is shown that these instabilities may be eliminated in a systematic and well controlled manner with little or no loss in microwave power or efficiency. It is shown that the source of the unstable behavior is a low-frequency RF voltage-induced negative resistance which extends from dc to several tens, and perhaps hundreds, of megahertz, depending on the loaded Q of the microwave circuit. The negative resistance is an unavoidable fact of large-signal avalanche diode operation and is due to the rectification properties of the nonlinear microwave avalanche."
"Bubble technology offers several operations that have no equivalents in technologies based on magnetic recording. Examples of such operations are: transfer, reversal of the direction of propagation, and opening and closing of gaps in the data stream. This paper∗ shows how such operations can be used to dynamically reallocate data in the bubble memory, causing it to become an integrated memory hierarchy. A considerable improvement in performance results. A model is presented which relates the bubble memory with dynamic reallocation to stack processing, a technique used in the evaluation of memory hierarchies. With the aid of this model it becomes possible to calculate the performance of the bubble memory using published data derived from the traces of selected typical programs. Memory design is optimized for the execution of such programs. Design parameters are proposed for a 2-Mb bubble memory with 128 detectors which, in the execution of the type of program for which data were available, requires an average of only 8.8 shifts for access and an average of 12.1 shifts per memory cycle. If bubbles are propagated at a rate of 1 MHz, the average access and cycle times for this memory become 8.8 µs and 12.1 µs, respectively. Such performance, in conjunction with the low cost per bit offered by bubble technology, is expected to have a major impact. The performance of this memory, when operated in conjunction with a faster buffer, is also calculated. The use of a 64-kb buffer is shown to reduce the average number of shifts for access to 1.05, and the average number of shifts per cycle to 1.9."
"The Poincaré sphere has been applied to the analysis of orthogonalizing two polarization ellipses by a differential phase shifter and a differential attenuator. The condition of minimum differential attenuation for removing a given amount of nonorthogonality is determined. A previously reported transformation via two nonorthogonal linear polarizations should be used for two slender ellipses.1 Another transformation via two oppositely rotating ellipses having parallel axes and equal axial ratios should be used for two fat ellipses. System applications of the transformations are discussed."
"This paper presents a theoretical treatment of the roundoff noise problem for the special case of cascade realizations of Finite Impulse Response (FIR) digital filters.† Explicit relations for evaluating roundoff noise with the usual assumption of uncorrelated samples are presented. Useful scaling methods are stated and classified as to conditions when these methods are optimum. Important differences between use of these scaling procedures for Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters and FIR filters are pointed out. Finally, useful properties of linear phase FIR filters are discussed."
"Experimental results on roundoff noise in cascade realizations of Finite Impulse Response (FIR) digital filters are presented in this paper.∗ The entire roundoff noise distribution (i.e., over all possible orderings) is given for several low-order filters using both sum and peak scaling. Based on observations about this distribution, as well as intuitive arguments about the effects of ordering on roundoff noise, an algorithm for minimizing roundoff noise is presented. Experimental verification of this algorithm for a wide range of filters is given."
"This paper derives a slope overload noise power formula for linear delta modulators having ideal integrators and Gaussian random inputs. Although the same problem has been treated by others, the present result is the only one applicable to all slope-following capacities and input spectra. Despite its singleness of purpose, the paper divides logically into two parts. In Part 1, a common element in all previously published results is used to derive a new slope overload noise power formula. This derivation is analytically rigorous and provides some useful insights, but pertains to a particular kind of spectrum and so is incomplete. The more universal result we seek is derived in Part 2. The approach here is far less rigorous and amounts to approximating the influences of other kinds of spectra by modifying the result of Part 1. The final expression contains four spectrum-related coefficients, for which simple formulas are given, and has an estimated accuracy of 1 dB for all cases of practical interest. Computed results are given for two important families of spectra and comparisons are made with previously published results."
"The dielectric optical waveguide described in this paper has an annular cross section, the refractive index of which is higher than the indices of the material inside and outside of the ring. The solution of the eigenvalue problem is an approximation which is valid for small refractive index differences of the three media. The resulting approximate eigenvalue equation is far simpler than its exact counterpart. The cutoff conditions of the first three modes and the eigenvalue of the lowest-order mode are presented graphically."
"Traffic overflowing a first-choice trunk group can be approximated accurately by a simple renewal process called an interrupted Poisson process–a Poisson process which is alternately turned on for an exponentially distributed time and then turned off for another (independent) exponentially distributed time. The approximation is obtained by matching either the first two or three moments of an interrupted Poisson process to those of an overflow process. Numerical investigation of errors in the approximation and subsequent experience has shown that this method of generating overflow traffic is accurate and very useful in both simulations and analyses of traffic systems."
 "The propagation constants (loss and phase) are determined for the normal modes in dielectric-lined overmoded (guide radius » wavelength) circular guide by numerical solutions of the appropriate characteristic equations. It is shown that the heat loss of the TMpn modes is quite low and decreases with increasing frequency in contrast to the increase in heat loss predicted by the perturbation theory for thin linings. The primary effect of the low-loss TMpn modes on a transmission system using the TE01 mode is a reduction in the route bend losses."
"Experimental measurements have been carried out to verify the recent theoretical prediction that, in dielectric-lined circular waveguide, modes other than those of the TEon family can exhibit a loss characteristic which decreases with increasing frequency. The TM11 waveguide was launched in 51-mm diameter circular waveguide lined with a 200-micron layer of polyethylene, and its loss characteristics were measured. Losses of 23 dB/km at 80 GHz and 3.5 dB/km at 110 GHz were measured, thus confirming the decreasing loss with increasing frequency trend predicted by theory."
"This study of prefilters and sampling rates analyzes the edge busyness phenomenon which is a very significant degradation introduced by intraframe video coders. For any given transmission rate, the prefilter and sampling rate can be varied to yield a tradeoff between the edge busyness and the rise time associated with a video transition. A narrower prefilter results in less edge busyness but slower rise times and vice versa. Similarly, varying the sampling rate implies an inverse variation in the number of bits per sample allowed in the quantizer, which leads to a tradeoff between aliasing and quantizing noise, both of which are components of the edge busyness phenomenon. This paper shows in detail how the prefilter, sampler, and quantizer affect both edge busyness and rise time, and optimizes the intraframe coder design as a function of transmission rate from an analysis of this two-factor tradeoff."
"A synthesis technique is developed for the active RC realization of transfer functions that have all their transmission zeros on the imaginary (jω) axis. The method leads to a realization using biquadratic blocks in a multiple-feedback arrangement that is the generalization of the structure obtained from the passive, double-terminated reactive equivalents. The realization combines the easy independent tuning properties of the cascade, with the low-sensitivity characteristics of passive ladders."
"Thirty-one sets of experimental data on the statistics of microwave rain attenuation at frequencies above 10 GHz, in the U.S.A., England, Japan, Italy, and Canada, indicate that: (i) the distribution of rain attenuation α, in dB, is approximately lognormal with a standard deviation σα of log10 α ranging from 0.46 to 0.71 for earth-space paths, and from 0.33 to 0.86 for terrestrial paths; (ii) the distribution of the rain fade duration τ is also approximately lognormal with a standard deviation στ of log10 τ ranging from 0.44 to 0.76 for both earth-space paths and terrestrial paths. We propose a theory to explain this general behavior. A theoretical upper bound for the fade duration distribution in the tail region is also given. The findings in this paper simplify the determination of rain attenuation statistics needed for the design of earth-satellite radio links and terrestrial radio links."
"Low-loss joints between single-mode optical fibers have been made without microscopic alignment, without fusing the tips, and without monitoring the transmitted power while the joints are assembled. The fibers are tightly held in an embossed groove; an index-matching liquid is added. Average power coupling efficiencies close to 90 percent in the red and to 85 percent in the infrared have been obtained. Mediocre end faces are acceptable. Realistic discrepancies between the fiber cladding diameters (slightly in excess of twice the core diameter) do not deteriorate the results."
 "We give calculated results of differential attenuation and differential phase shift caused by rain, based on scattering of a plane electromagnetic wave by horizontally disposed oblate spheroidal raindrops. Two polarizations of the incident wave are considered, as depicted in Fig. 1. The factor e−iwt has been suppressed. Subscripts I and II designate electric fields parallel and perpendicular to the plane containing the axis of symmetry of the raindrop and the direction of propagation of the incident wave, respectively. The angle between the direction of propagation and the axis of symmetry is denoted by α. For terrestrial microwave relay systems we take α = π/2, but for satellite systems other values of a are of interest."
"Consider a nonlinear system, with memory, which has two input ports and one output port. It is assumed that the system can be represented by a double Volterra series. Two results for such a system are stated in Part I. The first is a general expression for the sinusoidal components of the output y (t) when the two inputs xu (t) and xv(t) are sums of sinusoidal terms. The second result is an expression for the power spectrum of y (t) when xu(t) is a stationary Gaussian process and xv(t) = P cos pt. Part II is concerned with using results from the theory of Volterra series for multi-input systems to calculate the third-order distortion in an idealized frequency converter."
"A method is suggested for inserting viewer criteria directly into coding algorithms; any complex visual model may be used. The technique is applied to a DPCM-type coder, and a number of variations are compared on the basis of entropy, quality, and complexity. It is found that, using a simple one-dimensional filter model, the first-order entropy of the DPCM signal can be reduced by 30 percent for a high-detail picture with only a small reduction in picture quality. Furthermore, by means of a single threshold control, one can efficiently trade off bit-rate and picture quality over a large range for use in adaptive strategies."
"Simple statistical procedures for analyzing error data, e.g., in digital data transmission systems, are usually based on the assumption of independence. This paper studies the performance and potential utility of such simple statistical procedures in the case of nonindependent error occurrences. The burst noise model is selected for this purpose because of its neatness, its mathematical tractability, its built-in structure of dependence, and its importance in communication theory. We show that statistical procedures designed under the assumption of independence tend to be conservative for the burst noise model. For example, the usual binomial test will reject, on the average, more channels with small error rates than it would if the errors were independent. The case that the sample size n and the error rate ρ converge in such a way that nρ→ µ0 is also studied. It is shown that the error process can be approximated by a compound Poisson process in continuous time t. The statistical implications of this fact are also discussed."
"A recent development effort in telecommunications switching apparatus has been directed toward the production of a remanent reed, dry, sealed contact (remreed). Remendur, a medium-hard magnetic alloy nominally composed of equal parts iron and cobalt and 2.7-wt. percent vanadium, was chosen as the reed material in this contact. However, the application required the alloy to possess rather specific magnetic and mechanical properties and considerable difficulty was experienced in consistently processing Remendur into wire with these specified properties. To ascertain the sensitivity of these properties to variations in processing times and temperatures, and vanadium content, two melts of Remendur (2.5-percent V and 3.0-percent V) were processed with selected alterations in annealing temperatures at several stages. Microstructures were characterized following each step by light microscopy and were correlated with the appropriate ternary equilibrium diagram. Results demonstrate that microstructures developed by anneals between 900°C and 950°C are extremely sensitive to the precise temperature of the anneal and composition of the alloy. The microstructure, which strongly influences magnetic and mechanical properties, can be varied over the limits of the two-phase α1 + γ region by variations in vanadium content of only 0.5 wt. percent and by the small 50°C temperature range."
"In this work we report new results relating to decision feedback equalization. The equalizer and the transmitting filter are optimized in a PAM data communication system operating over a linear noisy channel. We use a mean-square error criterion and impose an average power constraint at the transmitter. Assuming correct past decisions, an explicit formula for the minimum attainable mean-square error is given. The possible advantages of signaling faster than the Nyquist rate while decreasing the number of levels to maintain the same information rate are investigated. It is shown that, in all cases of practical interest, signaling faster than the Nyquist rate, while keeping fixed the information rate, increases the mean-square error. Finally, to illustrate the use of the results, application is made to a cable channel where the loss in dB varies as the square root of frequency. Various asymptotic formulas and curves are provided to exhibit the relationships between the quantities of interest."
"Under equilibrium conditions, the sample average of the delays encountered by all the calls submitted during a given time interval is an unbiased estimate of the mean of the delay distribution. If some of the delays are not observed, the resulting sample average need no longer be an unbiased estimator of the corresponding population mean. This is the case when, for instance, only a limited number of delays can be timed simultaneously. The purpose of this paper is to investigate these biases for queuing systems when only one clock is available and thus one delay only can be measured at a time. It is shown that, regardless of the order of service, the expected value of the observed average delays is always smaller than the mean waiting time for all calls. Although the average delay on all calls is independent of the order of service, the measurement biases resulting when only one delay can be measured at once depend on the queue discipline. In particular, we shall show that the average delay for all calls is always larger than the average delay of the observed calls even if these calls are always served last (observed-call served-last)."
"We consider an N-server queuing system with Poisson arrivals and exponential service, in which arriving customers must pass through a gate into a waiting room before becoming eligible for service. Customers who find the gate closed wait outside until the gate opens; customers inside the waiting room are served at random. When the last customer inside acquires a server, the gate admits all those outside and then closes again. If no customer is waiting outside when the gate opens, the gate remains open until there is a queue of k waiting customers. Service offered by this system is intermediary between random service and order-of-arrival service. As long as the gate is open and fewer than N + k customers are in the system, service is purely random. The parameter k can be regarded as a threshold at which the queue is judged too long to permit random service to continue. Our main results are (i) the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the equilibrium distribution of the waiting time of an arbitrary customer and (ii) a comparison of the second moments of the waiting time for different values of k with those of the waiting time under random service and order-of-arrival service. The service is shown to be “nearly random” at low loads and “not quite order-of-arrival” at high loads; for higher values of k this transition occurs at higher traffic intensities."
"The coupling coefficients of the modes of a parabolic index fiber with randomly curved axis are derived and are used to compute its excess losses and impulse response. It is found that bends with a period comparable to the natural ray oscillation period in the parabolic index medium are catastrophic. The average radius of curvature Rc of a guide composed of circular sections with an average length of 1 cm must not decrease below approximately Rc = 1 m. Mode coupling by random bends has the tendency to reduce the width of the impulse response function. However, this improvement is accompanied by losses. Reducing the width of the impulse response for coupled mode operation to half its uncoupled width causes 0.7 dB additional loss, a ten-fold reduction of the pulse width costs 18 dB."
"Analysis and computations made here, corroborated by experiment, determine the effects of axial displacement and angular misalignment on the power coupled between butt-joined, single-mode optical fibers. The absolute accuracy with which fibers must be joined on-centers is reduced for fibers with relatively smaller core; the angular accuracy is increased."
 "A communication system is studied in which two users communicate with one receiver over a common discrete memoryless channel. The information to be transmitted by the users may be correlated. Their information rates are described by a point in a suitably defined three-dimensional rate space. A point in this rate space is called admissible if there exist coders and decoders for the channel that permit the users to transmit information over it at the corresponding rates with arbitrarily small error probability. The closure of the set of all admissible rate points is called the capacity region, and is the natural generalization of channel capacity to this situation. In this paper we show that e, which depends only on the channel, is convex and we give formulas to determine it exactly. Several simple channels are treated in detail and their capacity regions given explicitly."
"We give a solution to the problem of designing a fixed compromise equalizer for use in transmission systems involving an ensemble of random channels. The signal and noise spectra, along with the second-order statistics of the channel ensemble, are used to find the equalizer characteristic that minimizes the mean-square distortion between the equalizer output and a scaled version of the transmitter output. The key departure from previous work is that the criterion better captures practical performance invariance; specifically, the cost function incorporates the insensitivity of a well-designed demodulator to any amplitude scaling or time delay introduced by a particular channel. After demonstrating that the optimum equalizer shape is related to the principal eigenfunction of a normalized channel correlation function, we consider several special cases that give further insight into the properties of the solution. We find that the equalizer amplitude is attenuated over those frequencies where the signal-to-noise or signal-to-channel-variance ratios are small. The analysis confirms the standard engineering practice of inverting the average channel in the absence of noise and when the variance of the channel characteristics is small."
"When a1, a2, … are independent random variables, each equal to ± 1 with probability ½, the sum Σ1∞ an/ n is a random variable whose distribution is difficult to determine theoretically. This sum is of interest in the study of intersymbol interference in digital communication systems. Here the distribution of the sum is computed by numerical integration and the results tabulated. Asymptotic expressions are given for the tails of the distribution."
"We describe an adaptive differential PCM (ADPCM) coder which makes instantaneous exponential changes of quantizer step-size. The coder includes a simple first-order predictor and a time-invariant, minimally complex adaptation strategy. Step-size multipliers depend only on the most recent quantizer output, and input signals of unknown variance can be accommodated. We derive appropriate multiplier values from computer simulations with speech signals and with Gauss-Markov inputs. We compare performance of the ADPCM coder with conventional log-PCM, using both objective and subjective criteria. Finally, we describe an economical integrated hardware implementation of the ADPCM coder. We believe that at bit rates of 24 to 32 kb/s, ADPCM provides a robust and efficient technique for speech communication and for digital storage of speech."
"We discuss a quantizer which, for every new input sample, adapts its step-size by a factor depending only on the knowledge of which quantizer slot was occupied by the previous signal sample.1 Specifically, if the outputs of a uniform B-bit quantizer (B > 1) are of the form the step-size Δr, is given by the previous step-size multiplied by a time-invariant function of the code-word magnitude: The adaptations are motivated by the assumption that the input signal variance is unknown, so that the quantizer is started off, in general, with a suboptimal step-size ΔSTART. Multiplier functions that maximize the signal-to-quantization-error ratio (SNR) depend, in general, on ΔSTART and the input sequence length N. For example, if the signal is stationary and N → ∞ best multipliers, irrespective of ΔSTART, have values arbitrarily close to unity. On the other hand, small values of N and suboptimal values of ΔSTART necessitate M values further away from unity. By including an adequate range of values for N and ΔSTART in a generalized SNR definition, we show how one can determine stable multiplier functions MOPT that are optimal for a given signal. In computer simulations of 2- and 3-bit quantizers with first-order Gauss-Markovian inputs, we note that, except when the magnitude of the correlation C between adjacent samples is very high, MOPT has the property of calling for fast increases and slow decreases of step-size. We derive optimum multipliers theoretically for two simple cases:"
"This paper discusses a heuristic solution procedure for a combinatorial optimization problem that originates in designing signal constellations for modems. The design problem is to place m signals in a two-dimensional space to minimize the average error rate under specified noise conditions, using a maximum-likelihood decoding scheme. Intuitively, it amounts (roughly) to spreading the signal points as far apart as possible, according to the distance measurement implied by the noise function. We show how this problem can be reduced to a discrete one: Given an ℓ by n matrix P, and m < ℓ, find an m-row subset M = {i1, …, im} of the rows of P that maximizes and then describe an efficient procedure for finding this maximizing set. Experiments indicate that the procedure is a useful tool, both for analysis of existing and proposed signal constellations and for finding new, near-optimum ones."
"The index distribution in the cross section of a multimode fiber has an important influence on the modal group velocities and, hence, on the fiber impulse response. In this paper we derive a method for the evaluation of arbitrary circular symmetric index profiles. In particular, we compute the impulse response of a fiber with a ring-shaped parabolic index profile which exhibits useful equalizing properties. The pulse spread is found to be nearly one order of magnitude smaller than that of a fiber with an equal, but abrupt, index decline from core to cladding."
"To the paraxial approximation there is no difference in the group delay of the modes of a parabolic index fiber. However, the wave optics treatment of the infinitely extended parabolic index medium predicts a slight difference in the group delay of the various modes. This result is used in this paper to predict the shape and width of the impulse response function of a parabolic index fiber with finite radius."
"If a sequence of digitally on-off modulated optical pulses is injected into a dielectric waveguide, these pulses may begin to overlap after a sufficient distance of propagation because of material dispersion and/or group delay spreading. In general, the pulses will not add linearly in power, which can complicate the problem of equalization of the square-law (power) detected overlapping output pulses at baseband. This paper illustrates important situations in which the guide may be treated as “pseudo-linear” in power, meaning that the detected guide output pulses appear to add linearly."
"A telephone network with switching and trunk congestion is considered. An optimization problem expressed in terms of mean numbers of calls and mean rates of flow of calls in various categories of service throughout the network is formulated. The maximum mean number of talking calls given by this optimization problem is an upper bound on the mean number of talking calls which could be carried by the network using theoretically optimum network management. Examples are given suggesting that the upper bound is close to values which actually can be attained. The optimum of the problem is achieved by controls which (i) restrict the number of calls coming into the network from the end offices and (ii) route appropriate fractions of the remaining calls over the various possible routes."
"This paper treats the problem of analyzing a first-come first-served queuing system, in equilibrium, when subjected to a peaked input (e.g., traffic overflowing a trunk group with Poisson input). The basic GI/M/N (renewal input to N exponential servers) queuing result is used, together with each of two models for representing peaked traffic, the Equivalent Random (E-R) model and the Interrupted Poisson Process (IPP) model. The equilibrium virtual delay distribution is derived and compared with the equilibrium distribution of delays seen by arriving calls. Numerical examples are presented, along with comparisons of results using both the above models. The results show that delays can be quite sensitive to peakedness."
"Several methods are reported for making splices in optical fibers. The methods have application to both liquid-core and solid-core fibers and have been demonstrated for liquid-core fibers. The lowest-loss splice consists of an inserted glass pin and an outer sleeve. Best repeatable results are 0.4 dB loss in the splice. A splicing device has been constructed which provides automatic alignment of the components and automatic assembly for several fibers at once. The technique may be directly extended to multiple splicing as for fiber cables."
"Concept of n-width and extremal subspaces, first introduced by Kolmogorov, plays an important part in mathematical problems of approximation of classes of functions and in engineering problems of signal representation and reconstruction. In this short paper, explicit expressions for n-width and extremal subspaces are obtained for a class which is of some engineering importance."
  "The bandwidth required to transmit an FM wave is related to how much distortion is allowed in the signal. Here expressions are developed for the distortion (interchannel interference) produced when an FDM-FM wave passes through an ideal filter. The signal is represented by a flat (PM) band of Gaussian noise. The formulas obtained hold only for small rms frequency deviation, but fortunately this is an important case in microwave communication systems. The theoretical expressions agree well with Monte Carlo results published recently by Anuff and Liou."
"This paper describes a method for computing baseband distortion in analog FM communication systems; the method is based on recent theoretical work available in the literature. The input baseband signal is taken to be a zero-mean, stationary Gaussian process having an arbitrary power spectral density. A variety of graphical results are presented in order to demonstrate the utility of this method of computing FM distortion. It is shown that the often-used noise loading test does not necessarily represent a worst-case test."
"This paper studies a general description of interchannel and intra-channel crosstalk interference created in a communications system. This description is in the form of a Volterra series expansion of the interference signal in terms of the signal which produced the interference. From it we are able to precisely define the “intelligible” part of the crosstalk. This description also provides us with quantitative measures of the amount of crosstalk created in some communications channel by signals in another channel, as well as a measure (intelligible crosstalk ratio) of the amount of intelligible crosstalk produced. We then consider a particular model for the generation of intelligible crosstalk [or direct adjacent channel interference (DACI)] between two neighboring angle-modulated channels in which the signal in one channel adds to the signal of the second channel, the sum is filtered, and the filter output then passes through an AM-PM conversion device. Using our definition, a simple expression for the intelligible crosstalk ratio for this model is derived in terms of the filter characteristic. We observe that this crosstalk ratio exhibits a number of properties usually associated with DACI."
"A two-dimensional analysis of the potential in charge coupled devices is presented. It is assumed that there are no mobile minority carriers, that the plate separation is zero, and that the plate voltage does not vary with time. The depletion layer approximation is used to linearize the equations, which are then solved exactly with the use of Fourier series. Both surface and buried channel devices are analyzed. These solutions can typically be evaluated on a computer in less than a tenth of the time it takes to obtain a solution by the method of finite differences. The solutions obtained here provide an important tool for the designer of charge coupled devices. In addition to describing the method of obtaining the solutions, we evaluate them to show the effects of a number of different design parameters, and compare the cost of these solutions with the cost of obtaining finite difference solutions."
"A connecting network is called strictly nonblocking if no call is blocked in any state; it is nonblocking in the wide sense if there exists a rule for routing calls through the network so as to avoid all states in which calls are blocked, and yet still satisfy all demands for connection as they arise, without disturbing calls already present. Characterizations of both senses of nonblocking have been given in previous work, using simple metric and closure topologies defined on the set of states. We give new characterizations based on the natural map γ (·) that carries each state into the assignment it satisfies. This map is a semilattice homomorphism, such that γ (x) ∩ γ(y) ≧ γ (x ∩ y). It turns out that the case of equality in this inequality is very relevant to nonblocking performance. In particular, let a subset X of states be said to have the intersection property if for every x in X and every assignment a there exists y in X such that y realizes a (i.e., γ (y) = a) and γ(x ∩ y) = γ (x) ∩ γ (y). Then a network is nonblocking in the wide sense if and only if some subset of its states has the intersection property, and it is strictly nonblocking if and only if the entire set of states has the intersection property."
"Definite integrals of analytic functions can often be evaluated efficiently by the trapezoidal rule after a suitable transformation. Here the work of Moran1 and Schwartz2 along this line is extended. First the dependence of the error on the spacing is discussed, and then several types of transformations are described and applied to integrals of technical interest."
"A new approach to time-domain pulse shaping in digital sampled systems is described. The proposed method allows time-limited impulse responses with optimum specified energy distribution in the frequency domain to be generated. Additional constraints to guarantee zero intersymbol interference are easily taken into account. Nyquist-type pulses which have the maximum possible amount of their total energy concentrated below some given frequency are one particularly important application. An example of such an impulse response with only 6 percent excess bandwidth is presented which shows that 99.96 percent of the energy can be concentrated in the desired bandwidth with a pulse 16 baud intervals long that can be generated using a read-only memory (ROM) with only 256 bits of storage. This new class of signals can be used advantageously for waveform generation and processing in digital data systems."
"Recent advances in solid-state optical-frequency sources and detectors and low-loss optical fibers make feasible the consideration of optical communication systems for low- and moderate-bandwidth channels (a few kHz to, say, 100 MHz). This paper explores the use of optical-frequency carrier systems for transmission over such channels. Analog intensity modulation, pulse position modulation, delta modulation, and pulse code modulation are considered. This paper is intended to be tutorial in nature."
 "This paper and the following three describe computer systems to store, retrieve, and manipulate information. These have all utilized time-shared computer systems. All have evolved toward a system constructed of modular component parts and having a high degree of user interaction. Considerable attention has been given to implementation in a form suitable for simple transfer to systems of adequate capability with minimal programming effort. The data bases involved are all hierarchical in organization. The major parts are a language facility, a data base manager, a processing package, and numerous coordinated administration functions. The parts are currently assembled into a package which can be applied to an arbitrary hierarchically structured data base with little user effort. The component parts are also available for integration into more tailored systems for special applications."
"MASTER LINKS is a software system used to build, administer, and access hierarchical data bases. It is designed to operate in a time-sharing environment, and, in particular, it allows multiple concurrent updates and retrievals on the same data base. A BUILD module is used to specify the hierarchical configuration of a data base and an initial “storage mapping” of the elements of the hierarchy into a particular file layout. A set of administrative routines is provided for altering the mapping and other such maintenance purposes. The access routines have three levels of interface, from primitive and flexible to sophisticated and functional. The interfaces are all defined in terms of the hierarchical structure and independent of the storage mapping. Thus, an alteration of the storage mapping for a data base does not require changing any programs that access data using these interfaces. The lowest-level interface enables the calling program to add to the data base, update a value, or retrieve a value, in terms of a hierarchy position. The second-level interface facilitates traversal of a hierarchy by enabling the calling program to specify portions of the hierarchy over which a process is to operate. Such a specification, called an “access tree,” consists of data which can be generated at execution time by the calling routine. As in the first level, data are transferred one at a time. The third-level interface is a function evaluation mechanism which computes values from data base values and other computed values according to function definitions passed to it at execution time. Like an access tree, a function definition is itself data which can be constructed at execution time by the client process."
"The natural dialogue system (NDS) is a software system designed to permit the easy implementation of time-shared computer programs which employ sophisticated forms of man-machine dialogue to converse with members of a nonprogrammer user audience. The heart of the system is a syntax-directed translator which recognizes user input messages and translates them into an internal text of integers for use by the program. NDS allows the language designer to specify the syntax of the statements in his language, the form of their translations, methods for diagnosing errors in user's input, diagnostic messages to be generated, and the style of dialogue which will exist between the programs and their users. This is accomplished through a dialogue description and a language description consisting of syntactic specification elements with semantic procedures embedded within them. Use of NDS allows the language designer to produce an interactive language which is tailor-made for both his users and his programs. NDS relieves the language designer of the necessity of writing a complex message analyzer, thereby substantially reducing the effort required to produce systems that offer these forms of man-machine dialogue. Furthermore, use of NDS allows such systems to be implemented by less sophisticated programming talent than would otherwise be necessary."
"The Off-The-Shelf System (OTSS) is a packaged information management system for hierarchical data bases. OTSS provides, without computer programming, processes to enter and alter data in such a data base, do complex retrievals of data from the data base, and specify various security mechanisms to limit access to, or alteration of, a data base. OTSS also provides a mechanism for extending the available processes on a project-by-project basis. OTSS has been implemented using MASTER LINKS and the NATURAL DIALOGUE SYSTEM."
"The potentials and fields in a two-dimensional model of a charge-coupled device (CCD) are studied. We assume no mobile minority carriers have been injected into the CCD and that the electrode voltages do not vary with time. The nonlinear equations describing the devices are first linearized using the depletion layer approximation. The linearized equations are then solved approximately by a fitting technique. Both surface and buried channel CCD's are considered. The accuracy and cost of obtaining the solution is discussed. This work is a continuation of a study initiated in an earlier paper.1"
"We calculate the probability of error in detecting digital signals transferred through a charge transfer device in the presence of incomplete charge transfer, random noise in the device, and detection uncertainty in the detector. The coefficient of incomplete charge transfer is assumed to be independent of charge-packet size, and both the device noise and detector noise are assumed to be Gaussian. Error probabilities for two-level and four-level codes are computed for the cases of both simple static and optimum dynamic detection. For rms detection voltage level fluctuations Vd of the order of tenths of volts (much larger than the random noise fluctuations in the device), a very rapid increase in error probability (from ≍ 10−20 to ≍ 10−5) is found to occur for a very small (20 percent) change in Vd. This indicates that detection level fluctuations will have to be held down to a few hundred millivolts at most. To achieve equal error rates with an error probability of about 10−14, Vd for the detection of four-level codes will have to be about 3.5 times smaller than for two-level codes. Comparison of error probabilities under static and dynamic detection shows that in CTD's improved detection has a greater potential for reducing error rates than improved coding."
"Because of its theoretical and practical interest, the stability problem in pulse-width-modulated feedback systems has received an enormous amount of attention. Much of the reported literature deals with highly approximate methods, and the exact approaches, based on Lyapunov's direct method or functional analysis, are quite restrictive and do not easily lend themselves to systematic compensation or design. In this paper, a quite general PWM is considered, and a frequency domain stability criterion is presented, yielding a geometric interpretation in the Popov plane."
"Decision feedback equalization is presently of interest as a technique for reducing intersymbol interference in high-rate PAM data communications systems. The basic principle is to cancel out intersymbol interference arising from previously decided data symbols at the receiver, leaving remaining intersymbol interference components to be handled by linear equalization. In this work we consider the application of decision feedback equalization to quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM) transmission, in which two independent information streams modulate quadrature carriers. Extending Salz's treatment in a companion paper of decision feedback for a baseband channel, we derive the form of the optimum receiver filters via a matrix Wiener-Hopf analysis. We obtain explicit analytical expressions for minimum mean-square error and optimum transmitting filters. The optimization is subject to a constraint on the transmitted signal power and assumes no prior decision errors. The class of QAM transmitter and receiver structures treated here is actually much larger than the class usually considered for QAM systems. However, our results for decision feedback equalization show that, for nonexcess bandwidth systems, optimum performance is achievable without taking advantage of the most general structure. If the transmitter is required to have the conventional QAM structure, study of the time continuous system that gives rise to the sampled data system considered here demonstrates that under quite general assumptions a nonexcess bandwidth system is optimum. Finally, the explicit description of the optimum transmitting matrix filter follows from an information-theoretic “water-pouring” algorithm in conjunction with the determination of the form of the points of maxima of a determinant extremal problem."
"Analyses in the literature of digital communications often presuppose that the digital source is “white,” that is, that it produces stochastically independent equiprobable symbols. In this paper we show that it is possible to “whiten” to any degree all the first- and second-order statistics of any binary source at the cost of an arbitrarily small controllable error rate. Specifically, we prove that the self-synchronizing digital data scrambler, already shown effective at scrambling strictly periodic data sources, will scramble any binary source to an arbitrarily small first- and second-order probability density imbalance δ if (i) the source is first passed through the equivalent of a symmetric memoryless channel with an arbitrarily small but nonzero error probability ∊, and (ii) the scrambler contains M stages where Some interpretations and applications of this result are included."
"The additional optical power required at the repeater input in a fiber optic communication system due to intersymbol interference is experimentally measured. In the experiment, the intersymbol interference which results from differential mode delay in multimode fibers is minimized with a five-tap transversal equalizer. Error rate measurements are performed using five fibers ranging from 0.01 km to 1.25 km in length. In this manner, the additional optical power required to achieve a given error rate is found as a function of pulse width. The measured values compare favorably with the power penalties predicted by Personick. The trade-off between excess optical power and equalization penalty in dispersion-limited fiber systems is discussed."
"Measurements of phase and amplitude dispersion over a 20-MHz band have been made on a 42-km, 6-GHz, line-of-sight microwave link. A novel technique is introduced for measuring the phase dispersion induced by the propagation path. Specifically, the amplitudes and relative phases of four tones separated equally by 6.6 MHz have been continuously monitored over a period of four months. The data show that there is usually measurable (0.02 degree/(MHz)2) phase distortion over the 20-MHz band during those fades whose depth exceeds about 20 dB. These dispersive fades, which usually last a few seconds, typically occur along with shallow and essentially nondispersive fades that have durations of several minutes. However, only the dispersive fades exhibit a phase nonlinearity. Analysis of 16 events measured in the autumn of 1970 yield the following results. (i) The distribution curve describing the fraction of time that phase nonlinearity (quadratic) exceeds a given value follows a lognormal distribution. (ii) The quadratic phase nonlinear coefficient exceeds an average value of 0.1 degree/(MHz)2 for fades with depth larger than 34 dB from the nominal level. This corresponds to a time delay distortion of 0.55 nanosecond over 1-MHz band. (iii) The correlation between log-amplitude and phase nonlinear coefficients yields a correlation coefficient whose magnitude is fade-depth dependent and whose sign varies from event to event. The experimental technique of measuring phase dispersion reported here may be of interest not only for propagation studies but also in other systems such as measurement of characteristics of electrical networks. The statistical results obtained on the phase characteristics may prove of interest in formulating an analytical model. Further, they may be of significance in the design of existing and future microwave systems."
 "In a recent note1 calculated results of differential attenuation and differential phase shift, as a function of rain rate, were given at frequencies of 4, 18.1, and 30 GHz. The calculations have since been done at 11 GHz also. These results are based on scattering of a plane electromagnetic wave by oblate spheroidal raindrops. The point matching procedure used to obtain nonperturbative solutions to the problem was briefly described, and full details will be presented later.2 Somewhat similar calculations have been carried out by Oguchi2 at 19.3 and 34.8 GHz."
 "Although a great deal is known about design techniques for optimum (in a minimax error sense) finite impulse response (FIR) low-pass digital filters, there have not been established any practical design rules for such filters. Thus, a user is unable to easily decide on the (approximate or exact) filter order required to meet his design specifications and must resort to tables or trial and error procedures. In this paper, such a set of design rules is given. In the case of very narrow bandwidth or very wide bandwidth filters, analytic relations between the filter parameters can be readily obtained. In all other cases, exceedingly good linear and nonlinear fits to the data can be obtained over somewhat restricted ranges of the parameters. These fitting procedures lead to a practical set of simple design rules for estimating filter order from the desired specifications."
"Loss, coupling, and delay differences among the modes of multimode fibers influence their response to intensity-modulated optical signals. This “baseband” response is derived here from a time-dependent continuous description of the power flow in the fiber. Particular attention is given to the output as a function of angle and to the impulse response, its width and symmetry. We find that coupling narrows the impulse response but, at the same time, causes additional loss. Under practical conditions, this loss may limit the usefulness of coupling for the purpose of reducing the mode dispersion. We calculate a possible data rate of 12 Mb/s for a 10-km repeater spacing and an effective numerical aperture of 0.1, but we show that further improvements can be gained from an optimization of the coupling characteristic and of other parameters."
"This paper presents a comprehensive theory of mode coupling in optical fibers with imperfections. The paper begins with the derivation of a general coupled wave theory based on the modes of the ideal fiber. The general theory is applied to a simplified description of guided and radiation modes of the fiber that is valid for small core-cladding index differences. The simplified theory results in expressions for the coupling coefficients that are nearly as simple as those of the slab waveguide. As an example, the theory is applied to the calculation of radiation losses caused by pure core diameter changes and by elliptical deformations of the fiber core."
"This paper is concerned with a systematic approach to the design of the “linear channel” of a repeater for a digital fiber optic communication system. In particular, it is concerned with how one properly chooses the front-end preamplifier and biasing circuitry for the photodetector; and how the required power to achieve a desired error rate varies with the bit rate, the received optical pulse shape, and the desired baseband-equalized output pulse shape. It is shown that a proper front-end design incorporates a high-impedance preamplifier which tends to integrate the detector output. This must be followed by proper equalization in the later stages of the linear channel. The baseband signal-to-noise ratio is calculated as a function of the preamplifier parameters. Such a design provides significant reduction in the required optical power and/or required avalanche gain when compared to a design which does not integrate initially. It is shown that, when the received optical pulses overlap and when the optical channel is behaving linearly in power,1 baseband equalization can be used to separate the pulses with a practical but significant increase in required optical power. This required power penalty is calculated as a function of the input and equalized pulse shapes."
"This paper applies the results of Part I to specific receivers in order to obtain numerical results. The general explicit formulas for the required optical average power to achieve a desired error rate are summarized. A specific receiver is considered and the optical power requirements solved for. The parameters defining this receiver (e.g., bit rate, bias resistance, dark current, etc.) are then varied, and the effects on the required optical power are plotted."
"The properties of modes in a slab structure with gain in the center region and loss in the surrounding medium are investigated. The propagation constant and field distribution of the lowest-order modes are determined. The cutoff frequencies and propagation constants of the next-higher mode are given. Furthermore, the effect of a refractive index depression or increase in the center region is determined. The depression does not destroy the mode, as may be expected, but causes it to have a cutoff frequency. Comparison of these results to the experimental data shows that gain-induced modes play an important part in the lateral confinement in stripe-geometry GaAs lasers."
"The trend in electronic circuit design is toward increasing power dissipation density. The performance and reliability of increasing number of electronic systems are now seriously threatened by thermal effects, so that it is necessary to reappraise the relevant thermal design procedures. This paper examines natural convection cooling and concerns the prediction of maximum temperatures of electronic cabinets containing arrays of vertically oriented circuit cards with unequal power dissipation levels. By means of a vertical channel model, the effects of channel spacing, channel height, and power dissipation level are assessed with emphasis on asymmetric powering of the channel walls. Methods are indicated for rapid evaluation of maximum temperatures and optimum channel spacing with asymmetric heating. The present results show that asymmetry reduces the thermal performance of the channel. Consequently, the power dissipation on the channel walls should be made nearly equal."
"A long-standing communications problem is the efficient coding of a block of binary data into a pair of in-phase and quadrature components. This modulation technique may be regarded as the placing of a discrete number of signal points in two dimensions. Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and combined amplitude and phase modulation (AM-PM) are two familiar examples of this signaling format. Subject to a peak or average power constraint, the selection of the signal coordinates is done so as to minimize the probability of error. In the design of high-speed data communication systems this problem becomes one of great practical significance since the dense packing of signal points reduces the margin against Gaussian noise. Phase jitter, which tends to perturb the angular location of the transmitted signal point, further degrades the error rate. Previous investigations have considered the signal evaluation and design problem in the presence of Gaussian noise alone and within the framework of a particular structure, such as conventional amplitude and phase modulation. We present techniques to evaluate and optimize the choice of a signal constellation in the presence of both Gaussian noise and carrier phase jitter. The performance of a number of currently used or proposed signal constellations are compared. The evaluation and the optimization are based upon a perturbation analysis of the probability density of the received signal given the transmitted signal. Laplace's asymptotic formula is used for the evaluation. Discretizing the signal space reduces the optimal signal design problem under a peak power constraint to a tractable mathematical programming problem. Our results indicate that in Gaussian noise alone an improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of as much as 2 dB may be realized by using quadrature amplitude modulation instead of conventional amplitude and phase modulation. New modulation formats are proposed which perform very well in Gaussian noise and additionally are quite insensitive to moderate amounts of phase jitter."
"A theory of traffic-measurement errors for loss systems with renewal input is developed. The results provide an accurate approximation for the variance of any differentiable function of one or more of the following basic traffic measurements taken during a given time interval: (i) The total number of attempts (peg count) (ii) The number of unsuccessful attempts (overflow count) (iii) The usage based on discrete samples (TUR measurement) or on continuous scan. The approximation is given in terms of the individual variances and covariance functions of the three measurements. Asymptotic approximations for these moments are obtained using the concept of a generalized renewal process, and are shown to be sufficiently accurate for telephone traffic-engineering purposes. As an application of the theory, we examine the variances of the standard estimates of the load and peakedness (variance-to-mean ratio) of an input traffic stream for a time interval of one hour. Other possible applications to Bell System trunking problems are discussed."
"An array of shift registers that may operate in two orthogonal directions can be called a planar shifting array. This article shows how two basic building blocks, fashioned from planar shifting arrays, may be interconnected to form a time-division switching network of arbitrary size. The characteristics of magnetic bubble and charge-coupled devices are compatible with the concept of planar arrays, and it is in these emerging technologies that switching networks of planar shifting arrays may become practical."
"This paper studies charge distribution in buried-channel charge-coupled devices. Detailed development of a one-dimensional electrostatic model is presented and a numerical solution of the resulting nonlinear potential equations is described. Graphical results show the charge-filling mechanism and the relationship between the oxide-semiconductor interface potential and total free positive charge."

"Power electronics is a technology which is interstitial to all three of the major disciplines of electrical engineering: electronics, power, and control. Yet its rapidly expanding significance has not been widely recognized, and the historical parochialism of specialists within the technology has stifled communication and cooperation in solving increasingly challenging problems. This paper calls for an end to this parochialism, leading to the emergence of an important new discipline and profession."

"Spacecraft electrical power subsystems require continuous monitoring, ground supported analysis of performance, and ground intervention to provide power management and fault correction. An interplanetary fly-by mission to the outer planets necessitates long periods of relatively low activity between encounters. It would be desirable to minimize ground access and support during these times if it can be shown that power management and fault removal functions can be implemented economically and reliably within the power subsystem flight equipment. This paper describes the interim results of a study to develop the techniques and implementation methods to provide a power subsystem capable of autonomous fault correction and power management. Each subsystem element is analyzed to define failure modes and failure characteristics which permit identification of fault correction methods. Fault protection concepts for each classification of loads are formulated to provide a high probability of delivering power to the load yet protect the power subsystem in the event of a load fault. The Mariner Jupiter/Saturn power subsystem elements formed the baseline for this study."
"Spacecraft electrical systems must satisfy a demand for short duration pulses and long term or dc levels as the spacecrafts electronic equipment is operated. During these operational periods, the spacecraft bus undergoes wide variations in power demand which can cause voltage fluctuations and out of specification conditions to occur if adequate design provisions are not incorporated. This paper describes the power subsystem of the Radiometer/Scatterometer/Altimeter Experiment for Skylab 1, and the design implemented to provide a high quality bus to supply widely varying power demands. Some of the load conditions considered include initial turn-on of power and the associated inrush current; low frequency operation of a traveling wave tube; bursts of calibration pulses; periodic high power radar pulsing; waveguide switch operation; antenna gimbal slewing; and heater control circuitry to provide constant temperature. Power processing circuits are also discussed, including a pulse-width modulated voltage regulator, dc-to-dc conversion for isolation, and additional converters to provide various voltage levels."
"The initial spacecraft of the Earth Resources Technology Satellite Program, ERTS-1, was launched on July 23, 1972, and has provided broad earth resource data for use by numerous governmental and scientific agencies. This paper reports on the basic design and flight performance to date of the ERTS-1 power system. The design is based on earlier Nimbus spacecraft power system configurations with modifications introduced to provide increases in average and peak power capabilities. Data is presented showing overall design performance in terms of allowable load duty cycles, solar array capability, and battery charge and discharge behavior. Of special interest is the effect of solar flare activity occurring on August 3 to 7, 1972, in abruptly reducing the solar array output. After 10 months in orbit sufficient power remains for another 18 months of ERTS operation."
"The successful application of decentralized power processing to several large-scale systems at Hughes Aircraft Company is described in this report. Tradeoff studies, performance results and circuit examples are summarized; also included are the results of studies regarding the selection of ac versus dc link for the distribution of power to the using electronic units. Problem areas and suggestions for further activity are included."
"Spacecraft power systems utilizing radioisotope thermoelectric generators CRTGs) as primary power sources present an uncommon set of require ments and limitations for interfacing dc-to-dc converters. A converter configuration is presented that complements these RTG characteristics. The circuit is a variation of the basic flyback regulator modified to provide input regulation. The converter has two isolated outputs. One output provides power directly to the spacecraft equipment, while the second is used for battery charging. Design problems addressed are noise generation in long cable lengths between the RTG source and the converter, regulation of the converter input to obtain maximum power transfer from the RTG to the equipment, and provision for two converter outputs while maintaining high efficiency with a simple design implementation. The design of a converter and battery charger used on the Viking Lander Capsule* is presented as an illustration."
"This paper discusses methods of generating high voltage waveforms (up to several thousand volts) at modest power levels (several ten's of watts). The circuit techniques and system configurations which involve Parallel Series Chains (PSC) of Light Triggered Bilateral Switches (LTBS) are new and employ all solid state components. The circuit and system techniques discussed show how small, light weight, highly efficient, programmable power systems can be built to satisfy a wide variety of applications and should be particularly interesting to those designing high performance and/or portable power systems."
"Provides a summary of the conference session."
"Two models are discussed which can be used to predict both forward and reverse second breakdown limits. The thermal model, which applies to forward second breakdown, includes the effects of base and emitter ballasting. The electrical model is most applicable to the case of reverse second breakdown and is based on the mechanism of avalanche injection. Good agreement between the predictions of the models and experimental measurements is demonstrated. Emphasis is placed on those results which are likely to be of importance to the device user."
"This paper discusses a quantitative design theory and new analysis techniques applicable to saturated switching power transistors. Methods for discriminating among various possible current-gain falloff mechanisms at high current densities are discussed in terms of easily measurable quantities allowing separation of the terminal currents in to physically meaningful components. The new analytical and experimental techniques presented allow rapidanalysis of any high current power transistor, allow characterization of various process sequences for their effects upon device performance, and allow optimal quantitative transistor design for a wide range of applications."
"An improved model is introduced to represent NN+-P-v-N+ high-voltage power switching transistors. This model differs from the conventional Ebers-Moll model in three major respects: (1) a non-linear collector resistance is included to account for conductivity modulation in the collector region; (2) the forward current gain is made to depend on VCE as well as Ic so as to account for the Early effect; (3) a multisection network representation of the ambipolar diffusion equation is used to account for the effects of stored charge in the collector region particularly when the device operates in the quasi-saturation condition. The correlation of this model with observed D.C. and switching behavior is notably better than that of the Ebers-Moll model."
"Improved understanding of the design and operation of these devices has led to the successful development of a new generation of high power gate controlled switches. The devices reported here have an 800 volt forward blocking capability. The forward drop is less than 1.7 volts at 100 amperes and the devices turn-off 100 amperes in about 1 microsecond. Testing techniques and procedures have been developed to fully characterize these devices and to provide an understanding of the effect of various circuit conditions on switching performance. These advancements greatly extend the potential use fulness of gate controlled switches in power electronics applications."
"An SCR structure is provided with an anodegate which is used to speed up the device recovery and reduce it s turn-off time. The turn-off process of the \"Anode-Gate SCR\" is analyzed using the charge control approach. Experimental devices are described and the results of measurements are reported."
"Summary form only as given. Provides a summary of the conference session."
"Lower bounds are established for the power dissipated, peak voltage, and peak current for the switches and diodes in any dc-to-dc converter. The bounds are in terms of the input and output voltages and currents of the converter. A trade-off between peak voltage and peak current in a switch is shown to be theoretically possible. Realization of the trade-off in practice is illustrated by considering eleven different converter circuits."
"One of the important practical considerations in using static dc to square-wave inverters such as the circuit shown in Fig. 1 is the reliable starting of oscillations. It is generally known that inverters of this type are not self-starting under relatively heavy load conditions. Starting under load generally is achieved through an externally added starting circuit. A variety of starting circuits have been reported from time to time in the technical literature, e.g., Ref. 1, 2 and 3. Such circuits constitute an important ingredient in many of today's state-of-the-art power processing systems. The present paper analyzes various starting circuits from the point of view of nonlinear circuit theory. The results of this analysis provide guidance in the design and selection of starting circuits and lead to a better understanding of the rather large class of inverters (4) which have circuit configurations similar to that shown in Fig. 1."
"Analytic expressions for the small-signal power-stage describing functions of a switched dc-dc boost regulator are derived from an approximate continuous circuit model which is developed by a time-averaging technique. Closed-loop stability is, attained through the design of frequency compensation of the loop gain. Open- and closed-loop regulator output impedances are derived from the linearized models for the given configuration. The analysis and design are compared with and confirmed by breadboard measurements."
"A switching regulator or a switching-mode amplifier, dc/dc converter, or dc/ac inverter can have a negative dynamic input resistance at the dc power input port. Frequently an LC decoupling filter is inserted in the dc power line between this equipment and the prime dc power source, to keep switching transients off the dc power buss. The negative input resistance of the equipment can exceed the positive output resistance of the LC filter and the power source. Then the system as a whole can oscillate. This oscillation can cause malfunction of the negative-resistance equipnent or of other types of equipment which may also be operated from the prime source. The conditions required for oscillation to take place are defined, and ways are shown to prevent the oscillation. The predicted oscillations have been observed experimentally."
"Power switching circuits, using thyristors and diodes are divided into three categories based on the degree to which the load voltages and the states of the switching devices are known before starting the analysis. A number of techniques to obtain the steady-state and transient results are described and several applications to the three circuit classes are shown."
"The local dynamic stability of a PWM buck regulator has been investigated theoretically for the continuous conducting mode and with the aid of an analogue computer simulation for the discontinuous one. A parametric study of the main factors influencing the design and the stability of the control loop has been performed. The discontinuous conducting mode appears to be the most promising."
"Provides a summary of the conference session."
"This paper describes a scheme for controlling ac power by non-mechanical means. An electronic relay is implemented utilizing photon flux, rather than magnetic flux, as the coupling agency between the input and output terminals. In order to ndnimize electromagnetic interference (EMI), relay actuation is only permitted during the zero voltage excursions of the ac source. A triac functions as the output contacts."
"A hybrid microelectronics solid state relay was developed in a TO-116 package for the MINX project. The relay provides 2500 Vdc input to output isolation and operated from a MHTL logic signal to switch a load of 400 Vdc at 2 mA. The relay is designed to operate in space and survive 1000 thermal cycles of -120° C to 80° C. The use of X-rays for failure analysis in small hybrid circuits proved valuable and the applications of vacuum deposited Parylene1 as a dielectric coating proved extremely valuable."
"A feasibility study to design and demonstrate solid-state switch gear composed of circuit breakers and a power transfer switch is described. The switch gear operates on a nominal 270 Vdc circuit and controls power to a load up to 1 5 amperes. One circuit breaker may be interconnected to a second to form a power transfer switch. Breaker or switch on-off and transfer functions can be remotely controlled. Automatic overload trip-out is provided through an ultimate current trip and an I2t trip for transient overcrrents lower than the ultimate current trip level. A number of reclosure swith variable time delay between trip—out and reclosure are programmed and controlled by integrated analog and COSMOS logic circuits. A commutation circuit that creates minimal transient disturbances to either source or load was developed to interrupt current flow through the main SCR switching element. Laboratory tests demonstrated performance of solid-state circuit breaker (SSCB) specified voltage and temperature ranges."
"A series of electronic controllers using power SCR1s has been developed and tested for use in controlling variable-speed reluctance motors from a fixed-voltage direct-current source. The series commutated SCR1s are operated in a pulse mode compatable with the restrictions of the reluctance machine. The motor-controller system is capable of both motoring and regenerating operation. The controllers have been designed to control both the magnitude and the pulse width of the output current pulse over a wide range of pulse frequency. The controllers have been tested at power levels up to 20 H.P. and controller efficiency has been accurately measured using electronic-multiplier wattmeters. The theory of the power circuit has been, developed including the derivation of current wave forms with time-varying inductance loads."
"The \"Ferro and Regulator Replacement\" (FARR) power supply is characterized by its ability to maintain a constant d-c output voltage with variations in the power line input, such as during a \"brownout\" condition. Two modeling techniques were used to evaluate design features and performance. The primary method of analysis is a computer simulation model of the representative circuits. This simulation adequately represents the FARR power supply for both steady state and transient power supply operations. Auxiliary analytical models were also programmed to determine ideal signal waveforms and circuit values required to compensate for dynamic behavior under various power line conditions. Results obtained from the analytical models were tested in the more realistic simulation model. This paper emphasizes the methodology used to analyze and evaluate the FARR power supply."
"A hybrid mathematical/graphical technique for quick determination of instantaneous voltages on components in two types of adjustable current input (ACI) inverters feeding a standard induction motor is presented with practical examples. A comparison between the synthesized voltage waveforms of the two inverter types, auxiliary thyristor and autocommutated, reveals better overall performance for the auto-commutated inverter."
"Provides a summary of the conference session."
"Modem high power spacecraft operating in near earth orbit require efficient switching regulation in both battery charge and discharge control. In the past, the charge and discharge functions have been performed by separate power conditioners with separate power inductors, power filter capacitors, as well as separate duty cycle control modulators. In an effort to reduce weight, complexity, cost, and improve efficiency, a unique bilateral power conditioner was conceived. This system effectively minimizes part count, weight, and complexity as well as increasing reliability by utilizing common filters and control circuits for both the charge and discharge functions. A description of the requirements, development, circuit operation, circuit comparisons, and performance of the system is presented in this paper."
"This Static Inverter produces a true stepped waveform from a direct current source, which is symmetrical from one half cycle to the next half cycle. Because of its low output impedance and OC half-wave circulating path for current, the Inverter will deliver rectified, non-linear loads and still operate normally (low distortion) and under extremely poor power factor loads. The method used to obtain this type of stepped waveform was originally developed in 1965. With the advent of integrated circuits, the complexity and cost of the design was considerably reduced. Production of the eight steps of the waveform previously required eight separate volt· age generating sources. Today, through the use of integrated circuits, two or three voltage sources can perform the necessary function of producing eight to twenty-six (or more) steps if desired in a half wave cycle period. Only a fraction of the power (7%) is switched at a high frequency rate as compared with a Pulse Width Modulated technique. The bulk of the power (70%) is generated at the output frequency. The method of inversion discussed here can generate a high quality, high power sine wave voltage that meets most of the desirable character· istics of a high-quality inverter including low output impedance."
"A rational method for using switching circuits to produce precision three-phase sine wave power from dc or ac power sources has been developed. A three-phase sine wave format is considered to be composed of voltage segments consisting of stepped waves and square waves generated by separate circuits and combined on a threephase line to produce voltage waveforms with a total harmonic content of 4% prior to filtering. The stepped portions of the wave, called X and Y functions, are generated by a tapped autotransformer and appropriate switches. Only about 20% of the power is generated in the form of steps. A simple circuit that generates a square wave voltage called the \"center\" function, handles more than 80% of the inverter power. The inverter has the following characteristics: high input power factor (typically 0.9 to 0.95); low output impedance; can energize nonlinear loads without significant change in total harmonic content; and easy to parallel because of low energy storage in the output filter. The inverter has an efficiency of 88-93% and weighs about 120 lb (breadboard). Power rating is 10 k W with 200% overload capacity and output frequency is 60 or 400 Hz."
"Standardized.control and interface circuits were applied to the three most commonly used dc to dc converters: the buck-boost converter, the seriesswitching buck regulator, and the pulse-modulated paral1el inverter. The two-loop ASDTIC regulation control concept was implemented by using a common Analog Control Signal Processor (ACSP) and a novel Digital Control Signal Processor (DCSP). This resulted in control circuit standardization and superior static and dynamic performance of the three dc to dc converters. Power components stress control, through active peak current limiting and recovery of switching losses, was applied to enhance reliability and converter efficiency."
"A wide variety of power converters of the transformer-coupled push-pull type uses pulse-width modulation for output regulation. In designing and operating such converters, serious complications usually arise as a result of unsymmetrical switching of the two power transistors. Asymmetrical switching, caused by small parameter dissymmetries of these transistors, normally drives the transformer into saturation. Resulting excessive saturation currents reduce efficiency and put a severe strain on the power transistors, which can eventually cause circuit failure. This paper presents a new pulse-width modulator circuit which can be advantageously utilized in the design of such converters, and which can effectively cope with the above mentioned symmetry problem. Syrnmetry correction is accomplished by monitoring the two primary currents and by providing proper feedback of the integrated difference between these two currents."

"At present Texas Instruments is manufacturing three device types, TIXH807, TIXH808 and TIXH809, with a dual switching power of 100V x 150A, 100V x 200A, and 400V x 60A. These power modules make use of plastic devices manufactured on automated production lines. Therefore it is expected that the price for the Integrated Power Switch follows a learning curve consistant with the majority of semiconductor products. The enclosed picture shows the industrial TIXH807 Integrated Power Switch with a flange to be bolted to a heat sink. The two packages with through holes are intended for military applications. Only two bolts through a military module are used for ease of installation."
"An Electronic Power conditioner (EPC) for ESRO's 11 Ghz travelling Wave Tube (TWT) is presented. Key aspects of the design and development of the unit as well as results obtained are briefly given."
   "Experiments are described which isolate the causes for excessive “five o'clock shadow” and dark synthetic wigs which appear blond when viewed on present Bell System visual telephone (PICTUREPHONE®) station sets. Experimental data on the spectral reflectance of hair, skin, synthetic wigs and shaven male beards, as taken from the existing literature and from measurements in our laboratory, are presented in order to explain these effects. An optical filter is suggested which corrects both the shadow and wig problems simultaneously, but at the expense of camera sensitivity."
"The use of automatic black-level control circuitry on the telecine cameras examined is often detrimental to the reproduction of color motion-picture films by television. The result of this procedure is that the darkest area of every scene is forced to become black. This effect has been noted to varying degrees in all scenes and is relatively independent of film contrast of the photographic system. Present automatic black-level control on these telecine cameras makes difficult the design of an optimum film for television. Telecine operation using a preadjusted unattended manual black control on these cameras provides improved reproduction of the average color film."
"Observers judged the quality of the display of 63 different color film commercials as a function of the black-level control used. For two commonly used telecine cameras, use of the standard automatic black-level (ABL) mode resulted in a significant reduction in picture quality, compared with use of the manual mode, unattended (UMB). Excessive picture contrast and loss of shadow detail, as well as occasional darkening of middle tones, were observed. A change in ABL circuitry in one camera resulted in some improvement. A test of a newer camera showed that the ABL circuitry in that camera did not degrade picture quality. As a result of this test it is suggested that, if the telecine camera is properly set up, use of the unattended manual black mode should be considered in preference to use of ABL control."
"Recent advances in the quality of television film and telecine systems have raised questions about the usefulness of the automatic black level (ABL) control in telecine. This paper discusses the limitation as well as some advantages of using automatic black level control. The effects of the average picture level, optical flare and the attack time of the automatic black-level detector upon black level accuracy are demonstrated. It is shown that black compression occurring in the automatic mode can be reduced by decreasing the attack time of the black level detector."
"In making motion-picture prints in color, the scene-to-scene color and intensity modulators (vanes in the Light Valve System) respond to a punched-paper control tape in accordance with pre-programed information obtained through color timing procedures. Any error in any one of the vanes may cause a mislight or unbalance in the intensity and color of the particular scene being printed. In order to monitor any inaccurate positions of the light modulating vane, an automatic On-Line Computerized Vane Checking System has been developed. In this system the actual angular position of each light-controlling vane is monitored and compared to a standard that is in the computer memory system. Any out-of-tolerance deviation between the desired vane position and actual position starts an automatic computer procedure resulting in a stop of the printing machine and immediate identification of the error. The system consists of electromechanical sensing equipment attached to the light vanes with signal conditioning circuitry, reader interfacing and multiplex interfacing between the film printing machine and the IBM System/7 sensor-based computer."
"The Association for Educational Communications and Technology supports the activities of the International Electro-technical Commission by providing necessary travel and communication expenses for the SC 60C Chairman, Raymond Wyman, University of Massachusetts, during his three-year term of office. Secretariat support for the Subcommittee is provided by the Netherlands National Committee and the Secretary is Wim Koeter, N.V. Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken, IIIG/ELA SAN 4, Eindhoven, The Netherlands. United States participation is formulated and guided by an Advisory Committee chaired by Herbert E. Farmer, University of Southern California, Division of Cinema, University Park, Los Angeles, CA 90007. Responsible for Assn. for Educational Communications and Technology liaison is Richard Nibeck, AECT, 1201 16th St., Washington, DC 20036. Suggestions for the work of this Committee will be welcomed by Messrs. Farmer or Nibeck or Dr. Wyman whose address appears in the footnote below. The first report of this Committee was published on p. 617 of the August 1972 Journal."
"From the opening address by Sir John Eden, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, to the Friday evening banquet, it was apparent that the President of BKSTS, B. J. Davies, together with Conference Chairman R. R. E. Pulman and the Conference Committee, had achieved a well-balanced program of papers, technical visits and exhibits to meet the varied interests of more than 1,000 registrants from 30 countries."
                    "In the summer of 1972, the relatively new station of KDUB-TV in Dubuque, Iowa, as part of a test program made a complete change to super 8 for both news and commercial production. Since that time, well over 85,000 ft (25,500 m) of super 8 have been processed, edited and aired at the station's facilities. All three formats (super-8, single-8 and double super-8) have been tested. About 90% of the film used was Kodak Ektachrome EF film 7242 (available in cartridges), double super 8 and prestriped single strand; however, other film stocks were tested, including Kodachrome II movie film (Type A) KA, Kodak Ektachrome 40 movie film (Type A) EMA and Kodak Ektachrome 160 movie film (Type A) ELA. Findings of the test program brought out a critical need for image enhancement with super 8 and also brought out the considerable savings resulting from the use of super-8 film, especially in shipping costs."
"Super 8 is rapidly becoming a professional filmmaking medium. The producer's needs for this format are briefly considered. Special printing equipment has been developed and is described in some detail. The required precision, when preparing super-8 originals for printing, is discussed and splicing strictures are illustrated. Printing methods in accordance with the producer's requirements are described. Accessory equipment, such as title stands and other devices are now also available. Wet-gate techniques have been successfully applied in super-8/16mm blowup equipment. There are available numerous optical effects. A brief look into super-8's future is given."
"Related to a list of basic concepts a super-8 printing system has been designed for continuous 16–8mm reduction on dual-rank 8mm rawstock at high printing speed. Although the mechanics are similar to a printer described earlier, changes to produce high-quality super-8 prints have included a new lamp, a continuous rawstock feed system, and large loop trees for both picture and separately for magnetic sound. These permit long periods of operation to make an entire print order."
"A continuous optical reduction printer for high-volume super-8 release printing from 16mm or 35–32mm internegatives is described. Design features, such as panel-type construction, common-shaft sprockets, air cleaning of the film, printer-output volume, illumination system, light and trim scales, optical lens and mirror system, field uniformity, type of single-speed motor drive, operating controls, constant-torque take-ups, etc., are discussed."
"Complex cyanides (ferrocyanide and ferricyanide) in industrial-waste water effluents impose a direct threat upon the environment. Methods to recover or destroy these compounds were evaluated in laboratory studies. The techniques tested include electrolysis, ozonation, chlorination and heavy metal ion precipitation. The study was conducted to determine the feasibility of using one or more of these methods to reduce the concentration of ferricyanide in both concentrated (10,000 to 100,000 mg/l) and dilute (10 to 100 mg/l) waste effluents. — Ferrocyanide can be oxidized to ferricyanide in overflow photographic color process bleaches using either electrolysis or ozone and the regenerated waste bleach recirculated for reuse in the process. Dilute concentrations of ferricyanide can be destroyed using ozone or chlorine under the proper conditions of temperature, pH and catalyst addition. A cost analysis was made for the methods that were judged acceptable for commercial use. Cost data for each procedure are based upon an “average combined” photographic processor."
"A portable multi-media rear-screen presentation was created for promotional purposes and has been shown to potential customers at luncheons serving about 250 guests. A 74- by 14-ft (22.5- by 4.3-m) rear-projection screen was constructed, to display 14 images of different sizes and shapes, projected by 16 Carousel slide projectors and one 16mm arc projector. The 14-minute presentation was programed on four Spindler & Sauppe Quadra Ques, used in tandem with a 4-track TEAC stereo tape unit. Three Spindler dissolve units and a variety of short focal length lenses were used. A special portable scaffolding was built to hold the series of projection units. The equipment was transported throughout the United States in a Dodge van and was set up in six hours by two projectionists."
"A survey, published in 1971, was conducted of the density and color balance of selected television films broadcast in 1968. From this work recommendations were made aimed at improving consistency in color balance of films intended for television. This second survey, made in 1972, shows that there has been an improvement in the consistency of color balance of television films, and a general improvement in the photographic quality of television entertainment films. However, these improvements are offset, particularly in the case of film commercials, by a tendency toward prints having insufficient density in important subject areas. An increase is noticed in the practice of introducing large, blank-white areas in the scene, which cause problems in the reproduction of these films on television."
"A high percentage of feature motion-picture films intended for theatrical release are produced in a format intended for a wide-screen presentation. For television transmission, a special print normally is provided wherein the film frame is masked to the narrower format. The masking is moved horizontally to follow picture information essential to the story. The system described herein accomplishes the scanning operation during real-time transfer of film to tape. An optical system, controlled automatically from recorded cues, moves the wide-screen image to specific horizontal positions relative to the camera aperture at the appropriate film frame. By the elimination of the film processing laboratory scanning operation and production of special prints, substantial cost savings are achieved in the transfer of a feature film program to the television format."
"The development of new systems of cinematography has resulted in a wide variety of image formats with different aspect ratios. Regardless of what format is used in taking the picture it is shown in all kinds of motion-picture equipment and on television. For converting films from one format to another appropriate procedures and equipment are available. However, the process of converting from format to format, particularly if selection of picture content is involved, results in a loss in the character of the composition, some reduction in the quality of the image, and a delay in the preparation of the material needed for the mass production of prints. — The authors here propose a universal format for the negative original which can then be used for printing positive copies in the required formats. The proposal advanced by the authors requires an overall evaluation and experimental verification. Because of the importance of decisions concerning the integration of image formats used in the production of film intended for cinematography and television, producers of films, film operators, and interested specialists are invited to participate in these discussions."
"For the first time since 1952, Technical Committee 36 on Cinematography of the International Standards Organization will be holding its Plenary Meeting in the United States. The Eighth Plenary Meeting of ISO/TC 36, tentatively scheduled to be held at the Cascades Conference Center in Colonial Williams-burg, Virginia, 10–17 December 1973, is expected to bring together leading motion-picture engineers from 18 nations which are substantially concerned in the production of motion-picture films."
                "The short-range effects on the motion-picture processing industry of Public Law 92–500 (Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972) are assessed. The goal of the Act is to see that all industries discharging wastes into navigable waters (1) by mid-1977 use the best practicable technology to reduce pollution, (2) by mid-1983 use the best available technology to further reduce pollution and (3) by 1985 eliminate the discharge of pollutants altogether into such waters. The motion-picture processing industry is seen to be in a good position to meet the 1977 standards with minimal economic dislocation; the later proposed standards are rather controversial and may be tested in the courts, so their potential impact is difficult to assess. It is likely, however, that pretreatment of effluents will be necessary before discharging them into municipal sewers. The sewer limits of 47 large municipalities are considered along with the Preliminary Interim Guidelines that affect the (rather similar) metal finishing industry. Financial assistance and tax incentives are widely available to meet the new standards, and sources are noted. Tables showing Environmental Protection Agency standards, rulings and actions with their effective dates are included."
"After a short historical survey the principles and general properties of the modern bleach-fixing bath are outlined. The main ingredients are the ferri-complex of ethylene diamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and hypo or ammonium thiosulfate. The EDTA bleach-fixing bath was introduced in the early 1950s by Agfa and Gevaert for the processing of color paper. In order to meet the ever-increasing demands for simpler, faster and cleaner processes, the application of the EDTA bleach-fixing bath in the processing of motion-picture color film, particularly the Gevacolor Print Film, has been examined recently. It has been found that with this bath these goals can readily be attained. The proposed shortened processing seems worthwhile from the practical, economic and ecological points of view. Practical solutions are proposed concerning the desilvering and regeneration of the used bleach-fixing bath."
"The video signal processing that takes place between the Plumbicons ™ and the Encoder in the Philips PC-100 color television camera is described. In this new system all of the video processing is done within the camera head; RF multiplexing of the video signals makes it possible to transmit two signals from the camera head over a new lightweight triaxial cable (one center conductor and two shields) to the camera control unit and one signal in the reverse direction. Monolithic integrated circuits, precision components and modern circuit techniques are used extensively for their advantages in compactness, weight and performance (particularly stability)."
"A degree of standardization of super-8 cartridge sound films has evolved in response to the purchasing power of the Department of Defense. The DOD elected in 1970 to purchase equipment only according to a standard (MIL STD 1354) based on three ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standards for super-8 film with magnetic sound and plus 18-frame sound sync. Military programs for recruiting and training were initiated to use new “MIL-STD compatible” equipment, for which Fairchild has supplied an engineering program."
"By modifying a pair of Sony AV3650 videotape recorders (VTRs), to operate synchronously in all modes and extending their capabilities beyond the normal record and playback functions, it has been possible to develop a system for editing videotape and thus produce low-cost video programs rapidly and of a quality not appreciably less than that obtainable with professional equipment. Among the features implemented are: single-switch operation of both machines; a driven reverse mode with positive tape take-up; a device eliminating double sound recording at the edit point; use of a number of time-delay relays automated operation; an audio dub system for re-recording sound without affecting the picture; and a system for superimposing titles. Additional improvements such as replacing the time-delay relays with electronic switching are possible."
"The Society's interests in current and future communications by satellites have been manifest on our technical conference programs and in numerous papers in the Journal. — In February 1972 there were, “Television Distribution by the Canadian Domestic Satellite System” by R. M. Lester; “Utilization of Domestic Satellites in the Networks of the CBC” by C. A. Siocos; and “Some Technical Considerations in Providing Television Coverage by Satellite” by J. F. D. Ball. The March 1972 Journal contained “Broadcasting From Satellites” by C. A. Siocos; “Broadcasting From Satellites — UHF Television Channel Utilization” by R. F. Zeitoun and C. A. Siocos; “Possible Technical Standards for Educational and Community Television by Satellite” by R. P. Haviland; and “Combined Educational and Television Network Satellite Distribution System” by Daniel R. Wells. In December 1972 there was “Apollo 15 and 16 Ground-Commanded Television Assembly” by Bert M. Soltoff. — In October 1972 a series of papers and discussions was held in Los Angeles as the Symposium on Communication Satellites and Cable Television; those papers will soon be published in the Journal. — In addition to the conventional applications related to commercial broadcasting other interesting possibilities are being investigated. Two experimental satellites, one by the U.S.A., the other Canadian, will be launched in 1974 and 1975, respectively, for experimental communication programs. New advances in traveling wave lube design are expected to simplify ground station design, lessen the size and increase mobility. We are privileged to present here, in slightly abridged form, a recent speech given by Robert W. Sarnoff on this subject. In it, he outlines some of the broad possibilities, difficulties and concerns for the future as we advance towards more simplified and efficient means of providing worldwide communication links.—Gerald G. Graham, Editorial Vice-President"
              "Digital television may effectively serve as the means to store, process and control color television signals within a broadcast plant. Pulse code modulation (PCM) involves the periodic amplitude sampling of a video signal and the conversion of each sample into a binary number of n bits. The PCM signal bit stream can be in n parallel channels or be time multiplexed into a single channel. In either case the total bit rate equals n times the encoding rate. We desire to minimize the bit rate in order to save circuit elements and bandwidth, consistent of course with acceptable picture quality. — A series of subjective tests was conducted to determine the importance of various parameters when PCM encoding an NTSC, 525-line, 60-field, composite television signal. Among these parameters are: (1) the number of amplitude levels being sampled that, in turn, define the n-bit digital word; (2) the encoding rate, both locked and unlocked with respect to the 3.58-MHz color subcarrier; and (3) the role of dither consisting of coherent square waves and weighted noise. The test setup consisted of a color film camera, encoding rate generators, dither generators, A/D and D/A converters, color and monochrome monitors. A test panel of experienced viewers examined the pictures in a controlled environment and rated each picture on a stepped acceptance scale. We concluded that NTSC television pictures that had been encoded with 6 or more bits per codeword suffered negligible impairment. The encode rate should be phase coherent with the color subcarrier in order to avoid beats in the picture. Dither signals did not make any improvement in picture quality except to mask contours during 4- or 5-bit encoding."
"The perceptibility of vertical unsteadiness in TV presentations was evaluated using still scenes (35mm slides) and moving scenes (16mm motion pictures) projected through a telecine chain. Sinusoidal disturbances having peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.1 to 1.0% of the image height, over a frequency range from 1.0 Hz to 15 Hz, were introduced into the televised scenes. Acceptability of the televised image was judged by an audience representing a cross section of Eastman Kodak Co. employees. The results demonstrate that the most critical frequencies are between 3 Hz and 6 Hz. At these frequencies, the audience rated image quality acceptable for unsteadiness amplitudes less than 0.2% peak-to-peak for still scenes and less than 0.3% peak-to-peak for moving scenes."
"Four new presentation control rooms have been built in Edmonton and Toronto utilizing the experience gained from recent automated installations. A standard layout and computer system is used in each. The data entry is from magnetic data cassettes rather than from punched cards used previously. Standard business-type cathode-ray-tube terminals are used to prepare and utilize the cassettes, giving an easy compatibility with administrative computers used off-line to process program data."
"In laboratory printing of color motion-picture film, the most critical factor in controlling light exposure is the intensity of each of the three primary colors; continuous monitoring and correction are needed. A printer control system is described which can utilize the mass of data obtained from the densitometric tests that are routinely prescribed. In this system, an analog/digital converter and an IBM System/7 process control computer are used to convert into adjustment values density information which has been read from control strips by a densitometer. The computer solves a matrix equation relating density and trim and automatically prints out the trim and voltage corrections needed on the film printing machines. Interlayer effects are taken into account, and sample densities are automatically compared to laboratory reference densities. Both accuracy and reliability of printer control are improved."
"Helical-path transports as they are usually designed for photographic processing machines can cause tracking problems because the film typically approaches the spools in a manner that makes it want to “walk” off the spools. This inherent problem can make the film path difficult to control. Also the flanges on the spools can cause edge damage on the product and generate “dirt.” For new machines where design flexibility is available, elimination of the helix is recommended for eliminating these problems. A design is suggested that will accomplish this but yet keep the general helical-path configuration. For existing transports, several tracking aids and techniques are suggested to minimize the tracking problem."
"While virtually all motion-picture productions intended for multiple copy release distribution currently employ 16mm and wider films for original cinematography, the 16 and 8mm Committee has noted increasing interest, experimentation and occasional production using super-8 format original camera films. It appears that further advances in sensitized materials, cameras, laboratory equipment and projectors will be necessary prior to major exploitation of this smaller-format medium. However, the potential need was noted for some kind of indexing system (corresponding to the “edge” or “footage” numbers on 16 and 35mm films) where super-8 originals are used. Accordingly an ad hoc Subcommittee was named to consider this question in behalf of the SMPTE and prepare a report for the 16 and 8mm Committee."
             "A systems-approach technique has been used in an attempt to integrate color television chains. Basic circuits that are elementary building blocks have been integrated and designated as Unit Integrated Circuits (UICs). By combining these UICs, video equipment such as TV cameras, videotape recorders and other studio equipment can be designed and integrated with a resultant reduction in design cost in view of mass production. Performances required for each UIC are specified on the basis of overall transmission characteristics. Optimum specification methods by means of a probabilistic method, based on the “law of addition” and “interchange of distortions” are described. This method achieves the required performance without deterioration of picture quality."
"A color television camera has been designed to be very small in size and light in weight by using only one tube for luminance and another for color signal pickup. Compactness has been accomplished with a specially designed optical color separation system that provides a signal similar to the NTSC color signal. No color control unit is required."
"Experiments are reported with a simple motion detector which uses a small number of sample-and-hold circuits. The detector can readily detect motion at a particular spatial location in a television picture. By the addition of spatial filtering in the form of rectangular windows of adjustable dimensions over which the picture signal is averaged before sampling, the frequency of spurious motion indications due to noise is reduced to an insignificant level while providing for some object-selectivity on the basis of spatial frequency content."
"A representative selection of television film commercials was evaluated for picture quality (not content) in a film preview room conforming to a proposed recommended practice. The same observers evaluated these films subsequently when they were displayed on television picture monitors using GE PE240 and RCA TK-27 4-vidicon telecines as the transducers. The correlation of the scores given each picture for the optical and the television presentation is given. This correlation should give confidence to users of the film preview room that their judgment will apply to television display."
"A survey for providing data on currently prevailing audio-visual projection conditions in classrooms is described. Only visual problems and the quality of the projected image were considered in this study. Classrooms were classified into several categories, providing a reasonable representation of the audio-visual environment in the geographical areas surveyed. Measurements of stray light levels and brightness ratios were made, using projection equipment belonging to the schools. It was found that the individual classroom is now regularly the center for audiovisual presentations and that improvements are needed. An effective solution in most cases would be the installation of more efficient window shielding to achieve the necessary low stray light levels. Further study, guidance and the dissemination of pertinent information to the educational community are urgently needed."
"A new television pickup device, the Bivicon® tube, has made possible a simple color telecine camera. This note describes a further simplification possible because of the tolerance most observers have to transient misregistration of image luminance and chrominance."
"In September 1968 the Joint Committee on Inter-Society Coordination (JCIC) set up an Ad Hoc Committee to examine the entire television system in order to determine the cause of significant and objectionable deviations in color as viewed on the home receiver. The JCIC represents the Electronic Industries Association, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, the National Association of Broadcasters, the National Cable Television Association and the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers."
"In 1969, Mr. Calmet, an engineer with the O.R.T.F., made known his proposal for a new 16 SEPMAG system for improving the quality and operational conditions of synchronous sound. From the beginning, the proposal stressed the importance of compatibility with the existing systems, and the prospect of thus being able to gradually establish a uniform standard aroused the interest of many broadcasting organisations."
           "Although there was not exactly a renaissance in the theatrical industry in 1972, overall volume did increase and many signs pointed to a significant upturn. Some 283 feature pictures were eligible for Academy Award consideration, while more than 320 were produced in the United States."
       "A New Concept of stereoscopic geometry and its suggested electronic, optical and mechanical implementation allows for projection from a single point within a conventional theater projection booth. The presently customary seating arrangement can be maintained. A special complexed projection screen is necessary, as well as a special high-speed projector, projecting a special lenticular film with spherical surface elements in a continuous mode."
           "By milling out a 16mm camera aperture plate so that most of the film area ordinarily reserved for the soundtrack becomes available for the picture, one can increase the frame aspect ratio to 1.66 and get what is called the super-16 format. Attempts to demonstrate the feasibility of super 16 date from Mosser's work in 1963 and Ericson's work in 1965. As recently as 1970, super 16 was regarded as experimental, but today it must be described as a complete and proven system. Among the cameras that have been successfully converted to super 16 are the Eclair NPR and ACL, the Bolex and Auricon Cine-Voice cameras, the Arriflex 16B1 and 16SR and the Aaton 7. Some of these come from the factory already converted and some are easily converted by the user. New lenses (especially a new Canon f/2 zoom lens), improved film stocks, suppliers who now sell and rent all kinds of super-16 equipment and laboratories that can provide high-quality processing, printing, and blowups of super-16 film — all of these also played a part in the evolution of an accepted super-16 format."
"The printed results of making 35mm blowup negatives from film shot in 16mm have improved dramatically over the past 25 years. This improvement can be attributed to numerous factors: improved lenses, cameras, 16mm film stocks and blowup negatives; new ways of eliminating the effects of scratches and abrasions on the original; use of new high-quality aspherical blowup lenses; more effective exposure-control techniques; and the super-16 format. Taking advantage of the first factors is still the responsibility of the filmmaker, but the others are effectively used in a new, fully automated, additive, blowup optical printer which is described. The advantage of the printer is that a complete feature dupe can be made in just a few days compared with the weeks to months necessary for nonautomated systems."
"Over the seven years from 1966 to 1972, thirteen films produced in 16mm by University of Southern California students have been blown up to 35mm by laboratory models of the optical printer, and now — assuming as near perfect an original as can be made — the 35mm print results show quality and detail which are not apparent in the best 16mm prints. Artistic and technical factors determining whether a film is suitable for blowup begin with composition: 16mm has a 1:1.33 format while most 35mm formats are 1:1.85, and if TV is a possibility then TV safe field areas must be observed. Inferior filters and lenses that are improperly mounted must be avoided. Clear Mylar tape must not be used for splicing because the liquid used in liquid gating is a solvent for the tape's adhesive. Notwithstanding necessary compromises between quality and speed, strict attention to detail does pay off."
"The question of how suitable 16mm film is for television productions is a controversial one, and there appear to be substantive arguments for both sides. Real savings in the cost of 16mm stock compared with the cost of 35mm stock might be cancelled by the costs of necessary new equipment. With new high-quality 16mm stock becoming available, 16mm might be the way of the future — but what about electronic reproduction and electronic editing which may take the place of much film? To throw some light on this, three views have been adapted and condensed from American Cinemeditor, Summer 1972. The second of these three views, that by Sidney P. Solow, was also published in the September 1972 American Cinematographer to whom the Journal is indebted for the illustrations."
"The author is very much in favor of shooting on 16mm film for television “because it works.” The difference in cost between 16mm and 35mm is substantial for many reasons. Production is much easier, the quality can be very good and there is nothing wrong with such economy."
"With the best available 16mm film stocks and extreme care in cinematography and production, it is possible to produce a reasonably good quality syndicated series for TV, but the quality is still not up to network standards. Sixteen millimeter film is perfectly satisfactory for newsfilm (where duping is not necessary) and for documentaries (where the degraded quality lends authenticity). Valid comparisons are hard to make between 16mm and 35mm costs because laboratory services for one medium may not be available for the other. A completely electronic (videotape) approach to program production is gaining adherents, but — with the recent development of a very fine grain, fast, color negative film — 16mm may yet compete with the network-quality routes to television programing. The eight possible routes to television programing (including the electronic approach and the Japanese and British approaches) are diagramed in the approximate order of descending quality; but, of course, a good deal depends on the proficiency and equipment available."
"The author — with extensive direct editing experience in both 16mm and 35mm — believes that neither medium provides the whole answer to TV program production. The 16mm medium is very well suited for documentaries, but shooting feature or TV films on location on 16mm becomes a matter of compromises, trade-offs and some frustration. Dealing with noise interference by laying in a wild line or loop line seems almost to require flexibility that is not there in 16mm. Synchronization problems and film tears abound when a 35mm soundtrack is used to run with a 16mm picture. Perhaps one of the biggest difficulties is for a professional 35mm editor to become a professional 16mm editor, but with pride and care and hard work the adjustment can be made. If the producer, director, production manager and editor cover all the pros and cons in advance, there will be fewer 16mm pictures that for specific quality requirements should have been shot in 35mm and there will be few shot in 35mm and less money wasted compared with 16mm when that meets the use and quality needed."
"Special features of a new 523-line scanned laser display system are described. These include: (1) the addition of beam wobbling to the polygonal mirror scanning system to allow improvement of the horizontal resolution by a factor of 3.6; (2) a relay lens between the horizontal and vertical deflectors, to minimize deflector aperture requirements; (3) an auxiliary deflection system to compensate for raster irregularity; and (4) an automatic optical black-level control system. The resulting horizontal and vertical resolutions are 500 and 370 TV lines, respectively, and raster uniformity is excellent. Horizontal jitter is less than 0.02 μs and vertical jitter is unnoticeable. The primary colors used and their sources are: 632.8 nm (He–Ne laser), 514.5 nm (argon ion laser) and 476.5 nm (argon ion laser). Low screen brightness is the biggest remaining problem."
"Audio-visual equipment is now manufactured for a variety of mains voltages, frequencies and connectors to interface with world-wide power systems. A standard low direct-current voltage is proposed for all components of audiovisual equipment and power outlets to be used in individual study and small group instruction. Several benefits are discussed: increased user safety, international compatibility, more portable equipment, more efficient optical systems, possibly lower cost equipment and use of equipment in places where there are no electrical mains."
 "The rapid growth of closed-circuit television and videotape recording has brought a new aid to teaching, business, laboratories and to many parts of our normal social and business life. This article, reprinted from British Kinematography Sound and Television for September 1972, is intended primarily to assist the user of closed-circuit television to obtain the maximum performance from the video recorder and videotape and to ensure that this method of operation is not causing inferior results and the unnecessary replacement of videotape; however, the information and suggestions are applicable, as well, to equipment used in broadcasting and cablecasting. — K. Blair Benson, Vice-President for Television Affairs"
"In the Spring of 1926, the Society of Motion Picture Engineers met in Washington, D.C., on the tenth anniversary of SMPE's founding. The members were received at the White House by President Calvin Coolidge and a photograph (no longer in existence) was taken of the group with President Coolidge (SMPE Transactions, 1928, p. 583)."
"The Joint Committee on Inter-Society Coordination (JCIC) has formed an Ad Hoc Committee for the Study of Television Sound (AHCSTS). An organizational meeting of the AHCSTS was held in Chicago, Ill., 11 April 1973, concurrent with the Technical Conference of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE)."
              "The basic philosophy of modern cinecamera design is discussed in detail and the many possibilities with which the camera designer is confronted are examined. The cameraman's — that is, the user's — desires and wishes are taken into consideration, and design trade-offs and compromise solutions are evaluated. After a brief market analysis, such topics as magazine types, film transport, reflex viewing, exposure control, zoom lenses, shutters, Super 16, motor drives, automatic controls, sound systems, noise, maintenance and human engineering are analyzed from the designer's point of view."
"A powerful flow-visualization technique in described which overcomes the disadvantages of primitive flow-visualization methods (lack of precision, clarity and/or convenience relative to the commonly used probe techniques). The new technique uses a tracer fluid which is continuously present in latent form in the test fluid (eliminating injection problems) and which undergoes a dramatic color change (a reversible photochromic reaction) in a pattern generated instantly by irradiation with a pattern of ultraviolet light. A typical setup employs this fluid in some transparent flow channel, with an ultraviolet light source (such as a frequency-doubled ruby laser), a suitable background light source and a high speed motion-picture camera. Many previously intractable fluid dynamics problems have yielded to this technique, and improved resolution and the use of computer logging should greatly increase its utility."
"Most applications of the photochromic technique of flow visualization have involved elaborate or expensive equipment. A simple, inexpensive application of the technique is described applied to a study of the fluiddynamics phenomena involved in mass transfer across a liquid gas interface. Essentially the set-up requires only a stirred beaker with photochromic dye solution, several relatively inexpensive sources of illumination (no laser) and a 35mm still camera or, alternatively, a movie camera. The analysis of the trace patterns photographed as described and the association between the flow pattern observed and the expected heat and mass transfer mechanisms is discussed."
"Color television receivers in the U.S.A. generally have a white color approximately equivalent to the appearance of a black-body at 9300 K, or higher. The white reference of a studio monitor is specified at D6500. In connection with the study of color television variability being conducted by an Ad Hoc Committee (AHCCTS) of JCIC, the question was asked, “Is a viewer's tolerance to color variation different for the two display situations?” To answer this question observers were asked to rate for quality pictures having a wide gamut of color variation originating from photographic slides, presented through telecine separately on two receivers adjusted to the two display conditions. Observers ranked the pictures displayed on the D6500 receiver consistently higher in quality than the pictures displayed on the 9300-K receiver. — The conclusion that viewers prefer pictures displayed at a white reference of D6500 to those referenced to 9300 K prevented obtaining an answer to the original question on tolerance to color variability, but in itself is a more important fact bearing on the choice of a white reference for television receivers."
"In most present-day helical-scan cassette videotape players, tape tension (and therefore tape stretch) is not controlled by a vacuum block as in quadruplex systems but by manual adjustment of the tape supply tension. If the tension is not correct, a timing error results which causes the picture to be skewed to the left or right. An effective automatic skew-correction circuit has been developed that feeds an output signal through an operational amplifier and a Darlington output stage to 2 rotary solenoid that controls tape tension. Skew error after correction is less than 0.5 μs. One type of widely used Japanese cassette player was modified with the skew corrector in less than 20 min using only screwdriver and soldering iron. When a videotape cassette player must operate unattended and when tapes come from many sources automatic skew correction is essential."
"Three independent characteristic factors affect TV transmission picture quality: linear distortions, nonlinear distortions and noise. A new improved instrument has been developed for the measurement and analysis of video noise in accordance with CCIR Recommendation 421.2. This video noise meter has both true rms and peak-to-peak calibration for objective measurement of random, periodic and impulse noise. Highpass, lowpass and weighting filters permit detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis of the noise, including hum. By interchanging filter modules and resetting an internal switch, one can use the same instrument for both NTSC and PAL Standards. A built-in sag and tilt compensating circuit eliminates pseudonoise components such as are generated by shading of video pickup tubes. The instrument has an accuracy and repeatability of better than 0.5 dB and has a dynamic range of 85 dB, permitting testing of both subassemblies and complete systems."
"High-quality stereophonic photographic soundtracks are now possible for 16mm and 35mm motion pictures. Each stereophonic channel is recorded in one-half the area of the normal variable-area soundtrack. The stereophonic sound is electronically processed by a commercial noise-reduction device prior to recording and printing, and restored in the projector upon reproduction. This technique provides signal-to-noise ratios in each channel which are equal to or better than those obtained on conventional photographic soundtracks. Projector modifications are simple and inexpensive. The processed stereophonic soundtrack can be compatible with unmodified monaural equipment."
"Note: Some aspects of the subject as presented here do not fit the usual content of Journal papers; however, the combination of engineering and practical matters has favored publication. — Sound mixing for nontheatrical and television films can be accomplished with a variety of equipment with adaptations and combinations now feasible. These possible arrangements and their effectiveness are described and evaluated."
"When Temple University's student body and campus facilities were being expanded a plan was made to use television as a communications bond between the separate campuses and schools. The plan was for a central program to utilize television for instruction and enrichment in the classroom. Today, through expansion and the utilization of the campus distribution system, the plan is successful."
"The Richardson Communications Center at Trinity University has been dedicated and is now in operation. It is expected to help students acquire near-professional skills in TV and film production. The color TV systems and 16mm motion-picture facilities (as well as a color TV mobile unit) will allow extensive and imaginative services to be offered to the campus as a whole and to the wider community beyond the university."
"In connection with a comprehensive study of causes of variability in the color of television pictures, being conducted by an ad hoc committee (AHCCTS) of a joint industry committee (JCIC), a subcommittee has been investigating the contribution of telecine equipment and practices to the problem. The investigation has included detailed examination by subcommittee members of particular telecine operations and the preparation of videotape transfers from a common motion-picture film print at several telecine installations. In addition, a questionnaire was sent to broadcasters to obtain information on equipment in use, operating procedures, and attitudes toward the telecine operation. — This paper reports the results of this work to date. The conclusion is drawn that the telecine operation is a significant source of television picture variation, independent of and adding directly to the variation usually attributed to the film input itself."
           "A sound-recording technique has been devised that uses light-emitting diodes and fiber-optics to expose the soundtracks; then optical fibers couple the soundtracks to phototransistors for playback. The soundtracks produced by this method are variable density. Test results and limitations are presented. The capability of recording a photographic film soundtrack in 1/100-in (0.254-mm) width and 16 parallel tracks in less than 5 mm (0.197 in) may have application to wide-screen motion picture soundtracks in the future."
"A color converter was developed with a view to improving color reproduction in television. Using this converter, an investigation was made into the relation of color TV to memory color; it was found that the memory color depended on the subject, not the viewer. The memory color related to the flesh color of white persons has a dominant wavelength of λd = 585 nm and an excitation purity of Pe = 32.7%."
"A critical relationship exists between the spectral reflectance of flesh colour and a television camera's Red-Green spectral analysis. The basic spectral reflectance of flesh is uniquely shaped by oxyhemaglobin and reduced hemaglobin. Cosmetics have a similar spectral shape but are shifted in wavelength, causing them to be more critical of camera errors than flesh colour alone without cosmetics. — Preliminary experiments have shown that a synthetic flesh colour line-up can achieve a high degree of picture matching. Vectorscope monitoring is recommended for quickly adjusting the reproduction of a lineup flesh colour as it is less prone to the disturbing effects of noise, and is quicker to use because it can be interpreted more directly than separate R, G and B waveforms. — The preffered reproduction of flesh colour on colour television needs establishing in RGB or encoded terms using a synthetic flesh colour sample that considers the use and effect of cosmetics."
"Some of the reasons for discrepancies between observed and measured luminances of theater screens have been investigated. The resultant spectral distribution is obtained by using a typical coated lamphouse reflector with a carbon-arc or xenon light source that is then combined with the spectral response of the eye and of photometric instruments. The data presented suggest that photometric instruments might be modified to have a mesopic sensitivity to more closely match the spectral response of a partially dark-adapted eye of an observer in a theater. An additional Helmholtz Kohlrausch effect also tends to make xenon screens appear brighter."
"The design considerations peculiar to underwater television systems are described and discussed. The LLLTV camera can provide a means of compensating for the losses in the underwater environment due to spectral filtering, attenuation and decreased scene contrast to provide a feasible system design. LLLTV will allow use of ambient light for biological, geological and environmental studies at increased observation ranges. It is concluded that highly sensitive TV cameras have definite application in underwater television systems."
                "An assessment of color positive developing is made by analyzing a Ib gamma strip read on an automatic recording densitometer. The output of the densitometer is fed to a minicomputer through an analog-to-digital converter. The interpretation of the computer output is typed out as full instructions on a teletypewriter giving a decision as to whether the process is normal or abnormal and, if abnormal, it lists probable cause and corrective action to be taken. A further use of the computer is correcting printer punched-tape programs, which is a valued aid in timing color prints."
"A new segmented lens has been designed and fabricated that is intended to replace a conventional, continuous-surface lens used in making color TV picture tubes. The lens is employed in the lighthouse during the phosphor dot screening process. Using the segmented lens, it has been possible to reduce beam landing errors by more than 50% in the new 110° deflection angle picture tubes. With this lens, the wide-angle tubes should be no more difficult to produce than ordinary 90° tubes, and when it is used in the manufacture of 90° tubes, pictures of unprecedented high quality are made possible."
"Lighting facilities in the seven TV Studios of Maison de Radio-Canada are described. These facilities are grouped with the video control equipment located in vision control rooms. Six of the studios are similar in design, layout and facilities provided. Power distribution to luminaires is via 162 outlets rated at 2-kW capacity and 81 at 5-kW. Four of the studios have their outlets and dimmers interconnected by slider (patch) power switching systems and the other two have dimmers rated at outlet capacity connected directly to the outlets. The seventh studio described has a production area of more than 5,000 ft.2 (460 m2) and has a permanent seating arrangement for 668 (412 on the lower balcony and 256 on the upper balcony)."
"Over the decade since the first prototype Snorkel camera system was developed, its potentialities have been expanded and redefined several times. Unusual versatility and freedom of movement are made possible by shooting vertically downward through an optical relay tube which has a small mirror positioned at an angle below the objective lens. Where initially only 16mm and 35mm cameras were used with this system, videotape and electronic cameras may now be used also. After concentrating in the early years on films of architectural models, the direction and emphasis of the system's developments have greatly changed through its use in TV commercial production and its work with actors. Directors and actors can almost completely ignore the mass of the camera when the Snorkel is used. Likely directions of future developments are considered."
"The MY-50 light-emitting diode used in the first 16-channel experimental recorder is a small, plastic-encapsulated crystal of gallium arsenide phosphide. It is a standard, mass-produced, low-cost unit made by the Monsanto Company of Cupertino, Calif."
"The variety, range and precision of methods available for photographic recording of fast phenomena have been increasing steadily. The capabilities of some of the newer techniques will be described. Reasonably detailed photographs may be taken of most macroscopic phenomena that are not too remote. The difficulties are greater when the interest is in fine spatial detail. These problems are accentuated in cinemicrography where the image moves many times faster than the event."
"This was the tenth in the series of international meetings that began in 1952 under the sponsorship of the SMPTE, this one being held during the period 25-30 September 1972 at Nice, France. More than 400 persons attended the Congress and its associated exhibition of technical equipment. The United States was represented by 40 persons, and participated in the exhibition with stands from Cordin, Photo Sonics, Shotec, and Instrumentation Marketing Corp."
"This is a survey of television recording from 1955 to 1970. The history begins with the kinescope recording era, both in monochrome and color, and continues with the introduction of the first commercial magnetic videotape recorder by Ampex in April 1956. It describes the first helical-scan videotape recorder introduced by Toshiba in Japan in Sept. 1959, and it details progress made to improve videotape quality culminating in the adoption of new “high-band” recording standards in 1964. The field of stop-, slow- and reverse-motion magnetic disc recorders is surveyed. The history describes progress made in thermoplastic and electron-beam recording in a vacuum; high-speed magnetic contact printing is discussed. The resurgence of color kinescope recording as a means of producing electronic motion pictures is narrated. The cassette/cartridge revolution is covered from the introduction of the CBS EVR system to the Teldec method of video playback from a phonograph disc."
"Average picture level (APL) of a film is the integrated optical density or transmission of a full picture frame. Its television correlate is the video signal level averaged over a full frame. This paper reports measurements of samples of television newsfilm, spot commercials and program films. A wide range of APL is reported in all types of films. In terms of optical density, APL of television entertainment films varied from 0.4 to 1.9, with a mean of 0.9 for ten different programs. (The SMPTE Color Reference Test Film has a mean APL of 1.3.) Newsfilm had less variation in APL, ranging from 0.6 to 1.9, with a mean density of 1.1. Film commercials ranged widely in APL, from 0.3 to 2.0. The mean density of 1971 commercials, 0.7, is lower than that of programs or news, and is noticeably lower than it was in 1969. Thus, commercials are noted as having higher APL than programs or newsfilms, and that difference has increased in the past two years."
  "Integrated circuit techniques and a systems approach are making it possible to centralize equipment and facilities at Maison de Radio-Canada and to permit them to be assigned as needed. Such centralizing is desirable to meet the timing requirements of color TV, but it requires remote control of switching, delegation, machine control, etc. Particular attention is given to a Program Routing Switcher (which routes program audio and video from source to distribution) and a Control Assignment Switcher (which handles the point-to-point assignment of intercom, pulses, and remote machine control). A minicomputer is employed to control the Program Routing Switcher and perform code translations and validity checks; provision has been made to computerize the Control Assignment Switch also. Other systems and subsystems treated include studio vision mixers, TV audio consoles, the TV intercom system, live camera channels, and VTR and telecine chains."

         "The RCA HoloTape system is designed to prerecord monochrome and color TV programs on a special tape for later playback over conventional TV receivers and monitors. For color TV programs, the luminance and chrominance signals are converted to a pair of images that are recorded on photoresist-coated plastic tape in the form of “Fraunhofer” holograms. Ways of increasing hologram redundancy and thus decreasing image noise are examined. The process of replicating Holo-Tapes involves recording holograms in a photoresist layer, electroforming a nickel master and thermomechanically embossing the holographic information onto a thermoplastic film. High-quality stereo sound is recorded in a groove near the tape edge using phonograph-record technology. The HoloTape system is naturally compatible with the NTSC, PAL and SECAM color systems. The player consists of only the tape and simple transport, a low-power helium-neon laser, a sound pickup and a TV camera."
"This paper presents theoretical and experimental aspects associated with the use of neutrally buoyant tracer particles for defining fluid motion with cine photography. A dimensionless-parameter argument, based on particle size, leads to a criterion for determining when particle and fluid velocities are equivalent. The authors assert that results which do not vary with particle size do not contain deviations due to the presence of particles, assuming a particle size ratio greater than 2. Two applications are presented along with two carrier fluid-particle systems. Details of the photographic technique are included, indicating a procedure for determination of velocity components from two mutually perpendicular views of the tracer particles."
"While the methods for measuring and controlling cross-modulation distortion have been practiced for many years, the costs of these tests preclude their use as frequently as one would desire for best quality control. This paper describes a new test instrument that permits the laboratory to exercise control for each individual printer and for each print. The instrument requires only an inch (2 ½ cm) of film rather than the several hundred feet (hundred or more meters) of film normally required for such a test. A special and unique feature of the instrument is the phase comparison test which indicates to the operator the direction and magnitude by which the print density should be changed for minimum distortion (i.e. the amount of increase or decrease in density required). In addition, the instrument provides a direct measure of the level of distortion that is present, and also an indication of printer performance (e.g. slippage contact, etc.). Since the test is obtained by simply inserting the test section into the instrument aperture, only a few seconds are required to make the analysis. All of the presently used cross-modulation tone-pairs are accepted by the instrument."
"This article surveys the history of systematic assessment of the operating conditions in photographic sound recording before 1945 and suggests that the work should be resumed in order to relate the old results to more recent insights. Since there is no unique English term to describe the audible effect of image spread in a photographic sound track the descriptive German term “thunder-effect” has been retained."
"The silicon array pickup tube (silicon vidicon) has been found to have an excellent response to red light superior to that of the lead-oxide tube. The silicon vidicon has been teamed with the lead-oxide tube in a “hybrid” camera with a silicon vidicon in the red channel and lead-oxide tubes in the blue and green channels. The result has been greatly improved color reproduction and camera sensitivity. The development of the silicon vidicon is reviewed and certain advantages including long life and better resolution are discussed."
"An audio system has been designed that is strongly resistant to the effects of noise and hum from nearby video monitors, power transformers, SCR light dimmers, etc. The new audio system is based ultimately on just three different components: the Raytheon CK-1115 Light Dependent Resistor or LDR, the Beyer type BV35570 miniature audio transformer and the RCA type CA3036 integrated circuit. When these components are assembled in a few basic combinations on Vector type 812WE pegboard cards (used for the security of gold-to-gold contact and the simplicity of replacement), high-quality building block modules, such as the 20-dB audio amplifier, are obtained. From such modules are constructed a microphone preamplifier, a fader card, a bridge card, a mixer card and a booster card along with a line amplifier and a monitor driver card. The immunity of the system to hum and noise is shown by the fact that the system shows a 63-dB SNR with a — 60-dBm input level to a microphone preamplifier when 26 nearby video monitors and three racks with power transformers are operating — and the SNR improves by only 0.25 dB with all this equipment turned off. Reliability also has been nearly perfect."
    "It is to be feared that some fields may not have received the attention which they merit because of the impossibility of securing from those interested in different lines all of the information which would have proved helpful. — From the Report of the SMPE committee on Progress, Chairman A. R. Denningtn, Transactions No. 10, May 1920 (pp. 33–37)."
         "On July 27 and 28, the Society presented a symposium on Underwater Photographic Applications at the Hotel Del Coronado in Coronado, Calif. This symposium represented the Society's latest and most ambitious effort to keep the membership abreast of advances in underwater photographic techniques."
"About fifteen years ago the navigation of the air was something looked upon with eyes of doubt all over the world. The first flights of the Wrights were hailed with amazement and the newspapers and magazines were filled with accounts of their achievements. At that time it was regarded as a marvelous thing to reach an altitude of a hundred feet and to maintain a biplane in the air for more than a few minutes."
"The flat-port camera housings sometimes used by scuba-diving cinematographers are subject to coma, astigmatism, pincushion distortion and chromatic aberration as well as a magnification effect that makes objects appear 33% larger than they really are. To correct these effects, concentric or “dome” ports of Plexiglas are now available in housings for the 16mm and 35mm Arriflexes, the 16mm Beaulieu and the 16mm Kodak K-100. Shooting through water reduces the apparent object distance by 25% (or even more with a dome-port), so plus-diopter lenses or extension shims are used as in close-up photography. Other correctors include a reversed Galilean telescope called the Ivanoff corrector, the Cousteau dome with its negative meniscus and — the best choice — the water-contact lens that is intended to be used only in water. Optical viewfinders are now replacing the wire-type finders. Tungsten floodlights should be used for side-lighting or top-lighting, but if batteries are used they should have catalytic protection against hydrogen explosions. The author prefers Ektachrome MS film 7256 and Ektachrome EF film 7241 for normal and low-light conditions, respectively."
"The present performance capability of underwater low-light-level television (LLLTV) cameras used in biological and geological survey applications is discussed. Video-processing techniques are shown to be useful to improve contrast loss due to backscatter, to provide vertical aperture correction and to reduce systematic shading patterns. Performance of present underwater television systems can be improved by using such techniques."
"We propose a criterion to compare photographic films and television tubes on a common basis. It is based on calculating the product of the signal-to-noise ratio times the spatial bandwidth, e.g., SNR·Ψ. We show how to make the pertinent calculations without measurements of any sort, directly from manufacturer's data. Results are given for film and television tube. They are summarized on the accompanying figure which shows relative performance between film and television, and with respect to the ideal quantum detector."
"A black-and-white film has been made relating to the characteristics of water and practical experiments have been made to determine ability to penetrate water compared with other films."
"An expression for a family of curves can offer valuable assistance to the designer when hydrodynamic stability, buoyancy, contents shape and operational depth impose stringent design specifications on underwater enclosures. As a basis for seeking a useable expression it is noted that the common spherical or cylindrical shapes for pressure vessels utilize a circular cross section easily defined in mathematical terms. Investigating the equation of a circle reveals that it can be modified to produce shape variations with extreme flexibility for enclosing a particular mechanism or component. These circle-variation equations, dubbed super-circles by Danish philosopher Piet Hein, have been utilized extensively by architects to shape buildings and landscapes."
"A new diver-operated underwater 16mm motion-picture camera has been developed with particular emphasis on human engineering and ease of operation. Designated the DBM 9–1, it is based on the DBM-9 developed in the early 1960s. The new camera has an improved hydrodynamic shape, is neutral buoyant and can be adjusted to plus or minus 1–lb (0.45-kg) buoyancy. The camera uses the Leitz 6.6mm lens system which corrects for underwater distortion."
"A Self-Contained Underwater Television Recording System (SUTRS) has been developed to permit underwater television recording and playing back of videotapes, without the difficulties resulting from operation with cables for power and signal transmission. Following several prototypes, more advanced systems have been built with such features as full-field recording, a 4-in (10.2-cm) CRT viewfinder which can be used to check videotapes under water, a full enunciator panel and automatic lens cap to prevent vidicon tube burning. Systems with silicon diode tubes for low-light-level operation are also available. The batteries used are rechargeable more than 450 times and they last up to 12 h on a full charge. The U.S. Navy now has two operational units and is awaiting two more for low-light applications."
"The spectral properties of some marine phytoplankters have been obtained in the visible (400–700 nm) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. From those data the colors of the phytoplankters (dinoflagellates and diatoms) were calculated using standard C.I.E. techniques. The color-matching functions used x̄, ȳ, z̄ were the 10 ° field-of-view functions of 1964. Use of these functions better approximates the color as seen by a normal observer than those of the 2 ° field-of-view functions. The spectral transmittance of each of the samples were derived from their absorption spectra. These spectra were observed on a Beckman DK-1-A spectrophotometer, using the method of Emerson and Lewis as modified by Yentsch.7 The colors were found to lie within the same area as those of plants measured by Gates, Kagan, et al.3"
"Carl Louis Gregory, motion-picture engineer, cinematographer, director, author, lecturer, and pioneer member of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers, was born in Walnut, Kansas, in 1882. He died 11 March 1951 at his home in Van Nuys, Calif."
"System Modulation Transfer (SMT) acutance has been calculated for photographic materials and reported with Modulation Transfer (MT) test results since its introduction in 1962. The reliability of this acutance index has recently been questioned. Two defects were found, neither of which was a serious problem when the SMT model was introduced. These defects become important in the presence of chemical adjacency effects. A proposed new model for acutance indices that avoids the defects in the SMT model has been evaluated. This Cascaded Modulation Transfer (CMT) acutance index correlates with visual experiments."
"The hazards of electrically initiated pyrotechnics as special effects in motion-picture production include static electricity, induced currents, leakage currents, accidental shorts, RF induction, lightning, accidental firing and ultra-sensitive devices. A safety program is set forth with equipment described and illustrated."
"In comments filed by the SMPTE with the Federal Communications Commission on 7 March 1972 relative to Docket 19314 covering code identification marks in the transmitted image area of broadcast stations, the Society suggested that a complete study of identification and control functions be undertaken by a committee with industry-wide representation. In additional comments filed with the FCC on 8 May by the SMPTE, it was pointed out that the proceedings relative to Docket 19314 highlighted the problems of allocating portions of the video or audio television signals for various special functions, in addition to picture and sound transmission which may be of value to the public and to industry. Continuing, the Society noted that further study had resulted in the increased realization that prompt action was imperative, if these interests were to be best served in a manner least wasteful of available spectrum."
"This report is being submitted at this time to the Federal Communications Commission with a twofold purpose: (1) as a progress report on the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on Television Broadcast Ancillary Signals, a relatively new industry committee that has been charged by the Joint Committee for Intersociety Coordination (JCIC)1 with a study of the overall question of “ancillary” television broadcast signals, i.e., signals intended to be “piggybacked” on the program signal, to be used for a variety of special purposes; and (2) to provide the Commission with new information and recommendations developed in the course of the Committee's studies which may be of some help to the Commission in its resolution of currently pending rule making matters which involve many of the special signals which are included within the Committee's study. Section A deals with the progress report; Section B covers the recommendations of the Committee, based on its studies to date, on matters relating to ancillary signals which are pending at the Commission, but which as yet are unresolved."
      "On the opening day of the Society's 114th Technical Conference, 15 October, in New York, Walter A. Fallon, President and Chief Executive Officer of Eastman Kodak Company, gave this address enhanced with a four-screen audiovisual presentation. SMPTE President Byron Roudabush while introducing Mr. Fallon also described a special feature of the presentation, a sound-film clip from George Eastman's address to the Society of Motion Picture Engineers in 1930. Mr. Fallon"
      "In 1969, IEEE Standard 145 was published as a list of basic terms of antenna theory and practice. That document treated antenna gain as a fundamental property, with impedance and polarization as independent properties. The definitions of gain, directivity, impedance, and polarization were worded to emphasize this independence. Various other significant groups of terms were also defined, such as the regions of the electromagnetic field of an antenna, the terms relating to cross section, the tracking antenna techniques, and the idealized radiators."
 "This standard prescribes methods for performing tests specified in American National Standard General Requirements for Distribution, Power, and Regulating Transformers, C57.12.00-1973 (IEEE Std 462-1973) and in the separate transformer standards of the C57.12 Series of American National Standards."
"In this period of transition, authors and editors of scientific and engineering literature sometimes need basic information on the International System of Units (the Metric System), described in this standard. This contains the units, supplementary units, and multiplier prefixes of the International System, along with instructions for their correct use. Numerous examples are given. Conversions between the International and the British-American System are also discussed, and a procedure is described for rounding after such conversions. Three appendixes define the International System base units, list conversion factors, and explain the work of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures."
"The continuing expansion and modernization program in the cement industry has placed an increasing importance on the cement plant power distribution system. Increasing plant capacity accompanied by larger kilns, grinding mills, crushers, and the increasing use of automatic controls has placed greater stress on the adequacy and reliability of the distribution system. Safety,capacity, reliability, and low maintenance - all at a reasonable cost - are the requirements ofthe cement plant power distribution system."
"The physical means by which electric energy is received from the electric utility is known as an electric interconnection. The primary elements include transmission or distribution circuits, transformers, and switching devices in the form of circuit breakers, fuses, and isolating disconnecting switches. The secondary elements include sensing devices to obtain information to operate the primary equipment intelligently, and relays to initiate removal of equipment from service automatically and quickly when an electric fault or disturbance occurs. It is important to remember that the physical laws of nature which govern the operating behavior of an electric system do not recognize defined lines of electric facility ownership. Thus for a well-engineered interconnection it is mandatory that problems in electric-system protection be studied and analyzed critically without regard to ownership. From the viewpoint of service reliability and service continuity, it is basic to understand that the best conceived, best implemented relaying system is no substitute for an adequately designed power system; and, indeed, inadequately applied protective relaying will contribute to inadequate and unsatisfactory performance of an otherwise well-designed electric system. In considering a new installation, or changes to an existing arrangement, it is very important that protective relaying and safety be given careful attention in the early stages of planning."
"This document applies to all Class 1E control switchboards (for example, main control room assemblies, auxiliary panels, local panels or racks, etc) as defined in Section 3, regardless of their application or location. It does not apply to the non-Class 1E control switchboards, except as they affect the Class 1E control switchboards, but recognizes that Class 1E control switchboards may be adjacent to, or joined with, other non-Class 1E control switchboards. This document includes, but is not necessarily limited to, design, construction, wiring practices, shipping, handling, storage, installation, testing, and quality assurance. General design practices which are not unique to Class 1E control switchboards are not addressed in this document. This document applies to piping systems and Class 1E equipment only as they may affect the integrity of the Class lE control switchboard."
"This document is based on IEC Publication 270-1968, Partial Discharge Measurements. adheres closely to the IEC recommendations with the following exceptions:(1) The terms partial discharge energy and partial discharge power are not used in this document but are defined for future reference.(2) Likewise, the corona discharge reference source shown in Fig 5 of the IEC document has been omitted since it is not in common use in the United States.(3) An Appendix concerning calibration techniques has been added since it is felt that the IECrecommendation is lacking in this respect."
"This performance standard covers absorptive and reflective attenuators, both fixed as well as continuously variable or variable in fixed steps, both manual and programmable types. It does not cover electronic or solid state-type attenuators. This standard permits the user to select for a specification those minimum performance parameters which characterize an attenuator. A list of preferred test methods is included permitting verification of the attenuation characteristics. Practical minimum performance limits are furnished for various applications. These are for guidance only and will improve with time."
"This standard establishes the graphic symbols for use in the preparation of logic diagrams representing logic functions implemented with two-state devices. The primary purpose of this standard is to enable a user to readily read and understand the function of the logic without requiring a specific knowledge of the constructional details of the device represented. This standard sets forth principles governing the formation of graphic symbols for logic diagrams in which the connections between symbols are generally shown with lines. Descriptions of logic functions, the graphic representation of these functions, and examples of their applications are given."
"This application guide for capacitance current switching applies to ac high-voltage circuit breakers rated in accordance with American National Standard Requirements for Capacitance Current Switching for AC HighVoltage Circuit Breakers, C37.073-1972. It is intended to supplement the American National Standard Application Guide for AC High-Voltage Circuit Breakers, C37.010-1972 (IEEE Std 320-1972), and specifically, to enlarge on Section 4.14.3, Capacitor Switching, and Section 4.14.4, Line Charging Switching. Circuit breakers rated and manufactured to meet other standards should be applied in accordance with application procedures adapted to their specific ratings."
"Conference proceedings front matter may contain various advertisements, welcome messages, committee or program information, and other miscellaneous conference information. This may in some cases also include the cover art, table of contents, copyright statements, title-page or half title-pages, blank pages, venue maps or other general information relating to the conference that was part of the original conference proceedings."
"The following topics are dealt with: insulation materials for severe environments; non-solvent ecology insulation coatings; coating, encapsulating and laminating resins; applications for consumer health and safety; applications for employee health and safety; thermal analysis and aging phenomena; trends in large rotating machinery; hermetic motor insulation system; insulation for form-wound motors; elastomeric insulation; outdoor insulation; liquid insulation; underground transmission and distribution; NEMA magnet wire session; electrical workshops; first level circuity; second level circuitry; third level circuitry; microwave materials; cost-effective microwave systems; insulation for electronics; materials system for electronics; thin polymer films; adhesives for electronics; and measurements for electronics."
"With the evidence of the past two years, industry has proved it can meet the challenge to produce the necessary standards to eliminate licensing and construction delays for nuclear plants. It has already proved that nuclear plants can be built and operated safely. The proof has unfortunately been on a small scale, with only a few of the utilities participating. In order to meet the time schedule to produce the many standards that are still required, the rest of the utilities must commit the necessary manpower to do the work and the various standards organizations must be expanded to properly administer and coordinate the effort. A big step has recently been taken by ANSI in setting up the sixteen area managers under the Nuclear Technical Advisory Board (NTAB)."
"The increasing number of nuclear power plants under construction or being planned poses a serious materials specification problem for the architect and engineer. In addition to the electrical properties of materials, the engineer must now consider the effects of radiation upon the physical integrity and flammability characteristics of a material. Moreover, there are no universally accepted test procedures or specifications which define the suitability of a material for use in nuclear power plants. While this paper does not attempt to impose a set of test procedures or specifications for nuclear power plant applications, it does attempt to shed some meaningful light on test procedures and call attention to some aspects of specifications which may have been previously overlooked. This report summarizes changes induced in a number of plastics and elastomers by gamma radiation up to a total dose of 200 megarads. The properties which were monitored are elongation, tensile break strength, hardness, and flammability characteristics."
"Electric machines intermittently used in an atmosphere of high humidity have relatively many faults. When we investigated these machines with coils using polyester enameled wire the following was proved: 1. Few faults occur in the machines when operated continuously. Most faults occur when the machines are started either on Monday, the day after a holiday, or on a humid or rainy day. 2. Many faults occur in the machines where a voltage is normally applied at the coil, even when the machines are not used. 3. The break-down points concentrated at the coils, located on the humid side of the machines, and to which a high voltage is applied. Then, the break-down is often accompanied with decrease of insulation resistance or the gathering of green copper salts on the enameled wire."
"Operational reliability of electrical cable-long of prime importance in electric utility generating stations-has become a fundamental need with the coming of age of nuclear fueled installations and their attendant potentially severe environment. New dimensions for retarding flame propagation and maintaining circuit integrity for extended periods of time during a fire are being specified, and in fact, reflect legitimate need. Trends towards more severe testing are supported by the Atomic Energy Commission and by the Nuclear Energy Property Insurance Association."
"The magnet wires conventionally used for hermetic motors are urethane polyvinyl formal (UF) wire, polyester-imide (EI) wire, and dual coated wires such as polyamide-imide overcoated polyester (AI/PE) wire and polyamide-imide overcoated polyester-imide (AI/EI) wire."
"Epoxy powder coatings have been developed which will produce continuous 0.5 mil pin-hole free films using electrostatic spray or electrostatic fluidized bed applications. The ability to produce these ultra thin coatings permits consideration of powder coatings for applications which were prohibited by the thicker coatings previously available. The chemical resistance, electrical and mechanical integrity, and the appearance of these ultra thin film coatings are equal or superior to that of the previously developed thicker coatings."
"The versatility of powdered resins is demonstrated by the broad range of applications on which there has been commercial success. These fall into several distinct groups. The three most obvious are: (1) electrical insulation, (2) decorative coating and (3) corrosion protection. Metal based printed circuit boards, stators, armatures, transformer cans-covers, bus bar, lawn furniture, metal toys, motor housings, large diameter pipe and small diameter pipe are a few of the ongoing applications where powdered resin is used."
"A Water Soluble Wire Enamel has been developed and successfully coated on copper and aluminum magnet wire. The story of the development of the polymer, its brainstorming, planning and evaluations are related. The film properties of this water-soluble polyester are approximately equal to solvent polyesters. Cresylic acid is no longer needed. Costs are approximately equal to solvent enamels. Because wire coaters were concerned about the emissions from their operations, this program was initiated to formulate wire enamels that would have acceptable effluent levels. This development was a joint venture of the Sherwin-Williams Company and Packard Electric, General Motors Division."
"Within the past ten years, electrodeposition coating for general protective purposes has been extended into a wide range of industries because of its high efficiency and the potential advantage of using water based materials. In this paper, the basic principles of the MEDIS process will be first reviewed and then technical details will be discussed."
"The new magnet wire manufacturing process based on electrodeposition named \"MEDIS\" was developed by us and this unique process has the following merits: (1) The finished wires have excellent electrical properties due to better eccentricity and fewer pin-holes. (2) Air pollution can be minimized by the use of the water dispersion. (3) Heat cost is reduced because of one coating and one baking system. (4) Film thickness can be easily controlled by varying the applied voltage without a wiper-die. A 32-wire-line plant has been commercially operated for production of \"MEDIS\" wives that has been used successfully in electrical equipment and appliances for more than two years. New \"MEDIS\" wires having class F~H thermal life are now under development. In the near future, we expect that the \"MEDIS\" process will be applied to rectangular wires and aluminum conductors."
"The aim of the formulator in the past was to improve the market value of his product. This was done by upgrading properties such as heat resistance, bond strength, stability and processing time, or by decreasing the selling price while maintaining the present properties."
"Today's trend in electrical equipment design is toward higher ratings and high capability with minimal increase in physical size or volume of the equipment. Inherent in this trend is an increase in operating temperatures. Temperatures can be reduced by using cooling passageways through which liquid or compressed gas is passed. An alternative is the use of thin walled void free insulation of high thermal capability. In the case of small and medium sized motors used in applications of widely varying loads, such as traction motors, the second alternative offers greater economy."
"Formulation of proprietary epoxy compositions has become a common practice for many manufacturers of cast epoxy parts. Two common techniques applied are the batch approach and the two component of `A' and `B' approach. In the former all the components are blended together and immediately transferred into the molds. In the latter technique the complete formulation is divided into two parts: the `A' side usually composed of the epoxy resin and a portion of the filler, and the `B' side composed of the rest of the filler, the hardener, and the catalyst. The advantage of this latter approach is that the `A' and `B' divisions usually have a long if not indefinite pot life. Thus large batches of `A' and `B' can be mixed individually and at the desired moment stoichiometric portions of the `A' and `B' master batches drawn off, blended together, and transferred into the molds."
"The cost of electrical equipments can be lowered by reducing the size and weight of the equipment. This has led to the need for the development of inexpensive heat resistant polymers having high mechanical strength at elevated temperatures."
"One of the newest, most rapidly advancing developments in the coatings field is the ultraviolet (UV) light cure of selected coating materials. This technique offers the potential for rapid and essentially non-polluting curing of the coatings.1 Studies of UV initiated vinyl polymerizations can be traced back nearly fifty years; however, curing of commercial coatings by UV was developed only in the late 1960's. Commercial UV cure applications in the United States have grown from two systems in 1971 to over thirty in 1972.2 By the end of 1974, more than ninety systems are expected to be in operation.3 Present commercial systems are primarily used in the furniture industry to cure fillers and topcoats on particle boards. Some plastic and metal substrates are also coated. Potential uses include cures of protective and decorate coatings on metal, plastics, wires, laminates, etc. The new technique has been recently reviewed.4'5 Unsaturated polyesters, usually diluted with styrene, are the most widely used resins for UV cured coatings. Since large quantities of polyesters are used in the electrical industry, we have examined and compared the electrical properties of UV cured polyesters with those obtained from conventional thermally cured systems in order to establish the feasibility for use of the UV technique in the production of electrical insulations."
"In 1969 the consumer electronics industry received some adverse publicity as the result of the National Commission on Product Safety's report on the potential for fires in color television receivers. The criticism was not without some justification for the color television receivers produced in 1965 and 1966 utilized basically the same insulation materials and test techniques that had seemed adequate in monochrome receivers. These materials were not adequate for the more severe environments present in these early color receivers and there was a sharp increase in the number of fire incidents attributable to television."
"Flammability resistance in all types of products is a desirable characteristic so long as it permits the product to fulfill its expected function. Wire and cable manufacturers have felt a special responsibility since their products are subject to temperature rises from the current they carry, they are often located in paths winding through a structure or apparatus and are often the nerve system for controls and safety circuits which must be kept operating."
"The existing code-standard making process is a capably one. The NEC provides direction for the entire electrical fraternity. The applicable safety standards covering electrical apparatus and equipment have been capable of up-date within a reasonable period."
"The introduction of double insulation into the North American market in the 1960's and its steady growth since then has been due to the following: 1. The increasing use of power tools in locations where proper grounding was not available. It has been estimated that only 15 percent of the homes in the USA have grounding type receptacles throughout.1 2. Requests from the U.S. Navy and several other large users of tools for double insulation. 3. Reports from Europe and Australia that electric shock accidents' have been reduced by the use of double insulated tools. 4. Recognition in the 1962 National Electrical Code of double insulation as an alternate to grounding of portable electric tools in residences. Expansion of that recognition in the 1968 Code2 to include industrial locations. 5. The publication of standards for double insulation by Underwriters' Laboratories.3 6. The increasing availability of materials which were suitable for protective and reinforced insulation."
"The emphasis which has been placed on the personal safety of both consumer and employee alike has generated a demand for the development of designs of portable electric tools which provide greater safety for the user. The possibility of injury due to electrical shock either through misuse of a tool or actual tool failure is a very real danger."
"Many electrical insulation and coating companies are studying anti-pollution devices to dispose of organic fumes or vapors in order to meet proposed environmental standards. These fumes may be the direct result of wire enameling, varnish impregnation, encapsulation, protective and/or decorative coating and adhesive processes. High efficiency of anti-pollution devices allows minimum operational expense to the manufacturer. These needs have challenged the chemist to adapt analytical techniques which will effectively monitor this equipment. These methods may also be used to analyze in-plant environmental conditions."
"Asbestos papers and boards have been widely used in thermal and electrical applications ever since their inception. The introduction of asbestos papers and boards designed to function primarily as electrical insulation was achieved in 1948 through the use of more sophisticated fiber processing techniques and unique binder systems. The improved types available today have found broad use. They contain asbestos fiber in varying amounts up to a maximum of approximately 90%."
"Some motors used in severe shipboard environments (moisture) are protected by encapsulating the stators. When failure occurs, the usual method of removing the windings from the stator is by burning out the insulation in an oven prior to repair and rewinding. This paper deals with the problem of thermal decomposition of encapsulants sufficiently to permit easy removal of the damaged windings without causing run-away fires and explosions during the burn-out operation. This study was made to establish burn-out procedures with more clearly defined safety against fire or explosion. Present Navy instructions require that these ovens operate at a temperature of 350°C and have an exhaust system designed to provide two air changes per minute."
"A large part of the present international standards regarding insulation classification, for particular equipment is based on the temperature classification of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in publication 85. This document, reflecting the occurrence of the plastics revolution, represented a transition from the traditional philosophy, \"Tell me what insulation material you have and I shall tell you its temperature class,\" towards a novel one which emphasized experimental verification as the basis for insulation rating. However, IEC 85 is now widely considered to be obsolete and its withdrawal, rather than a mere revision, has been officially proposed for the following reasons: Experimental verification is recommended in principle but no concrete directions were given. It is used indiscriminately for rating both insulating materials, insulation systems and insulated apparatus. An appendix with examples intended for guidance of designers is commonly being wrongly applied as a materials classification system in the traditional style."
"Many applications in the electrical industry require the use of materials that must sustain a mechanical load as well as provide electrical insulation. Applications such as these are electromechanical in nature, and include the armature bar support system in the stator, and the slot liner, blocking and retaining ring insulation in the rotor. In order to fill both the electrical and mechanical requirements of these applications, compromises have traditionally been necessitated in one of the material properties. The development of new materials has reduced the need for these compromises, as it has provided materials with increased mechanical strength without sacrificing insulating properties."
"The present paper covers a test procedure for the evaluation of thermal endurance of enamelled wires at constant voltage. In the NEMA Magnet Wire Technical Committee Presentation of 19711 it was proposed in clause 7 of “Additional work recommended” of the “Joint Sections Committee Report” to develop meaningful test methods for voltage endurance of magnet wire at elevated temperature. In the EIC 1971, the author presented a paper on statistical analysis applied to data obtained by IEEE 57.2 In the conclusion of this paper, recommendations for test development for magnet wire evaluation incorporating voltage and temperature were given. This paper proposes such a test method."
"This paper outlines a method for testing the thermal stability of magnet wire by measuring the viscoelastic behavior of tubed films obtained from magnet wire manufactured by standard equipment. Magnet wire is a composite of conductor and insulation material. The properties of magnet wire have been evaluated by standard tests, but the properties of only the magnet wire film are almost unknown at present."
"During the past ten to fifteen years all manufacturers of rotating machines have been obliged to give consideration to changing from the traditional thermoplastic insulation systems to those based on thermosetting resins. The established systems have used shellac and/or bitumen with mica splittings as the main dielectric barrier, and more recently glass cloth as the supporting medium. The change contemplated has been to a thermosetting insulation system incorporating synthetic resins, with mica paper replacing the mical splittings and glass cloth remaining as the supporting fabric."
"In the field of all types of large rotating machinery, design groups are keenly interested in having accurate and absolute values for the thermal conductivity of large coils as they exist in laminated iron slots. Thermal losses and temperature gradients are important design criteria for these machines. In many types of machines, the stator windings are not direct cooled with water or hydrogen gas circulating either through or in close proximity to the copper conductors. Therefore, the heat generated in the copper conductors must flow through the electrical insulation making this rate of flow very critical in the design and performance of the machine."
"Better insulation performance is persistently required for high voltage rotating machines with the trend of increasing capacity and rated voltage. Resistance to thermal shock, mechanical reliability and dielectric strength of insulation are especially important. As for the impregnating varnish, asphaltic compound has been replaced by synthetic resins with progress in the chemical industry. Unsaturated polyester and epoxy resins are the most popular resins, the latter becoming more important because of their overall suitability. On the other hand, the main barrier insulating material tends to move toward reconstituted mica from mica splittings. In this paper, electrical and thermomechanical performances of newly developed epoxy insulation systems based on mica splittings and reconstituted mica are compared with asphaltic compound and unsaturated polyester insulation systems based on mica splittings by extensive thermal cycle tests. Superior characteristics of epoxy insulation systems are proved."
"Superconductor technology has advanced rapidly in recent years and superconductors may now be applied to the DC windings of rotating electrical machinery. These machines operate with high air gap flux densities and this requires the use of an air gap stator winding, in which stator teeth are not used. The mechanical and electrical requirements of an air gap winding are described. A 5 MVA, 3 ph, 60 Hz, 4160 volt, 3600 RPM S.C. Generator utilizing an air gap winding which has been built and tested is described. The test results are presented for the S.C. Generator with the rotor winding operating at 4°K. Future developments are discussed for the application of S.C. Generators and S.C. Motors to power generation and ship propulsion."
"Economic considerations not withstanding, aluminum magnet wire for hermetic motors offers other advantages. For example, there is evidence of better resistance to long-term aging when organic insulations are applied to aluminum wire. It is common experience that aluminum wire winds easier once proper tensions are adjusted. Springback characteristics which are inherently less in aluminum wire allow for better coil conformation and more efficient use of available space. These advantages partially offset the lower conductivity values of aluminum wire. Historically, however, the primary drawback in using aluminum magnet wire has been in the development of a process to insure that reliable connections could be made."
"Hermetic motors used in refrigerators, room air-conditioners etc. which are operated with Refrigerant 12 or Refrigerant 22 and refrigeration oil, are required to have insulating materials whose characteristics are stable in these atmospheres. Generally, in Japan, refrigerant resistance of insulating materials is evaluated according to the tests prescribed in the Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS C3003-1969), Ref. (1), which include extraction, blister characteristics, etc. However, it has been difficult to establish correlations between these results and the performance of actual machines."
"Our department frequently receives, through our customers, motors which have failed prematurely in the field. Invariably, we are asked to determine the reason for the early failure. Often a visual inspection of the motor will yield the answers. If this fails, the condition of the motor insulation, especially the polyester film, is often the next area of investigation. The conditions under which the motor was run can frequently be estimated from the physical properties of the aged polyester film. However, physical property measurements are often impractical because of the required sample size and shape. Thus, an attempt was made to correlate chemical properties, which we could measure from as little as 0.5 grams of powdered film, with physical properties in order to ultimately be able to estimate the history of failed motors."
"Our understanding of the dielectric behavior of layered magnet wire insulations has progressed to the point where meaningful correlations have been established between the dissipation factor and those magnet wire properties that are vital for its performance. This paper discusses how these correlations can be used to tune in a wire enameling machine to produce amideimide overcoated polyester magnet wire with significantly improved reliability."
"The lineage of our group goes back to 1957. While attending the AIEE Fall Meeting, P.L. Algers from General Electric Company was requested to organize a new subcommittee. The purpose of this subcommittee was to develop an AIEE test procedure for the evaluation of the insulation of hermetic motors. The procedure was to be similar to AIEE No. 510 motorette test procedure; however, the environment conditions were to be based on conditions to which hermetic motor insulation is exposed. The first organizational meeting of this subcommittee was held on February 5,1958, at the Statler Hilton in New York City."
"Recently, environments and conditions where electric equipment are used have become more severe, and the constructions of bigger plants have become unavoidable in order to manufacture larger capacity machines. On the other hand, it is strongly requested to have maintenance-free, smaller and lighter equipment for the purpose of rationalization of the enterprises."
"The trend toward treating complete stators with a solventless resin in a vacuum pressure cycle has gained considerable support in the electrical power apparatus industry. (Fig. 1), When the decision was made at E-M to develop such a system for form wound motors and generators, a number of original objectives were outlined as a guide for the project. Many of the characteristics desired by E-M were not available in existing systems."
"The past decade has witnessed increasing utilization of the post impregnation concept of processing stator windings. The projections initially made as to the ability of post impregnated windings to, endure against moisture, chemical, and other unfavorable environments have been substantiated by prolonged and varied service experience(1,2). Limitations imposed on the extent of post impregnation processing have been 1) physical size of motors exceeding the handling capacity of the manufacturer's equipment, and 2) voltage rating, the higher voltage windings necessitating more stringent attention to power factor requisites and methods of suppressing corona discharges at coil insulation surfaces. While these electrical requirements deserve particular attention in the design of high voltage insulation to avoid premature degradation, the windings are subjected to the same environments as lower voltage windings, and the insulation system must be adapted to provide integral protection against unfavorable operational conditions. If materials and processing used for the lower voltage windings could be adapted to accommodate the particular requirements of high voltage insulation, it would result in a high voltage system with a proven degree of physical reliability. By incorporating a proven system, assurance of physical and environmental endurance could be accepted on the basis of service experience, obviating the need to extrapolate from accelerated laboratory simulations. By defming the requirements and using a system approach, an insulation system for post impregnation processing of motor windings up to ratings of 15,000 volts has been developed and is in current use."
"One of the biggest problems encountered in the production of universal or D.C. electric motors has been the method and practice of joining the armature's coil wires to the commutator. For years most manufactuers either soft soldered or brazed the coil wires to the commutator. This was fairly acceptable before 1950, when electric motor production was quite low. As consumer demand increased for low cost, reliable and safe motors, to be used in household appliances and automotive applications, most manufacturers realized that the only way to eliminate the problems encountered with soft soldering or brazing was through commutator fusing."
"Moisture and associated contaminates such as dirt and salt, can cause failure of electrical insulation by bridging cracks in embrittled insulation or cause failure by providing paths to ground. Previous Navy work reported by Flaherty and Walker 1 showed that failures can be moved into the end turns of windings by lap folding the slot cells to provide a long path to ground. In the 1961 report insulation systems were given a rating in accordance with their moisture resistance with the totally encapsulated winding providing the best protection. This study was followed by later work by Flaherty, Tobin and Walker2-3 in 1968 which compared varnish procedures using conventional solvent type varnishes and 100% solids varnishes using the trickle process. This work showed that the trickle process provided moisture protection equivalent to three dips and bakes in the solvent type varnish."
"Rubber electrical tapes have conventionally been used to repair, connect and terminate power lines. They are still economical to use in many cases under 5 KV; however, at 5 KV to 35 KV molded electrical connectors can accomplish the same job with greater electrical integrity in less than one-half the time. Building a tape connection splice is not only time consuming, but demands highly skilled labor which is not required when molded connectors are used."
"This paper evaluates the performance of a newly designed cable splicing system with a unique connector design. Comprehensive short and long term test data are presented. Special features of the splicing system and their contribution to the performance of the splicing system are discussed."
"Recently, a great variety of organic insulating materials has been, used as insulators in electric power cables. Since these devices are, being used at increasingly higher voltages and powers, the tree-like, breakdown phenomenon due to cracks and impurities in insulators, has become a serious problem. Plastic insulators containing cracks, and impurities have a greatly reduced lifetime. This is because the dielectric constant inside a cavity is lower than that on the outside, and the electric field tends to concentrate locally in the cavity. The, treeing phenomenon is found in thick materials and both the growth, and shape of trees depend on a corona streamer generated in narrow, channels of several microns in width. It is considered that the, growth of a tree forms by intrinsic and thermal breakdown due to, the high electric field at the tip of the tree caused by the growth of, a corona streamer1."
"Polyurethane elastomeric compounds may be cast into many sizes and shapes of industrial parts, varying from a few ounces to many hundreds of pounds. They bring to electrical manufacturers tough, semi-resilient elastomeric compounds which can absorb high impact and mechanical abuse without fracturing. With correct selection of materials, one can offer products that will be satisfactory at very low to moderately high temperatures and, at the same time, will be exemplary under high humidity conditions. Good temperature performance and resistance to reversion under high humidities are two important criteria which must be fulfilled by cast urethane insulators in addition to the usual mechanical and electrical requirements. Many of the earlier developments in urethanes failed to recognize reversion, usually manifested by a softening and depolymerization into a sticky liquid under high humidities. This objection has been overcome by new grades of urethanes reviewed in this paper."
"Considerable work has been done in recent years to develop test methods for estimating the tracking and erosion performance of organic insulating materials, when they are exposed to surface pollution. On the basis of this experience it has been generally agreed that surface discharges can be looked upon as heat sources and their effect on the surface as thermal. The view has been held that knowledge of the chemical structure of organic insulating materials, their thermal decomposition and the characteristics of the decomposition products of the materials is of primary importance in determining the tendency to surface tracking."
"The availability of acceptable outdoor insulators that will meet the electrical and mechanical requirements for EHV transmission systems presents a complex and unsolved problem. A considerable effort has been spent toward developing a single material with suitable mechanical strength and long-term insulating stability. The unlikelihood of finding such a material has prompted the concept of a composite insulator where two materials are combined to perform the total insulator function, one for mechanical strength and the other for surface stability and long term electrical insulation. This paper deals with the electrical insulating function and classification of materials best suited for outdoor insulators based on their surface behavior in a high voltage and simulated wet, outdoor environment."
"One of the problems with the introduction of new cable insulating compounds is to find realistic tests to evaluate them. During the last four years, a considerable amount of testing of two contemporary insulations has been conducted at the authors' laboratories and we feel that it is now possible to define a testing procedure to differentiate between different compounds of these insulations."
"This paper is the second in an expected series of papers dealing with the problem of evaluating wet surface conductance and its effects on insulators and insulation in outdoor and simulated outdoor conditions. During rain and dew and fog insulators are wetted, and their surfaces become conducting in varying degree. Measurements of insulator surface conductivities in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area outdoors and in salt fog chambers were described in the first paper of this series.1 In this paper, the investigation has been extended to evaluating surface conductance levels at various U.S. locations and under different types of precipitation conditions."
"The thermal life studies are presented on a number of transformer insulation systems for equipment up to 500 KVA. Thermal classifications from 105 to 220 C are covered. The data is compiled from transformer models (transformerettes) using IEEE #117 techniques (developed for motorettes) modified for indoor and outdoor transformer conditions as approved by Underwriters' Laboratories who recognized the classifications following submission of the data. Both copper and aluminum conductors are evaluated. These evaluations apply to both pad mount installations and underground residential distribution systems for both indoor and outdoor exposures."
"An instrument has been developed which provides a direct reading of the power factor of new and used insulating liquids with accuracy comparable to laboratory types. A unique bridge circuit is employed at fixed high voltage excitation at power line frequency which permits guarded cell measurements to be made, both in the instrument chamber itself or remotely at the end of a guarded shielded cable. The instrument is portable and double shielded to minimize electrostatic interference experienced in power distribution on-site measurements. Dielectric constants can also be determined. Problems involved in maintaining accuracy at high ambient relative humidities are also discussed."
"The insulation resistance of oil-impregnated-paper sheets has been determined as a function of temperature, dc field application time and test frequency in the range from 1.0 down to 0.01 Hz. The results have shown that if the true dc insulation resistance is to be derived from the low frequency ac measurements, low frequency test data well below 0.01 Hz is required."
"Mineral oil and askarel have been in general use in transformers, capacitors, cables, and switchgear for many decades. With the exception of polybutenes, no other dielectric liquids have gained acceptance for use in high voltage power apparatus, primarily because oil and askarel are so inexpensive and possess such excellent electrical properties in combination with kraft paper."
"In this age of environmental concern, there is an increasing need for a quick diagnostic test to determine the potential of a chemical to biodegrade. Of particular interest to the insulation engineer is the degree of biodegradability of certain types of liquid dielectrics such as the askarels or similar-type liquids which are of considerable importance to the transformer and capacitor industries. In developing new liquids for such applications, a quick test will be useful for the organic chemist in planning his future syntheses work. Since the test will come early in the development program, it must be routine and capable of screening a large number of materials with relative ease."
"This paper considers hazards to personnel and apparatus caused by the use of high voltage techniques of fault finding on power cables."
"This paper presents results of SF6 insulation strength studies, statistical breakdown studies in SF6 and thermal aging of epoxy insulators all in a compressed gas cable or bus (hereafter gas cable) configuration. In addition, the insulation aspects of field installation and field testing are discussed."
"In a composite dielectric under ac voltages, the electric stress distribution is governed by the values of the dielectric constants of individual components. This concept, termed \"grading\" has been used in the past to grade the stress distribution in order to obtain the maximum economic utilization of the entire body of the insulation in a number of applications, e.g. cables, bushings."
"The development of insulating materials for solid dielectric cables has been rapid and at a constant accelerating rate. This effort has resulted in solid dielectric cables becoming a reliable and economic method of power transmission and distribution at ever increasing voltages."
"The rate of growth of electrical power generation and distribution in the United States is so large that the electrical systems in use, should be almost continuously reevaluated in search of better alternatives. One pressing need is for an alternative to large overhead systems. One obvious alternative is underground cable, but practically all facets of present underground systems could stand improvement. There is a need for UG systems with: (a) greater power handling capacity, (b) less loss, (c) smaller capacitance per unit length, (d) lower cost, and (e) better heat dissipation. And the optimum solution might not be in cables at all."
"During the past twenty-five years since the discovery of the transistor, the development of the semiconductor device technology has been very rapid. The availability of improved devices permitted the design and fabrication of new and more complex electronic circuits and systems which required new methods for assembly of the electronic components of these circuits."
"The dual in-line package has become the commonplace integrated circuit package of today-very much as the octal-based vacuum tube was a standard of yesterday. The dip, as it has come to be called, employs dual rows of leads which provide both the electrical interface and the mechanical retention. Each year better than one-half billion are manufactured and become active circuit components in all kinds of electronic equipment."
"This paper is somewhat tutorial in nature although the results shown here are derived from the thermal analysis of a specific microwave power transistor. Computer-aided thermal simulation techniques are used to derive heat transfer characteristics and to estimate the operating temperature of the device for a time varying sequence of power pulses. The technique and results are discussed to point out important thermal effects that occur and are common to most semiconductor devices. Points of interest include the temperature distribution both on and within the chip, effects of temperature dependent material properties, the effect of adding a heat spreader under the chip, and finally, the meaning and significance of the effective thermal time constant for the junction, the chip, the carrier and other parts of the electronic package. Some effects of unwitting temperature measurement by experimental techniques are also indicated where appropriate. These results form somewhat of a sequel to an earlier paper, which discussed similar results for other semiconductor devices. The main difference of this device compared with those in the earlier paper is that the effective junction time constant is much shorter since it is only on the order of 50 ms. As a result, junction temperature excursions become quite large even for power pulses of only several microseconds duration."
"Early in the search for an effective replacement for the chip and wire bonding method for interconnecting large numbers of integrated circuit chips in a single package, the idea of a beam-leaded substrate was suggested. This technique utilizes substrates with apertures to accommodate the integrated circuit chips. The interconnections on the substrate terminate in integral beam leads which overhand the chip apertures. The beam leads are eventually bonded directly to the pads of the integrated circuits. The more significant advantages of beam-leaded substrates over other alternatives to chip and wire bonding (e.g. beam-leaded devices and flip chip devices) are excellent heat sinking since the chips and substrate can be mounted on a suitable heat sink, a virtually unlimited selection of chips since devices of all types of terminal metallurgy can be utilized by choosing the appropriate beam-lead material, and a planar bonding surface for easy bond inspection and incapsulation. In addition, the beam-leaded substrate approach, along with the beam-leaded device and the flip-chip device, reduces the number of bonds by a factor of two in comparison with the chip and wire method of chip interconnection."
"Although explosive energy has been used for a number of years to produce large scale, solid phase bonds, its small scale use entails unique problems. Current studies have dealt with these problems, producing a safe, reliable bonding method scaled to the needs of the electronics industry."
"A new era of electronic packaging is upon us. Some ten years ago we were wire bonding discrete transistors to substrates to form what was termed hybrid circuits. As the technology advanced, integrated circuits became the watchword and have taken a commanding position in the digital, memory and linear marketplaces. Packaging of these integrated circuits has virtually all related to aluminum or gold wire bonding to either metal headers, flatpacks, ceramic DIPs or plastic DIPs. In turn, these packages for the most part have been connected to substrates by such techniques as wave soldering or wire wrapping. Selected companies are involved in handling integrated circuit die at the hybrid substrate level, but they either represent large, captive companies with their own flip chip process and a huge capital investment or small hybrid houses that are wire bonding small quantity orders. It would appear that the state of the art of integrated circuits has surpassed that of packaging. But today a new technique of bonding, that eliminates wires or flying leads, and is more than cost competitive, is becoming available. This new bonding technique is one that allows an integrated circuit die to have all of its leads simultaneously bonded to inner lead conductors on a continuous, flexible substrate. The die is then encapsulated and the outer lead bonds of the substrate are attached to the outside word after testing of the individual substrate frame. Not only has wire bonding been eliminated, but we now have a low cost packaging technique that lends itself to all levels of integration including semiconductor, components, sub-systems and systems houses. At present this technique, as described, is being used in the new Polaroid SX-70 camera."
"The rapid progress in reliability and performance of electronic equipment in recent years calls for further improvement in circuit density, reliability and electrical properties of printed circuit boards on which IC or LSI is installed. This problem can be solved only by new development in such as board material, plating, and manufacturing process and technologies."
"The results of a study to thermally characterize the laminating process for multilayer printed wiring boards (MLB's) are presented. The temperature in MLB's is determined both as a function of three-dimensional location and of time. The study is carried out experimentally using 1 mil (0.025 mm) diameter thermocouples imbedded into the epoxy/glass prepreg layers. MLB's with 5 and 15 conducting layers are studied for the \"hot press\" laminating process, for which the MLB lay-ups are inserted between the hot press platens (360°F/182°C). The results show that whereas for 5 layer MLB's the epoxy/glass prepreg layer temperatures are practically identical, the prepreg layers in 15 layer MLB's show temperature differences in excess of 37°F (20.5°C). It is shown that these temperature differences are also strongly dependent on the time lag between lay-up insertion and the closing of the press. This time lag can be as small as 4 seconds under laboratory conditions and typically 80 seconds for multi-opening production presses. Other effects which are reported include those of padding thickness and production conditions. It is further shown that these temperature differences, which can be the cause of laminating problems such as voids, cured thickness variations, measle tendencies, and delaminations, can result in high proportions of defective MLB's; but can be reduced by increasing the padding thickness or employing the \"cold press\" laminating process."
"Measurements of temperature histories of epoxy/glass prepreg layers during multilayer printed wiring board lamination have been recently obtained. In the present paper, it is shown that the temperature histories may be predicted by an analysis of the transient heat flow process within the MLB. The analysis requires a knowledge of the press platen temperature history during laminations and the thermal resistance of the padding material. Theoretically predicted results show close agreement with the experimental data for both 5 layer and 15 layer MLB's using the \"hot press\" as well as the \"cold press\" cycles. The present method may be used in the design of MLB lay-ups, in particular the determination of the necessary padding thickness to achieve heating rates which give adequate timing \"windows\" for cure pressure applications. The present theory has been applied to study the effect of kraft paper padding on the prepreg temperatures. Results are shown for both 15 and 5 layer laminations employing the hot press as well as cold press cycles. The number of kraft paper sheets used is shown to have a significant bearing on the temperatures."
"Since the discovery of condensation polyimide resins in the early 1960's, engineers in all fields of endeavor have sought to prepare composite parts where maximum use could be made of their exciting properties. Typical attributes include: high heat resistance (500°F and up), good mechanical properties, outstanding dimensional stability, excellent electricals, chemical inertness, low out-gassing, radiation and cryogenic temperature stability, and inherent nonflammability. These attempts were frequently thwarted, however, by discouraging resin processability. Indeed, extensive and complex cure and post-bake cycles are required and strict adherence to fabrication parameters is demanded. Several years of further research have resulted in commercialization of a new class of polyimide resins-addition types."
"Conformal coating materials and processes were comparatively tested and evaluated for protection of electronic equipment. An extensive literature search was conducted for various generic types of conformal coating materials and processes. Testing and evaluation of candidate coating systems were accomplished using printed circuitry coupons, critical components, electronic assemblies, and flexible printed wiring circuitry to determine retention of electrical properties after temperature and humidity conditioning."
"A new silicone conformal coating resin has recently been developed by Dow Corning Corporation. The principal advantages of this new silicone coating are the improved toughness and the hard, dirt-resistant surface of the cured film while retaining the excellent thermal and electrical characteristics typical of silicone coatings. Silicone coatings have become popular in the electronics industry because of their durability. Although most electronic coatings possess adequate electrical properties, silicone polymers have demonstrated a remarkable ability to retain their physical and electrical properties over wide extremes of temperatures, humidity, and other adverse environmental conditions. In the past, however, silicone coatings were limited to two types. Silicone resins, usually requiring extensive heat cures, have been widely used as coatings and impregnants for the electrical industry. Silicone elastomers have been popular where extreme flexibility and faster cure have been necessary. The new resin has been designed to complete the continuum of available silicone polymers by providing a coating with the toughness and hardness of rigid silicone resins and some of the flexibility and processing advantages of silicone elastomers."
"In the manufacture of multilayer printed circuit boards, drilling is one of the major contributors to processing error. A study was conducted to determine the positional accuracy of drilled holes and the significant sources of error which caused the drilling inaccuracies."
"This paper presents the results of a variety of voltage breakdown measurements performed on flexible printed circuits. Data were taken for a range of linewidths and spacings, for different qualities of etched features, for a range of temperature and humidity, and for circuits with and without a protective covercoat. The speed with which the flashover process develops was also investigated. Although the primary emphasis is on fineline circuits (linewidth and spacing around 10 mils), some data is presented for spacings up to 45 mils. This program was undertaken to determine the voltage breakdown characteristics of printed backplane circuits. In certain telephone applications, such circuits may be exposed to lightning-induced surges, voltage pulses of approximately 1 kV. The results presented here should be of interest to designers concerned with the overvoltage characteristics of flexible printed wiring, and particularly to those concerned with circuit protection requirements."
"In addition to its excellent insulating properties, non-flammability, and resistance to solvents, Kapton® polyimide film possesses a high degree of thermal and mechanical toughness to withstand flexible circuitry processing conditions. It has, therefore, found application in flexible flat cables,1 multi-layers,2 IC chip carriers,3 and even in printed circuits of the Polaroid SX-70 and Kodak XL-33, XL-55 cameras4."
"The temperature resistance of components has steadily increased. Circuits have become increasingly complex. Plated through holes are almost universally used for interplane connections. To improve reliability, multilayer wiring boards which are more heat resistant, more dimensionally stable, and have better electrical properties at high frequencies are needed. While it is possible that commonly used epoxy systems will be improved, many needs can only be met by a totally new resin system. Anticipating that need, RADC has undertaken a comprehensive study program evaluating polyimide resin systems, and comparing them with the commonly used epoxy systems. Polyimide resins are presently available in three types, each having different methods of polymerization. They are addition cure systems, pyrolytic systems, and condensation systems."
"Today's trend toward \"hybrid packaging\" of electronic assemblies - a combination of multiple layers of mother boards and point-to-point wiring - has focused attention on methods of mass attachment of interconnect posts to printed circuit boards. In \"hybrid packaging\" these posts play a vital role in providing connections between boards and interconnections to other components in the system. Normally, posts are inserted through the board and make contact to voltage planes, ground planes and signal traces by mechanical interference force-fitting, or by soldering. Additional interconnections can then be made to the posts using wrapped wire techniques or TERMI-POINT clip terminations*."
"Base metal pins (usually nickel or copper alloy) plated with gold or other precious metals are found on most printed circuit boards. Usually these pins are formed in some manner after they are inserted into the PC board. The more common metal forming operations are staking, squaring, flattening and bending. It is imperative that damage to the previous metal plating be minimized during secondary forming."
"Reflow soldering consists of two basic processing steps. The first step is to assemble the parts to be joined, including the placement of sufficient solder where appropriate to make the interconnections. When soldering circuits to terminals this solder is normally in the form of doughnuts, called solder preforms, which are placed over the terminals. The second step is to provide a thermal heating cycle which will melt or \"reflow\" the prepositioned solder to join the metallic elements together. If all the parts in the assembly can withstand soldering temperatures, the assembly can be heated to a uniform temperature by convective heating utilizing fluids such as air or polyethylene glycol. This paper describes a unique radiant heating technique which has been developed to reflow solder heat sensitive flexible circuits to terminals mounted in dielectrics which cannot withstand soldering temperatures. The process has been utilized for producing mass interconnections between epoxy-glass or epoxy-polyester flexible circuits and terminal posts mounted in glass-reinforced polycarbonate connectors. This manufacturing process gives the designer the opportunity to utilize low cost and high impact strength materials, which could not previously be considered because of their poor thermal properties."
"Multilayer test boards have been fabricated into Stack-Assembled Multiple Multilayer (SAMM) backplane structures. Their crosstalk behavior, signal lead characteristic impedance, and the discontinuities caused by interboard vias have been characterized as a function of the separation between boards."
"As the complexity of computer technology increases, we find a trend towards tremendously increased circuit speeds. In earlier system types, the major percentage of logic delay was associated with circuit propagation delay. Now however, circuit interconnect often represents the major portion of system delay."
"I have collated the relative properties of the newer fluoropolymers and the newly available flame-retardant polyesters, and have charted the comparative properties to aid the potential user in specifying these materials for use as insulating materials. A comparison is made between these materials and FEP, covering mechanical, electrical and thermal properties. A cost comparison guides the user in his consideration of these materials."
"Many flexible printed circuits serve as a moving part and are subjected to constant or intermittent rolling, hinging, twisting, or other flexural stress during lifetime usage. These stresses may eventually result in a fatigue failure of one or more of the conductor patterns."
"Thermal stressing of plated-through-holes (PTH) is an everyday occurrence in the manufacture of multilayer circuit cards. Thermal shock produced by manufacturing processes such as wave solder and component rework has been responsible for mechanical failures in PTH."
"Selecting the laminate that is best suited for a particular stripline design can present a problem to the microwave engineer. Reliability, processability, cost and other factors place certain demands on the choice of laminate. Each engineer wants the greatest performance for the least cost. To make the correct choice, an evaluation of many laminate properties should be considered."
"A specific need arose for the terminating resistors of an X-band circulator to be integral with the ferrite metallization. The ferrite was gadolinium doped yttrium iron garnet. The need was related to both improved performance, since the impedance desired was purely resistive, and to lower fabrication costs with the elimination of discrete chip resistors and their associated test, mounting, and bonding procedures. Tantalum was selected as the thin film resistor material because of its stability and because trimming to a desired resistance is straightforward. This stability is greatest in the range from 50 to 100 ohms per square. The uniqueness of this application lies in the use of electron beam techniques with reactive deposition and doping of tantalum to produce thin film resistors on a ferrite."
"A series of alumina substrates were prepared with controlled variation of normal parameters - alumina content, density, forming method, and minor constituents. Variations in dielectric constant at X-band frequencies were determined by different methods, including microwave cavities, and the results interpreted."
"The studies reported in this paper were undertaken to determine: 1. The variation with temperature of apparent dielectric constant and dissipation factor of copper clad TFE-glass. 2. The feasibility of bonding stripline circuit boards together with thermoplastic, pressure sensitive, or thermosetting bonding films in order to eliminate clamping variations inherent in the use of eyelets and screws and to eliminate the weight of screws and clamping plates. 3. The effect of thermocycling, mechanical vibration, and humidity on the stability of apparent dielectric constant of packages bonded by various methods."
"A transition from conventional molt'-manganese metallizing to sputter coating metallizing has been successfully made. The new process allows a substantial upgrading of tube performance and is now incorporated as a permanent manufacturing process."
"An X-Band stripline dielectric constant and dissipation factor test method (now incorporated into Mil-P-13949E) was subjected to a round-robin test program by a Task Group of A.S.T.M. Committee D09.12.03 to determine interlaboratory reproducibility. Ten laboratories, many with no previous experience, participated, testing 30 samples of stripline materials. Excellent reproducibility was demonstrated."
"This paper reviews some of the methods used to keep the cost of these devices minimal while retaining their reliability. The recent application of laser technology to the manufacture of thin film microwave circuits and the advantages realized through this application will be discussed at length."
"Beryllium oxide possesses highly desired physical properties for microwave application. Examples are presented to correct misconceptions regarding its cost effectiveness. Safe handling procedures are discussed. New research developments are disclosed."
"An RF manifold is in general a passive device which effects the distribution of microwave signals in a prescribed fashion. It must accomplish this power distribution with a high efficiency and maintain this level of performance over a prescribed frequency band. In order to achieve high efficiency, it must employ a low loss transmission medium and maintain control of the amplitude and phase of the signals as they pass through the assembly. Other design constraints which significantly affect the electrical performance are volumetric, structural and environmental considerations as well as reproducibility and weight."
"High velocity aircraft, missiles, and rockets require conformai, thin antennas. Ideally, an antenna \"paper thin\" would best suit the aerodynamic and mechanical engineer. This antenna would neither, disturb the aerodynamic flow, nor would it protrude inwardly to disrupt the mechanical structure."
"This report discusses the assembly of hybrid circuits for large microwave packages. Emphasis is placed on materials compatibility and process integrity. Particular attention is given to the differences in coefficients of thermal expansion and the use of stress relief between dissimilar materials. The author stresses the importance of Process Engineering involvement, considering first the end-product hardware package design, then adapting to that design the designs and processes necessary to produce the product's components, beginning with the hybrid substrate. The report proposes a model for examination of discrete component mounting and the factors affecting microwave unit assembly."
"Stripline microwave integrated circuits generally require packaging in precision-machined metal cases for mechanical protection, and to provide shielding of electromagnetic radiation. Since, for couplers, the metal cases increase the unit cost approximately 40-80%, a less expensive packaging method is needed. This paper describes the use of conductive epoxy to package microwave units."
"This presentation is a general discussion of completed and current investigations of the arc plasma spray (APS) as a technique for producing improved and more economical electronic devices."
"There are many problems related to repeatability and the standardization of test results in evaluating rigid foam. Techniques were sought to determine the most suitable foams for encapsulating electronic modules containing discrete electrical components. The amount of foam flowing into intricate cavities varies with the foam and the specific configuration. This study sought to evaluate methods of determining the ability of resin to flow through restricted and intricate flow paths. Current foam evaluation problems include those of whether molds should be open or closed, and how molds should be loaded, since foams can be made to give strength variations of 3 to 1, depending on the preparation techniques. Density variations of almost 2 to 1 may result, depending on the openness of the mold."
"During the Test and Integration phase of the NASA Skylab space vehicle it was recognized that the high voltage equipment and experiments used for electronic sensing and power generation, could be corona susceptible. Some of those spacecraft sensors and circuits were found to be sensitive to very low-level signals such as produced by partial discharges or corona. A massive discharge such as a corona burst or arc could degrade some of the information or malfunction a circuit. Therefore it was deemed necessary to determine which experiments and equipment aboard Skylab were susceptible to the partial discharges or corona and establish by test and analysis their threshold of corona susceptibility."
"The Continuous Current Monitoring Device (CCMD) for evaluating potting compounds was first reported in 19561. It was developed at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory by R. W. Warfield and associates, and is based upon electrical resistivity measurement techniques. Studies were made initially on the polymerization of various cross-linked resin systems to determine curing characteristics, exothermic effects, proper cure temperatures, and the overall activation energies (Ea) for the polymerization process2. The CCMD was then applied to the cured systems to measure electrical resistivity properties as a function of temperature. From this data the nature of the cross-linked structure and activation energy (Ec) for the electrical conduction process were derived, and the presence of second order transitions (Tg) within the temperature range studied were noted.3, 4"
"A series of polyolefin based thermoplastic rubber materials called TPR* is being offered to the wire and cable industry for primary insulation and jacketing applications. These materials are unique to the industry because they provide the economic benefits normally associated with thermoplastic processing, but produce finished products with the properties of vulcanized rubber. Extrusion grade polymers for the wire and cable industry were first evaluated in the field in late 1972. Some of the more promising opportunities found for these thermoplastic rubbers in electrical insulation applications, as well as their physical properties, and economic opportunities are discussed."
"This article is intended as an evaluation guide in selection of “lightweight” wire for use in electronic harnesses and cables. The use of small sized “lightweight” wire in electronic interconnection harnesses is an important and increasing trend. High-density crimp-type connectors are now specified for most major military programs. It is the need to reduce harness bulk behind high density connectors that is the major reason for using small diameter wires."
"The susceptibility of electronic components to climatic, dynamic, and electrical environments is an important consideration in automotive applications. Environmental testing, to simulate extreme conditions encountered in actual service, is thus necessary to qualify the components. Field data are given."
"One promising partial approach to many of our anticipated future transportation problems is the automation of various facets of ground transportation. This could include automated captive-vehicle systems for central-business-district circulation, dual-mode vehicle systems for urban area use, and intercity automated highways. Certain control functions are critical in such systems and the development of new technology will be required for their successful implementation. The functions include network control and both the automatic longitudinal and lateral control of individual vehicles. Current component developments, which are directed toward such functions will be described, together with the results of roadway testing. Several problem areas, which are related to the electrical properties of conventional construction materials, are defined together with preferred operating environments for electrical components and materials."
"A microwave system using the second harmonic reflection principle is being used as a basis for an automobile labeling system. This system is capable of accommodating over 100 million different codes and can read a vehicle passing at full speed from a distance of up to ten feet. Very loose tolerances for the interrogator-responder distance and orientation are required. Optical systems and loop in the roadway systems were considered but they do not appear to have the capability of identifying one in over 100 million vehicles moving at highway speeds. The only optical system that is known to have the capability is one designed to read RR cars but that system uses a label about 7\" × 18\", which is believed to be much too large for use on private cars. The microwave system to be described in this paper uses a label which in its initial design is 6\" × 3\" × 7/8\". It is expected to be made even smaller in later designs. Systems operation and circuit design will be presented. This system is expected to have application to automatic billing at toll booths thus avoiding the long traffic delays that occur there at rush hours. It is also expected to aid in anti-hijacking operations and in the recovery of lost and stolen vehicles."
"The concurrent growing demands for increased safety, emission control and diagnostic inspection of cars, along with the consumer search for fuel economy will force the auto manufacturers to integrate the growing number of automative electronic devices into a single control package."
"This paper will review current methods employed for vacuum deposition of polymeric thin films. parylene, the generic name for vacuum deposited poly-p-xylylene, will be emphasized. Vacuum deposition techniques have received attention because of their unique ability to form very thin insulating coatings for a variety of applications. Such films serve as dielectric coatings for circuit boards, capacitors, thermistors, and other electrical and electronic assemblies, including hybrid microelectronics. Outstanding dielectric properties coupled with true conformality and uniformity of coverage make Parylene an attractive choice for these and other end uses."
"The procedures and the resulting real-time holographic interferograms of three specific studies are presented using both photographic and thin protochromic films: (i) The heat conduction of a spacer used for mounting transistors on a heat sink, (ii) the detection of inner layer short-circuits on a multilayer printed circuit board, and (iii) the detection of a hot spot on a hybrid IC ceramic substrate. Methods of preparing photochromic thin films are described. A 2-minute silent movie of real-time holographic interferometry utilizing photochromic material will be shown."
"Electrophoretic deposition is a coating technique based on the migration of charged suspended colloidal polymer particles under the influence of a low d-c voltage to the part being coated which is usually the anode. This paper presents significant aspects of the electrophoretic deposition technique. Particular attention is given to: 1. A discussion of the colloidal polymer particle in aqueous suspension. 2. The relationship of structure and function of various polymer latices. 3. The experimental set up for examining the electrophoretic phenomena. The economic, selective, and unique advantages of electrophoretic deposition are compared with conventional coating technologies. Design applications and fabrication techniques are described."
"The increasing use of epoxy in microelectronic applications brings up more frequent conflicts between those who are biased against its use and those who are convinced that it is the only way to go. The purpose of this paper is to separate facts from rumor and opinion to normalize this variance."
"The corrosivity of adhesives (and other organic materials) used in electronic devices should be a major concern of both the manufacturer of these devices, and the supplier of the materials. This can be dramatized by the fact that almost all room temperature curing epoxy adhesives tested are corrosive. Many of the currently used corrosion and insulation resistance tests can at best yield incomplete information. The non-electrolytic or panel corrosion tests, for example, may provide completely false information for materials to be used as electrical insulators, and the short polarization time of the typical insulation resistance test leaves much to be learned about a material's long-term service capabilities. The electrolytic test discussed can, in addition to appraising the corrosive attributes of an adhesive, also yield information on degree of cure and the effect of curing environment. This work has suggested a possible factor which influences the long-term durability of adhesive joints, and preliminary studies have indicated the value of further exploration. The importance of humidity to the development of adhesive-induced electrolytic corrosion has been demonstrated. Additionally, the amount of corrosion (or corrosivity of the adhesive) is strongly influenced by the adhesive formulation and cure history, but to a lesser degree by the electrode material, where even the noble metals are subject to corrosion."
"Epoxies are quite common commercially, and they can now be used in the assembly of high reliability hybrid microcircuits. The most recent advancements in epoxy technology even permits its use for device bonding in military and spaceflight applications-provided there is adequate documentation of process control. A NASA paper, released in 1972, states: “Epoxy cements of both liquid and dry film types (preforms) produce satisfactory bonds for Classes “A,” “B,” and “C,” spaceflight microcircuit applications.” This use encourages passive chip component attachment with nonconductive epoxies and discourages electrically conductive adhesives in Class “A” circuits until further research can be conducted."
"The ease with which a preform of film adhesive can be used in hybrid circuits makes it appear a desirable method for bonding components to substrates. Another reason that this type of adhesion appears desirable is its high bond strengths. These two advantages of film adhesives over other standard epoxies may be overshadowed by their possible corrosiveness to hybrid metallizations and their catastrophic effects in the presence of humidity. The idea is not to eliminate film epoxies, but to properly evaluate their effects prior to use in hybrid circuits. Previously accepted tests for epoxies used in hybrids are the measurement of outgassing properties, weight losses, adhesive strength of bonds, and any effects caused by thermal shock. For a more complete evaluation of an epoxy, one must expose the cured epoxy to a humidity test and a standard corrosion test. The effects of humidity and the corrosive effects of a film epoxy were investigated with very unusual results. The type of film adhesive used was made from an epoxy impregnated fiberglass cloth. The epoxy resin and hardener used were previously tested for humidity effects and corrosive effects with satisfactory results. The addition of the fiberglass or another unknown drastically changed the results of the test. Exposing the film adhesive to humidity caused the film to lose its bond strength. Further investigation showed that the film became intensely corrosive in the presence of an electrical potential difference at elevated temperatures. These two results have shown that it can be potentially dangerous to use a film epoxy without proper testing."
"That tiny, almost invisible dot of adhesive that bonds a chip to the substrate in a microelectronic device has been a major headache to the adhesives industry. Never before has it been necessary to design so many critical properties into a single adhesive. A customer pays for and expects to receive the perfect product, an optimum chip adhesive. Unfortunately, the optimum chip adhesive had not yet been and may never be developed. Much progress toward that end has been made in the past several years and will continue. Still, perfection is not apparent. No adhesive manufacturer has yet been able to include all of the essential requirements into a single chip adhesive, without significant compromise or trade-off."
"The purpose of this paper is to briefly review the principles of partial discharge phenomena and measurement as they apply to the insulation of electronic systems. The paper then considers the advantages of measurement at power frequencies with alternating voltage or with direct voltage as opposed to measurement at higher frequencies and complex waveforms."
"The complex dielectric constant and permeability of materials may be obtained simultaneously over a band of up to two decades in frequency by measuring the response of a sample of the material to a very short electrical pulse. This paper reviews recent applications of such methods at Sperry Research Center and at other laboratories within an overall range of 10 MHz to 13 GHz, discussing current capabilities and mentioning possible future developments."
"This paper describes a unique new approach to characterizing polymer cure by monitoring the accompanying changes in dielectric properties. The instrument, called AUDREY®2 (short for Automatic DielecRomEtrY) uses a capacitative probe to track the cure characteristics. Hence, dielectric analysis can be performed either on materials in a standard test cell for qualifying incoming resins or, alternately, in dies and molds so that it can be used for on-line measurement of these materials during their final forming operations."
"This paper describes a new principle of measurement for the insulation resistance of capacitors and other capacitive specimens. The need for such an instrument became apparent for high-speed testing of capacitors as part of the production process. High-speed instruments are available for the measurement of capacitance, tan delta, dissipation factor, or Q; but no suitable instrument has been available for the measurement of insulation resistance."
"The goal of this study was to develop a simple method for determining the dependence of dielectric constant and loss index on frequency in the range 10 MHz to 200 MHz for a number of dielectrically lossy liquid resins. First, a test cell was devised which could be used with an available Hewlett-Packard RX meter. The calculations were then worked out based on a calibration of cell constants and series inductance determined with five standard liquids. Data on five commercial resins and four curing agents is given. The method provides 5% or better accuracy up to 200 MHz."
"This paper describes a test fixture and test method for making relative comparisons of the shielding effectiveness of a variety of coaxial cable shield configurations."

"The Electromagnetic Compatibility Analysis Center (ECAC) is a Department of Defense (DoD), facility located at Annapolis, Maryland serving the Military Services and other agencies of DoD. ECAC was established on July 19, 1960, as a major part of the Department of Defense attack on the operational and developmental aspects of the radio frequency compatibility problem. ECAC is the only functional analysis center in the free world devoted primarily to the inter-system and system-to-environment electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) problem and, as such, it provides the U.S. Government, through the DoD, with a significant advantage in developing and deploying complex systems."

"The generation of an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) by a nuclear burst in the exosphere is described. The effects of the EMP on various devices and systems are of concern to the communications/ electronics community. Lightning protection systems do not offer assured protection from EMP induced voltages. Methods of testing are discussed briefly and simulators are described. Protective measures are based on techniques presently in use by EMC engineers."
     "Summary form only given. The increasingly severe electromagnetic interference environment that is found in hospitals today, together with difficulties of electrical power line fluctuations, pose problems of sufficient magnitude for medical electronic instruments. The problem is a dual one: that of assuring satisfactory operation of sensitive instrumentation within this hostile environment, and the opposite one of assuring that each newly introduced instrument does not itself create additional interference to add to the prevailing environment. The paper describes several case histories that may be considered typical. Techniques of measurement of emitted interference and susceptibility are described, together with various existing standards and limits promulgated for other applications by Government agencies which may be considered for application to the hospital environment and instrumentation. The essentials of a proposed standard specifically designed for this purpose are presented, and in this connection the related work of the American National Standards Institute is discussed. The correlative topic of electrical and radiation hazards in hospitals is also discussed briefly, in relation to the general hospital electromagnetic environment."
"This paper reviews the history of Part 15 which was originally adopted in 1938 and revised in the period 1949-1957. It then shows how in three specific cases the Commission increased the efficiency of use of the spectrum by adopting its Part 15 regulations to permit the operation of RF operated garage door openers, FM wireless microphones, and auditory training systems. Finally, the paper discusses the certification program for devices operating under Part 15."
  "The work described in this paper advances the idea of near-zone safety levels in terms of field strength, power absorbed per unit weight, and power density. The tentative nature of these safety levels derives in part from the lack of validated extrapolation factors from rat to man for non-ionizing radiation."
"The role of RF fields as a new and fundamental ecological factor is discussed. This is justified on the following grounds: 1) the well established interaction of RF radiation with living systems, and 2) the ever growing use of this region of the electromagnetic spectrum that results in a continuous increase in the RF radiation background. A summary of the work conducted in our laboratories on the interaction of RF fields with biological systems is also presented."
"The effects of electromagnetic energy on the human system is reviewed. The interaction between blood and electromagnetic energy is considered as the basic mechanism responsible for unexplained effects to the human system(s). Based upon this consideration, basic magnetohydrodynamic mathematical equations are presented. These equations relate the electric and magnetic field intensities to the velocity, density, pressure and temperature of blood. Equations are also presented relating the change in velocity, density, pressure and temperature of blood when it is exposed to electromagnetic fields."
"If humans cannot perceive even subliminally that they have been immersed in or removed from a 60 Hz. magnetic field of a few gauss strength, comparable with the maximal value to be found around domestic or ELF communication systems, then it becomes very improbable that these fields have deleterious effects. With whole body immersion in a large Helmholtz coil field, some few individuals demonstrate perception scores absolutely impossible by chance, but as they are tested with acoustically quiet sources and with. better and better isolation from auxiliary nonmagnetic clues, fewer and fewer individuals show significant perception and none develop the very high scores found for sensitive subjects in the open coil systems. With an acoustically sealed isolation cabinet now being tested, perception scores may approach negligibility."
"When the electric traction system with 16 2/3 c/s was developed in the twenties, comprehensive research was carried out about the interference problem in the telecommunication circuits. The solution chosen included both special measures in the traction system and change of the telecommunication lines. Since the first locomotives and motor coaches with thyristor control were introduced in 1967, extensive investigations were made about disturbances in signalling and telecommunication circuits. A prototype of static frequency converter to transform the three phase 50 c/s current from the public supply network to single phase 16 2/3 c/s for the traction network was tested in 1971-1972. An important part of the tests consisted in investigations about disturbances from harmonics and measures to reduce these disturbances. The railway telecommunication and signalling circuits are also exposed to induction and earth potentials from power lines and plants, and measures are necessary to provide safety of staff and equipment."
"In this paper, the author would like to outline how today's railroads are getting prepared to meet tomorrow's challenges in achieving electromagnetic compatibility, with both high voltage transmission lines that are paralleling railroad right-of-ways and soon to appear modern main line railroad electrification systems. To do this, the author would like to talk to you both as a member of the AAR Inductive Interference Committee and as a representative of the General Electric Company's Railroad Electrification Team."
  "Design criteria and techniques used to minimize the interference levels between the communication and signal channels for control of rapid transit vehicles and other working systems (such as propulsion, power system, auxiliaries, etc.) or the environment, are analyzed in this paper. The particular system under consideration utilizes a higher frequency band to allow a wide separation from signal to noise, but below 10 KHz and at low power level so that it does not require special license to operate. In addition, the use of Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) and the well known features of signal capture as developed in F.M. Systems are used to further increase the Electro-magnetic Compatibility (EMC) of the overall system. The automatic train control (ATC) engineer must always design his equipment to interface with the outside world, but under some circumstances he may be able to influence the design of other subsystems to meet his particular requirements. For that reason it is extremely important that the ATC and propulsion or power engineers work hand in hand to achieve the electro-magnetic compatibility required in today's systems. An example of such activity is presented to illustrate the extreme importance of designing a transportation system as an integral part of its environment, versus the design of individual subsystems which do not have well defined interfaces. The techniques presented in this paper have been successfully implemented in various transit systems which are presently in operation."
      "This Appendix gives for guidance, examples of suppression arrangements which have been found satisfactory for very many vehicles in a number of countries (see Figure 2, page 21). These devices have not in all cases been verified in other countries. It is not possible to specify precise methods of suppression which will be satisfactory for all types of motor vehicles because features in the design of a vehicle or engine have a great effect on the magnitude of the interference generated or radiated. For example, the level of interference is dependent on the disposition of the ignition components and the lengths of the connecting cables. Such cables should not run close to metallic bodywork in which interference currents may be induced. The cables should, as far as possible, follow paths close to the engine block. In the following, table, vehicles and engines are divided into two groups for the purpose of specifying suppression methods because some assistance in suppression is often given by the metal body of a vehicle and more suppression may be needed where no metal body exists."
       "The susceptibility of cardiac pacemakers to electromagnetic interference has been investigated by physicians and engineers. Questions in a number of areas should be addressed to gain a broader perspective. The clinical significance of interference susceptibility, the responses of pacemakers to interference, and test methods are a few of the more important areas. A panel including a member of the medical profession, and several engineers who have engaged in pacemaker testing will address questions in these areas."

             "To reduce the unaccuracy of interference field measurements of I.S.M. apparatus operating in the GHz-range it has been suggested to take into consideration the method of measurement of the total radiated power from the I.S.M. source. A reverberating box has been set up with suitable provisions to reduce standing waves within acceptable limits. Same theoretical reference considerations and two test procedures have been reported. Statistically assessed test results are being done."
  "This paper considers using the measurements of the Amplitude Probability Distribution, APD, of random impulsive signals generated by vehicle ignition systems. The post detected signal is defined in terms of the Weibull distribution parameters m and k. The prediction of communication degradation effects using the Weibull distribution parameters is also considered."
   "The imposition of the RS01 tests and limits on equipment can pose an extremely severe design problem that is often missed or just plain ignored by systems designers. It is important to define the magnitude of the problem and to spell out potential design impasses at an early point in the design program. This paper presents a method of defining the magnitude of the problem by determining the shielding materials and thickness which would be required for RS01 compliance. These, in turn, can be translated into weight, volume, and usability figures."
"Summary form only given. EMI gaskets and fingerstock are used extensively by the electronic industry to provide bonding and shielding of electromagnetic energy for the purpose of eliminating electromagnetic interference (EMI). The quality of the bond and subsequent shield is usually quite adequate during the initial placement and use; environmental effects such as moisture, heat, vibration, shock and normal maintenance use can, however, have a severe impact on the electromagnetic bond. The effects which moisture, heat, vibration and normal usage have on the contact resistance of two types of fingerstock are evaluated and tabulated."

"It is often possible to modify the acceleration factors of the aging reactions of insulating materials to such an extent that the acceleration factors for different reactions become identical. This can be done by changing the concentrations of active gases like oxygen and water vapor appropriately. It is shown that the same acceleration factor is also valid for the results of the conventional aging test, i. e., for the thermal life of the material."
"A special assembly for accelerated thermal deterioration test of insulators in air was developed and the results on enamelled wires were shown. The results obtained are as follows: 1. It was shown that a new assembly using a gas circulating pump, a platinum filament, and a liquid nitrogen cold trap is very effective for collecting small amounts of gas generated from insulators heated in air. 2. The thermal deterioration of enamelled wires in air can be studied over a wide temperature range from high temperatures to normal working temperatures. The thermal deterioration characteristics of enamelled wires shown by the logarithm of the generation rate of (CO + CO2) versus 1/T is generally made of two offset line segments of differing slopes. The difference of slope would indicate a difference of thermal deterioration mechanism. 3. The slope of log(1/Δp) versus 1/T curve coincides with the slope of log(life) versus 1/T plot obtained in the measurements of the breakdown voltage. 4. According to the above results, the thermal life of enamelled wires in air at normal working temperatures can be estimated using together two type of information: a) the slope of log(1/Δp) versus 1/T, and b) the results of actual life tests made at much higher than normal temperatures. 5. The deterioration of enamelled wires in air will depend on the diffusion of atmospheric oxygen into the enamel films and the oxidation of the film by the diffused oxygen."
"The outstanding points in this test for evaluating the thermal stability of dual coated magnet wire by viscoelastic behavior are as follows: 1. For dual coated magnet wire, it will be possible to estimate the thermal class of undercoated film and overcoated film from the temperature at which the tan δ curve rises before heat aging, and also the ratio of the film thickness from the peak of the tan δ curve. 2. The heat aging process is made clear by the tan δ curves of the tubed films obtained after heat aging. 4. The activation energies versus X as an end point of heat aging are also obtained. The activation energies of heat aging vary according to the material combinations, and as the film thickness of polyamideimide increases, the activation energy also increases."
"It was in January 1970 that a coordinated research program was set up by Shell to investigate the hazards involved in tank washing of VLCC. The work has been undertaken principally at Koninklijke/ Shell Laboratorium, Amsterdam (K. S. L. A.), the Shell Thornton Research Centre and at Southampton University. The purpose of this paper is to give an account of some ignition experiments carried out at Southampton, during which it was demonstrated that propane/air mixtures can be ignited by an unusual mechanism involving circumstances which could be realized during tank washing with high velocity water jets."
"In the early development of polymer systems for use in outdoor HV applications, short time arc-resistance test methods were established to rapidly determine if materials would track or carbonize under wet-arcing. To obtain arcing, a conductive water film was formed on the material surface by introducing artificial polluting and wetting agents. Materials were screened and classified according to their capability to withstand time and/or voltage. Non-tracking polymers were usually classified based on surface and volume erosion. Many of these materials were also evaluated in outdoor functional tests as rods, plates, or model insulators. The performance of these insulator bodies was monitored through periodic inspection of surface condition of the polymers and/or by observation or measurement of electrical surface activity under wet service condition. These tests indicate that the electrical surface phenomena and stability not only vary with time and location but are also dependent on the long term surface properties of polymer systems evaluated."
"Experiments have been devised to study surface and volume noise in typical materials used for organic insulators. These experiments are designed to simulate actual conditions in service. It is hoped that they will furnish a sound basis for accelerated life studies in operating enviornments."
"1. The degree of stability of resistivity with regard to stress and temperature depends upon the chemical formulation of the extruded material."
"It is well known that the addition of conducting particles such as “carbon black” can substantially increase the electrical conductivity of various insulating materials. 1–3 At relatively high carbon loading the conductivity undergoes large increases, presumably when the random packing of the particles leads to infinite conducting chains.4 This report deals with the conduction properties of 3% carbon loaded polyethylene where the basic insulating characteristics of the host material are unaltered, except that uniformly distributed conducting centers may give rise to slightly higher levels of conduction."
"The electrical performance of MIS (Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor) and IGFET (Insulated Gate Field Effect-Transistor) devices potentially depends upon the manufacturing process for the dielectric film and the gate metal electrode. In earlier reports1,2 it was shown that the relative magnitude of the interface states and the mobile ionic charges are mainly responsible for the electrical instabilities which cause the degradation of the devices. It was further shown that these charges could be minimized by post-annealing the dielectric structures in suitable ambients. This study reports the effect of various metallization (or gate electrode) techniques on the SiO2-Si structure. The preliminary investigation indicated that various metallization methods mainly affected the flat band shift after stressing. Therefore, this investigation deals with ionic instabilities caused by different techniques of metallization."
"Polydimethylsiloxanes fluids, by virtue of their inorganic, siloxane backbone rapidly form solid bridges on breakdown which effectively extinguish any arcs. If this solid material is continuously removed from the electrode gap, an arc can be sustained, in which case, the “arc power” and volume of gas evolved per unit time are dependent upon molecular structure, molecular weight, and molecular weight distribution of the fluid. Judicious blending of these controllable variables should lead to a silicone insulating fluid having optimum characteristics."
"The mobility of thermal electrons in a liquid1–12 and the penetration range of low energy (≾10 eV) electrons into a liquid11–18 vary greatly from one liquid to another. These phenomena have received considerable attention in recent years. There is a correlation between the mobilities and ranges in different liquids,12 although it is not well understood. More experimental information is required."
"In general, the flux of electrical charge depends on the number of charge carriers per unit volume and their mobility in an applied field. In amorphous polymeric systems of low dielectric constant, where the charge carriers are presumably ions, the conventional methods of altering the mobility (e. g., changing the temperature or pressure, adding a fluid diluent) usually also change the concentration of the ions. The analysis of the experiment is thus quite difficult unless the alteration can be done in an isodielectric manner. This paper reports such a study."
"It has been shown that the electric field distribution and, consequently, the space charge distribution, in a liqUid insulant are different under direct and low frequency alternating voltage and that both differ from ideal distribution predictable from geometry. It has been recently shown that in commercial insulating liquids the breakdown is controlled by space charge.2 For lack of more substantial information, however, authors7 have obtained the breakdown field strength at 60 Hz in an insulating liqUid by measuring the breakdown voltage and calculating field from the electrode geometry. It is shown here that even with plane parallel electrodes the field can differ markedly from the ideal case because the electric field in a liqUid insulator is defined by both the electrode geometry and by the space charge dynamics within the fluid."
"Although our theoretical model was not able to predict the time dependence of ion current at low dose we did get a reasonable fit to the experimental curve for the high dose case where space charge effects dominate. In order to get better agreement at low dose we are attempting to include the effects of liquid motion in our model."
"A powerful new diagnostic tool employing a Q-switched laser has been developed for the study of very high speed events in dielectrics. In an early experiment, it has been possible for the first time to study in detail cavity formation and growth in n-hexane under uniform field conditions immediately before breakdown. The results show that cavities play a vital initiation role in electrical breakdown, but that they never become very large because of unstable surfaces. This leads to irregular shaped cavities and very high field enhancement in the liquid itself, where impact ionization is likely to occur."
"Induced birefringence, or the electro-optic Kerr effect, has been used by a number of authors to study the steady-state distribution of space charge in a parallel-plate capacitor with nitrobenzene or chlorobenzene.1-9"
"From the experiments on excess electron mobility in liquid methane, ethane and their mixtures. the following picture evolves: in liquid methane the electron moves as a quasi-free particle and the magnitude of the mobility is determined by scattering on methane molecules. In liquid ethane the electron is localized and the transport occurs via jumps from one trap to the next. The traps are preexisting. Increasing the ethane concentration in the binary mixtures reduces the mobility in the quasi-free state and leads to trapping with the trap depth increasing with ethane concentration."
"The authors and their co-workers have been studying the prebreak-down phenomena in pure liquids by using a bubble chamber.1–3 The experiments have been successful in recording the phenomenon which would be considered as an electron emission from the cathode surface. The results suggest that the conduction currents at a field of 106 V/cm near the cathode are predominantly affected by the electrons emitted from the cathode surface."
"In dielectric materials, measurements of the low frequency ac conductivity can often reveal certain features of the electrical conduction mechanism which are often not apparent from the data derived through dc or higher frequency ac measurements alone. In the not too distant past, low frequency measurements were difficult and tedious due to the rudimentary measuring techniques available and the associated instrumentation problems. However, the recent development of a low frequency bridge by Harris1 has changed the situation entirely; now low frequency measurements may be carried out with relative ease in the range from 10−3 to 1 Hz, using the Harris technique."
"From the test results on both the oil in service and the oil obtained by accelerated oxidation, it became clear that in the initial stage of deterioration process tan δ is extremely large in spite of the “good” value of ρ, acid number, and interfacial tension and its magnitude is influenced by air, sunlight, and temperature."
"The electrostatic field at the blade electrode is high enough to allow substantial field emission in vacuo. Current-voltage curves for the liquid alkanes have often been interpreted on the basis of cold-cathode electron injection.1,2,4 However, it is difficult to envisage an electrode process which would explain the symmetrical conduction in the oil and other liquids. This would seem to require a charge-generation process in the fluid itself, such as ionization, corona, or field-assisted dissociation of impurities."
"High immobile charge carriers may be present in dielectrics either as conducting charges in very narrow energy bands or as charges trapped at centers which may arise from chemical or structural defects. In either case, if the mobility is sufficiently low these charges may entirely determine the field strength variation while contributing negligibly to the current by comparison with more mobile species. For definiteness, we consider a model in which low mobility holes are injected into the dielectric via an ohmic contact at the anode, and high mobility electrons are injected by Fowler-Nordheim emission from the cathode. The inequalities for the basic assumption will then read equation and equation where p and n are the hole and electron densities, respectively, and µp and µn are the corresponding mobilities. The direct current characteristics of such a model have recently been calculated,1 and it is the purpose of this paper to calculate the current due to a step function applied voltage. The effect of recombination will also be considered."
"The dielectric breakdown phenomena of various kinds of thin films have been investigated as a result of the development of microelectronics. We have studied the dielectric breakdown of evaporated SiO thin films. The breakdown of specimens thicker than 200 Å have already been reported.1 In the previous experiments, the breakdown strength increased rapidly with decreasing film thickness and increased linearly with increasing work function of cathode metal, and temperature had a little effect on the breakdown strength in the range between −150° and 90°C. Therefore, the breakdown was explained by an avalanche breakdown mechanism in which electron injection from the cathode and field distortion by positive carriers created by electron avalanche were invoked. On the other hand, it was pointed out2 that the breakdown of extremely thin SiO films did not seem to be caused by the avalanche breakdown mechanism, since film thickness and cathode metal had little effect on the breakdown strength. In this paper, the experimental results on the breakdown strength and conduction current for the extremely thin SiO films are shown and these results are discussed in terms of the Zener breakdown model in which tunneling of electrons from the valence to the conduction band is considered."
"The sources of partial discharges in piezoelectric power transducers must be minimized if the corona discharge specifications are to be met. This paper describes some of the results of an investigation into the causes of partial discharges in sonal power transducer elements using a new method of discharge pulse display. The objective of the work was to provide greater insight into the factors leading to corona with the expectation that better methods of quality control in the fabrication of devices might follow."
"This paper presents a study of electrical breakdown effects on LiF cleavage surfaces situated in compressed nitrogen gas. The object of interest is the (100) dendrite. As first reported by Gilman and stauff,1 this dendrite forms extensive surface patterns on the cleavage face of LiF crystals situated in dielectric liquids when subjected to dc positive (dominant pattern) and negative breakdown voltage. Its classification as a dislocation feature was not accepted by workers at NRL2 who found it to be grooved and channeled. However, since dislocation spike structures, known as screw pairs, were found about some dielectric breakdown paths, 3 the question of primacy was not resolved. According to the basic observations and ideas of von Hippel, 4 substantiated by the work of Cooper and Elliott5 and of Davisson, 6 and treated theoretically by Offenbacher and Callen, 7 the dielectric breakdown path is produced by the disruptive action of oriented electron avalanches which results initially in the formation of dislocation-free, plasma-containing, grooves and channels. The orientation is due to the Brillouin zone structure of the normal modes of lattice vibration. Gilman and stauff1 have proposed that dielectric breakdown is preceded by a discontinuous nucleation of dislocation loops."
"In a previous paper1 the authors have described the so-called “empirical” and “semiempirical” methods of estimating minimum breakdown (sparkover) voltages for gas insulated systems. The authors' special interest is with systems insulated with compressed air or SF6 at several bars pressure as might be found in high-voltage gas insulated metalclad switchgear2,3 and associated equipment. The above techniques can be used at the design stage to ensure that the statutory high-voltage test levels, including 50 Hz and lightning impulse, will be attained in practice."
"The preliminary results presented here are an extension of our previous studies into the effect of metallic particle contaminants on the high voltage electrical breakdown in compressed gases.1,2 The earlier work dealt mainly with ac breakdown in SF6 gas in coaxial electrode geometries, under conditions where it was not possible to directly view the gap under voltage. The present study used a new test chamber in which direct observations of particle behavior between plane parallel electrodes at elevated gas pressures were possible."
"The experiments reported here again confirm the critical role of the electrode-insulator junctions in vacuum surface flashover phenomenon. From the experiments reported it is difficult to resolve the relative importance of any bulk space charge as compared to the surface charge. However, it is clear that under opposing dc and impulse stresses the insulator performance could be significantly impaired."
"An insulator placed between parallel electrodes in vacuum obtains a positive charge when the applied field exceeds a threshold value. The charging is due to an electron avalanche, as noted by Boersch et al.,1 de Tourreil and Srivastava,2 Watson,3 and Brainard and Jesen.4 The avalanche involves high gain multiplication of secondary electrons over large areas of the insulator and can reach several amperes in a few nanoseconds. The multiplication on the insulator surface is uncontrolled in that once it has been initiated, it cannot be stoppped until saturation is reached. The saturation, which occurs in less than 50 nsec, is due to positive charge accumulation on the surface which reduces the average path length of the electrons, and therefore the energy extracted from the applied field to a value EI (Figure 1) where the secondary emission coefficient equals unity. It has been suggested2,4 that field emitted electrons originating from the cathode near the insulator surface trigger the avalanche. The most probable source of these electrons is the cathode-vacuum-insulator interface (triple junction), where the field emission is increased due to field enhancement in micron-size vacuum voids between the cathode and insulator.5"
"When a solid insulator in vacuum is subjected to a high-voltage pulse with short rise time, a low-resistance flashover path may be formed in a few nanoseconds across several centimeters of insulator surface.1,2 Although the details of the breakdown mechanism remain obscure, it is generally accepted that field emission of electrons at the cathode-insulator-vacuum junction and insulator surface charging are involved. Experimental measurements of properties of the flashover during its development across the insulator surface, reported here, provide strong evidence that positive surface charging by secondary electron emission (SEE) plays a major role in the formation of the flashover path."
"The authors have noted that a deformation occurs in an artificial void during deterioration life testing. The deformation suggests that there is a pressure change in the void and the pressure change results in a variation in the discharge processes in the void. We have studied this problem with a large artificial void in order to measure the volumetric change of the gases in the Void, to observe the optical characteristics of the discharge, and also to observe the change in the distribution of discharge magnitudes in the void during test. We have also analyzed the void discharge phenomena using an equivalent circuit."
"Recently, as a result of the use of a great variety of polymeric dielectric materials as the insulation for high voltage electric devices, the importance of treeing breakdown has been established. This paper describes some results of a study on tree initiation and growth using the short time supply of voltage and the single needle and direct ground system in polystyrene and polyvinylchloride over the temperature range from 20° to 80°C."
"It is well-known that corona or partial discharges have a deleterious effect on the electrical insulation of many equipments. For example, they limit the life of cable and capacitor dielectrics subjected to power-frequency stresses. Methods for detecting and measuring those discharges in gaseous cavities in solid dielectrics under direct or alternating voltage conditions have been in common use for some years. Many different nondestructive techniques have been developed. Some of them are used to follow insulation aging."
"The needle test in some of its variations has been developed to the point where it provides reliable and reproducible quantitative data on the resistance of materials to dielectric failure due to isolated partial discharge initiated at the tips of very sharp electrodes. However, it is still attacked on the basis that its results are not meaningful. That is, they are not valid in evaluating materials for use in cables because the needle test does not simulate closely enough the conditions which a cable sees in actual use underground, in direct buried applications."
"The actual dielectric breakdown of PE cables or PE sheet specimens often occurs through treeing. Primarily, slight damage to the PE surface accelerates treeing, Significantly reducing dielectric breakdown voltage (Figure 1)."
"A hypothesis is presented which may be stated as follows: “In cables, the inception of electrochemical trees at the site of contaminants, is independent of the nature of the contaminants; it is a consequence of the presence of gaps or weak boundary layers at the contaminant-insulation interface, where liquid can collect; certain liquids, under the influence of electrical stress can induce electrochemical trees.”"
"1. Accelerated life tests conducted in hot water on completed power cables can provide a measure of cables' resistance to the type of treeing which occurs in service."
"The inevitable problem associated with the use of a cryogenic liquid in an insulation system is the bubble formation and subsequent partial discharge in the bubble. The first half of the paper describes the pressure dependence of partial discharge in liquid nitrogen (LN2) and Lichtenberg figures of surface discharges along a color negative film in LN2. The following part deals with the treeing phenomena of low density polyethylene at LN2 temperatures."
"Extruded plastic insulation is expected to have a great advantage as compared with oil impregnated paper insulation in the case of very long HVDC cable lines. But detailed dc characteristics of this type of insulation must be studied before it can find use in practical applications."
"In considering engineering plastics for use as load-bearing materials, it is often necessary that they possess both high tensile properties and impact strength. A perusal of these properties for pure polymers indicates that, with few exceptions, both properties are not found together. Thus, manufacturers, in seeking to obtain both of these desirable properties in the same material, generally blend, graft or fill, using components having one of the desired properties. The resultant composite polymer has a combination of the properties of its components, reduced in magnitude through dilution."
"The ice clathrates or clathrate hydrates, with one or two exceptions, consist of two structurally-distinct kinds of ice built of mutually hydrogen-bonded water molecules in such a way as to enclose voids of more or less spherical shape and large enough to contain guest molecules ranging up to CCl4 in size. They are the subject of an immense literature which goes back at least to Humphrey Davy's 1810 report of a hydrate of chlorine. The clathrate nature of the “gas hydrates” was established about 20 years ago by x-ray studies, principally those of von stackelberg. They differ from other known clathrate systems, inter alia, in the degree of sphericity of the cages and in the variety of encagable molecules. Almost 70 molecular species are known to form stable clathrate hydrates. A general review of the subject to mid-1971 has recently been published.1"
"The dielectric absorption in amorphous solids arises mainly from two mechanisms:1 (1) the conformational rearrangements of the molecular chain, or network, which are relatively slow, and are associated with the glass transition, and, (2) the chain twisting, ion mobility, or a small unit motion of the network, which are relatively fast, and are generally seen in the glassy state below the dilatometric glass transition temperature, Tg. These two relaxation regions are normally termed α- and β-relaxations, respectively."
"In a previous publication, apparatus for determination of the complex dielectric permittivity at centimeter wavelengths was described.1 The geometry used allowed acquisition of a digital record of the power reflected from a short-circuited liquid sample as a function of its length. This experimental procedure is appropriate for samples of moderate to high dielectric loss. For low loss samples, one examines instead the shape of the standing-wave pattern in the transmission line below the termination, liquid lengths corresponding to real terminating impedances being chosen.2-4 This work is concerned with a modification of the geometry and electronics of the high loss instrument to a configuration which allows a digital record of the standing-wave pattern to be obtained automatically. The system makes feasible the accumulation of large amounts of raw data which are used to average out random errors and to characterize systematic departures from the working equations resulting from nonideal instrument geometry."
"The investigation of the dielectric properties is generally performed using either ac or dc voltages. As the ac and dc properties often differ significantly, it is of practical importance to study the properties under simultaneous action of both ac and dc voltages. Little research has been devoted to the study of this problem.1"
"Residual silanol was shown to be the determining factor in the dissipation factor-relative humidity response curve for polydimethyl-siloxanes. In a PDMS gum, 60 ppm metal ion impurities had a minimal effect on the 100 Hz dissipation factor at 50% relative humidity. However, their presence resulted in a two-fold decrease in volume resistivity."
"The dynamic and equilibrium properties of lattice model polymer chains in solution has been simulated using Monte Carlo techniques. This model exhibits similar behavior to the Rouse bead-and-spring model which has been the basis for most molecular model studies of the dynamical behavior of polymer chains.1,2 The lattice model chain is a particularly useful approach as it facilitates the introduction of many specific types of interactions not presently amenable to analytical treatment.3-6"
"Molecularly associated liquids, e. g., alcohols,1 amides,2 etc., have been studied extensively by dielectric methods in the supercooled state. The relaxation features of these liquids have been suggested to arise from the hydrogen-bonded structure in them. Nonassociated liquids, which although are a better model for the understanding of the dielectric behavior, have only recently been shown to supercool readily and have since spurred a considerable interest in their studies.3 We report the main features of the static and the dynamic dielectric behavior of several dialkyl phthalates in the supercooled liquid state. Since these phthalates are also of considerable technical importance in that they are generally used as plasticizers in a variety of polymers, we feel that their dielectric study would also be helpful to polymer scientists who are involved in the use of the commercially available polymers for insulation purposes."
"The molecular behavior of nondipolar fluids is revealed to some extent by the variations in relative permittivity with temperature and pressure. These variations are small, however, and departures from the Clausius-Mossotti equation for a wide variety of gases and liquids at pressures up to 3000 bars is no more than 2% or so of the molar polarizability. Extensive data is now available for the relative permittivity of the n-alkane family from n-pentane to n-decane (Scaife)1 with a precision of O. 1% or better for temperatures ranging from −25°C in some cases and OOC in others, up to 100°C, and at pressures up to 3500 bars."
"Silicone fluids constitute a very diverse family of organosiloxane liquids having the general structure equation in which R may represent almost any organic group. These fluids are coming increasingly in use in dielectric and insulating systems because of their thermal, electrical, and chemical characteristics and particularly as they are becoming economically competitive."
"It has been known for a long time that after application or removal of a field across a metal-dielectric-metal sandwich a current decreasing with time flows in the external circuit. The absorption currents which flow in polymers on application or removal of a field can be attributed to a number of polarization processes such as an orientation of dipoles or trapped space charge. Adamec1 suggested that the absorption current which flows in polyethylene and similar polymeric materials was caused by the formation of a space charge of trapped carriers rather than dipolar rotation."
"Although the mobility in polymers using various methods has been reported by several authors, the values of mobility are not consistent among each other.1,2"
"Many polymers have excellent electrical properties, as well as a variety of physical, chemical, and mechanical properties, that make them very suitable for insulating materials. Since knowledge of the nature of electrical conduction in insulating materials is incomplete, it is sometimes not clear whether the charge transfer process involves the transport of ions or electrons for a certain polymer. However, it would appear that the electrical conduction of polar polymers in a relatively low electric field is ionic. It is, therefore, useful to try to explain some of the complexities of the conduction process in polymers on the basis of behavior of ionic charge carriers. The complexities noticed commonly are the abrupt change in conductivity versus temperature behavior at the glass transition temperature of polymers and the derivation from Arrhenius behavior at temperatures above the glass transition temperature."
"Three interesting features in the σapp vs. 1/T plot were found with the continuous current measurement during the cooling process. The abrupt change of σapp near Tc is thought to be due to the reduction of the number of charge carriers caused by crystallization and the bend behavior of σapp may be associated with the crystalline dispersion. The hump in the region C is induced by the displacement current originating from the dipole orientation. The reason why the curve obtained with Th < Tc has no bend behavior is under consideration at present."
"The results presented in the preceding section indicate several interesting trends. In the case of polyethylenes, one notes that the proportionality between dielectric constant and density relationship is obeyed as long as the molecular weight distributions of the polymer system are of the same modality. The dielectric loss factor appears to reflect the degree of crystallinity in these polymers and is lowest for the most orderly structures, i. e., HDPE. The frequency dependence of the loss factor suggests that these losses are caused by interfacial polarization. This means that boundaries between amorphous and crystalline (spherulite) regions are responsible for the losses. The more crystalline HDPE with larger crystalline regions possess fewer boundaries and thus exhibit somewhat lower losses. The other extreme, XLPE, has few if any orderly regions and thus does not show the same degree of interfacial polarization. In this case the loss is probably due to the movement of those chains which are free to carry out some kind of crank shaft motion. Contributing to these losses will also be the remnants of the cross-linking agent. Another important observation is the effect of antioxidant on the dielectric loss in LDPE where a 10 fold change in concentration causes barely a change in dielectric loss over the frequency spectrum studied."
"When a dielectric material is exposed to ionizing radiation, electron- ion pairs are formed. Most of these charge pairs recombine on a very short time scale. Those that escape this initial (geminate) recombination contribute to the photoconductivity at times accessible to experimental determination. We present results of calculations of the time-dependent neutralization of an isolated electronion pair in a condensed dielectric medium for values of time ranging from very early times, i. e., times short compared with times at which phenomena can be directly observed experimentally, out to the earliest measurable times. The restriction of the theory to isolated electron-ion pairs should apply reasonably well to ionization produced by low LET (linear energy transfer), high-energy radiation. The present work considers the neutralization of isolated electron-ion pairs in a condensed dielectric medium for two cases: (1) no chemical impurities acting as charge scavengers are present; and (2) charge scavengers are present. structural effects, characteristic of the solid state, are neglected. Thus, the model is most applicable to pure dielectric liquids."
"Electron beams with a range smaller than the material thickness have been utilized in the past to permanently charge thin polymer films metalized on one or on both surfaces.1,2 The dynamics of charge injection and the parameters governing the charge decay in such films can be investigated with the method of the “Split-Faraday Cup.”3,4 In particular, it is possible to study the radiation-induced conductivity (RIC), the delayed radiation-induced conductivity (DRIC) observed after termination of the irradiation, and breakdown conditions in the nonirradiated part of the dielectric."
"The mobility of charge can be determined by observing a peak in the conduction current under an applied rectangular voltage pulse. If the charge carrier is injected into bulk from the cathode and reaches the anode giving rise to a current peak, the mobility can be calculated from the theory of transient space charge limited currents.1"
"Liquid-nitrogen impregnated polymer-paper insulated cables are considered to be most promising as cryoresistive cables. The cables have low values of ε tan δ and seem to have dielectric breakdown strengths high enough for UHV cables. Such a type of insulation, however, does not necessarily show sufficient resistance against internal discharges (corona). Since liquid nitrogen is used near its boiling point, it can easily vaporize due to heat generated by heavy current loads or shortage of liquid nitrogen supply. It is anticipated that discharges take place in these vapor bubbles, which could lead to discharges of the liquid phase followed by the breakdown of the whole cable insulation. Internal discharges and their effects on polymer paper and films were investigated in a cavity filled with liquid nitrogen to simulate a butt gap created by winding the polymer paper around the conductor. These results are described in the paper."
"The intent of this paper is to review the electrical insulation concepts which are being considered for resistive cryogenic and superconducting cables and to call attention to our lack of understanding of many of the dielectric phenomena which will influence the design of future low-temperature cables. Since the author is more familiar with wrapped impregnated systems than with the other dielectric systems, this topic will be emphasized."
"The increasing power demand suggests the use of cryogenic cables cooled with liquid nitrogen, liquid hydrogen, and liquid helium for underground transmission lines instead of conventional paper insulated high voltage cables."
"This paper represents a brief excursion into the considerable volume of literature on the electrical properties of cryogenic liquids. Sophisticated theoretical models of charge-motion are available which give fair agreement with experimental results but the situation with regard to breakdown is not so satisfactory. Even allowing for the amount of published work on these liquids the data on the impulse strength is conspicuous by its scarcity."
"The purpose of this work was to provide the designers of cryogenic apparatus with the necessary basic data for the choice of insulation materials, particularly for use at high voltages. In this report, the main results have been gathered in order to initiate a discussion."
"The power transmission line under development at Brookhaven is a superconducting cable consisting of flexible, concentric, coaxial conductors insulated by wrapped dielectric tape. A demonstration model is under design for 69 kV system operation; the goal for the insulation is an operating stress of 250 V/mil."
"Technical and economic considerations indicate that it is advantageous to operate cryogenic underground cables at high voltages in an optimum range between approximately 100 and 500 kV. Several programs under way in the United states for the development of high voltage superconducting or cryoresistive cables were recently summarized by Belanger.1 An appendix to his paper summarizes the most important work in progress in other countries. In particular, the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission has funded a program to investigate several different superconducting cable concepts. The design of these high voltage cryogenic cables will require engineering data on the dielectric behavior of cryogenic liquids and solid insulators similar to that which already exists for room temperature liquid and solid insulation."
"A test length of a liquid nitrogen-cooled, vacuum-insulated coaxial cable for use in underground power transmission has been studied with respect to its high voltage insulation properties. The critical element in the cable is the spacer between the conductors, since electrical discharges in the system are easily initiated across this spacer. Previous experiments with voltage sources capable of supplying low currents indicated insignificant discharge damage to the spacer as long as inorganic materials were used. The new results given in this paper show that insulator damage may still be small for discharges with peak current amplitudes up to 40 kA. The discharge current was supplied by an energy storage capacitor bank for a large number of tests with the same spacer. In addition to current measurements, photographic records of the discharges are presented and an assessment of the damage to the insulator and conductors is given."
"From 14 March through 9 April 1971, the New London Laboratory of the Naval Underwater Systems Center conducted a far-field, extremely-low-frequency (ELF) attenuation-constant measurement test. Two sites located along the same great-circle path were utilized. One site (3.9 Mm) was in St. John Island, Virgin Islands; the other (1.7 Mm) was near Swansboro, North Carolina. The horizontal magnetic-field strengths were measured at a band of frequencies centered at 45 Hz and at 75 Hz to determine the attenuation rates for daytime and nighttime propagation conditions. The EW antenna of the US Navy ELF Wisconsin Test Facility, Clam Lake, Wisconsin, was the transmission source. The principal results obtained from these measurements were that (a) the daytime attenuation rate is higher than the nighttime rate at both 45 and 75 Hz and (b) the ionospheric excitation factors are quite different for daytime and nighttime propagation conditions. A comparison of these results with the data taken previously and concurrently shows excellent agreement."
"Previous studies of range and angular errors caused by variation of atmospheric refractivity with altitude generally have used functional expressions, averaged data, or data from a small number of radiosonde ascents. In this investigation a large data base was employed consisting of radiosonde measurements made at intervals of about 2 hr for a period of 1 week. In the analysis it was assumed that the refractivity varied only as a function of altitude and that there was no ducting. Curves showing the deterioration of range correction with time for selected terminal points were developed by tracing rays at a succession of elevation angles. Thus, for a ground range of 416.7 km and an aircraft at 15.24 km, the standard deviation of the ground-to-plane radio distance 4 hr after a radiosonde ascent is .9 m, increasing to 1.3 m after 8 hr, and 1.6 m after 12 hr."
"The determination of the D-region electron-density profile may be obtained by the solution of an integral equation when the absorption at several frequencies is known. A new method based upon an iterative process is derived and is found to be more reliable than the previous methods."
"Resonance conditions concerning the nonlinear interaction of acoustic gravity waves are considered. It is shown that a resonant trio of waves with nonzero frequencies can be found in situations in which viscous damping has to be taken into account."
"The interaction of an electromagnetic wave with a plane interface between a stationary isotropic medium (dielectric or vacuum) and a homogeneous cold magnetized plasma moving uniformly parallel to the interface is considered for arbitrary angles of incidence. Calculations are presented for the case in which the static magnetic field lies in the interface and is oriented normal to both the plane of incidence and the direction of the streaming motion. It is found that the reflection and the transmission characteristics for an incident E wave are unaffected by the anisotropy and the velocity of the moving medium. Numerical results for the reflection and the transmission coefficients for an obliquely incident H wave have been obtained for several values of the magnetic field and the electron density of the moving plasma half-space. It is found that the moving magnetized plasma medium allows certain stop and pass bands under suitable physical conditions."
"The input admittance or impedance and the effective height of small metal antennas, with a finite gap, located in a dispersive environment, is obtained in an analytical form by properly renormalizing a modal series. The equivalent network of the antenna turns out to be composed of physically realizable elements, thus allowing the computation of the transient response by using Laplace transform techniques. The extension to the case of an inhomogeneous or a uniaxial anisotropic environment is also suggested."
"For tapered circular aperture with illumination of the form [b + (1 — ξ)v]/(b + 1), expressions for the on-axis electric-field intensity, power density, and directivity reduction are developed. Those expressions are presented in terms of the degenerate hypergeometric function. When v is an integer, the use of recurrence relationship permits simple expressions in closed form to be obtained. For special values of v and b, a set of curves is presented. Also, the application of the expressions developed for any other nonuniform illumination involving circular symmetry are briefly presented."
"Small-angle multiple-scattering is considered from randomly spaced cylindrical plasma striations. It is shown that multiple scattering from several underdense plasma clouds can cause considerable backscatter even though a single undense cloud is capable only of deflecting the ray through fairly small angles. In a case in which the deflection angles are small and many deflections occur before a ray passes through the scattering region, the ray density can be shown to satisfy a Fokker-Planck transport equation. A diffusion coefficient is obtained for this equation for the case of cylindrical Gaussian striations by means of a numerical raytracing program. The transport equation is solved by a finite-difference method to obtain scattering patterns and waveform distortion. The methods of solving the transport equation can be applied to the scattering of radio waves, laser pulses, and other radiation propagating in random media."
"The properties of an insulated dipole antenna are derived when the wavenumber of the surrounding infinite, homogeneous, and isotropic medium is large compared with that of the insulation. It is shown that even when the surrounding medium is a perfect dielectric, the distributions of current and charge along the antenna and its driving-point admittance are substantially like those of a section of transmission line with a distributed radiation loss appearing as a part of the series impedance per unit length."
"The performance of a bare antenna as a radiator in a dissipative medium can be significantly altered by placing a dielectric coating around the antenna. For certain antenna types and specific properties of the dissipative medium, the dielectric insulation has been shown to improve the performance of the antenna. In this paper the thin-wire circular-loop antenna centered in an insulating spherical cavity and immersed in an infinite homogeneous isotropic dissipative medium is analyzed. A Fourier series solution for the antenna current distribution is derived. The coefficients of the series are a combination of the coefficients for the loop in an infinite dielectric medium, which were determined previously by Wu [1962], and a second term, which is an infinite sum. The properties of the sum are examined, and expressions for the antenna input admittance, impedance, and electromagnetic field in the dissipative medium are obtained. Numerical results are presented for specific antenna sizes and dissipative media. For the special case of a loop with a uniform current distribution in an electrically small sphere the expression for the input impedance is shown to reduce to a solution previously given by Wait and Spies [1964]. The construction of an experimental model for the antenna is discussed, and antenna input impedances and current distributions measured with the model immersed in various salt-water solutions are compared with theoretical calculations."
"A solid state microwave refractometer was mounted in a Royal Australian Air Force Dakota aircraft in order to measure vertical profiles of the atmospheric radio-refractive index over the Timor Sea at times of anomalous radio wave propagation. Computer raytracing techniques, applied to model atmospheres based on these measurements, have indicated the importance of tilted layers in the tropospheric ducting of short-wave radio energy."
"A temporary phase recovery observed on long-distance VLF propagation paths at sunrise is shown to be associated with cosmic-ray ionization. Simultaneous measurements of the phase carried out at Atibaia, São Paulo, and Jaguarão, Rio Grande de Sul, appear to demonstrate a latitudinal effect in this phenomenon."
"Using a formulation based on Hamilton's ray equations, the variations of the path of a ray, and of the corresponding phase path, due to changes in the ray end points or the medium properties, are investigated. General expressions are obtained which represent the variations in terms of the solution of systems of ordinary differential equations. These may be integrated along the unvaried rays in order to evaluate the variations. The results, which may be applied to the analysis of a number of propagation problems, represent a simplification for anisotropic media and are also particularly well adapted to numerical applications."
"The frequency spectrum of a CW HF radio signal transmitted from an aircraft and propagated over a 1-hop path inside the polar cap was recorded for about 50 nighttime hr during August 1967. Two different general types of disturbance were observed in these records; (a) a diffuse spectral broadening which was always present to some extent, even under quiet conditions, but which on some occasions was increased by as much as a factor of 2; and (b) discrete frequency anomalies, which were recorded at a rate of about two per hour, and which generally appeared above the carrier frequency (about 9 MHz) and decreased in frequency with a median slope of —2.2 Hz min−1. These discrete anomalies can be interpreted most satisfactorily in terms of Doppler-shifted reflections from moving ionospheric irregularities. On the basis of this interpretation, the observations are taken to show that irregularity velocities are often in the range from 0.5 to 1.0 km sec−1, with a preferred direction of motion roughly toward the quadrant from geographic E to S and centered on geomagnetic E. However, the measurements were relatively insensitive to geomagnetic N-S movements and to low velocities."
"The differential cross sections for an ellipsoid and elliptic cylinders having Gaussian electron-density distributions have been obtained by a ray-tracing procedure. Calculations for the case of an external magnetic field were restricted to the ellipsoidal distribution. The results show that the scattering is extremely sensitive to the orientation of the body. A peak in cross section occurs at the scattering angle corresponding to the ray normal to the critical surface, and increases as the surface becomes flatter. The cross section is sensitive to the ratio of peak density to critical density for moderate values but becomes relatively insensitive when the ratio exceeds 3. The total cross section (shown only for the elliptic cylinder) is a very sensitive function of both orientation and ratio of major to minor axes. The introduction of a magnetic field decreases the ordinary ray cross section; the extraordinary ray exhibits higher cross-sectional values than the nonmagnetic field case. Comparison of the Gaussian ellipsoid with the corresponding conducting ellipsoid shows that the Gaussian has a larger cross section in the forward region but considerably lower values in the backscatter region."
"A study is made of the physics of radiation into the guide between the earth and the ionosphere from a center-fed antenna consisting of a long horizontal wire grounded at its two ends. The length of the wire and the height h of the ionosphere are short compared with the free-space wavelength λ0. The antenna wire, together with its return path through the ground, constitutes the primary circuit of a transformer of which the ionosphere above the antenna to a distance of the order of λ0/2π is a part of the secondary circuit This portion of the ionosphere, together with the corresponding portion of the ground, constitutes the secondary circuit of the transformer. This circuit applies voltage between the rest of the ionosphere and the rest of the ground, thereby launching a wave that propagates between the earth and the ionosphere towards the antipode. The coefficients of mutual and self-impedance for the transformer are calculated and are used to relate the voltage at the terminals of the antenna to the wave that leaves the transformer for the antipode. The transformer action increases the radiated power by a factor of λ0/4h above that for the same antenna in the absence of the ionosphere."
"This paper describes the hydrogen-line interferometer system at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. The system consists of telescopes, receivers, a data acquisition program, and a reduction program. The reduction program uses a random-access data base which stores both the interferometer data and the synthesized maps. The calibration, mapping, and display of the data are described in detail"
"Various digital techniques for estimating the autocorrelation function of a signal are analyzed, with emphasis on methods applicable to radio-astronomy and incoherent-scatter studies of the ionosphere. The importance of coarse (one- or two-bit) quantization is stressed, as is the effect of oversampling, the use of a sampling interval less than the inverse of twice the signal bandwidth. For applications such as incoherent scatter in which the signal strength varies with range (i.e., time), multibit by one-bit multiplication combined with oversampling is probably the optimum strategy, although it requires 32% more integration time than the full multibit by multibit technique. For very high speed sampling of a signal of which the mean amplitude is constant, a three-level by three-level technique offers many advantages. It is nearly as simple to implement as conventional one-bit correlation but requires considerably less integration time to achieve equal statistical accuracy (only 26% more than full multibit correlation, when sampled at twice the Nyquist rate, as compared to 146% for a one-bit correlator with sampling at only the Nyquist rate)."
"The Rayleigh hypothesis is reviewed in relation to scattering by periodic surfaces, aperiodic surfaces, and bounded, two-dimensional bodies. Conditions for its validity are described, and explicit results are quoted for a sinusoidal grating. Some methods to solve scattering problems for periodic surfaces are outlined. One particular procedure for periodic surfaces and bounded scatterers is examined in detail. This involves an expansion for the scattered field in terms of the same sets of elementary wavefunctions that occur in connection with the Rayleigh hypothesis. The coefficients are determined by satisfying the boundary condition in the least-squares sense. It is shown that this solution converges uniformly to the scattered field at all points exterior to the boundary of the scatterer. Necessary completeness properties of the sets of wavefunctions are established in the appendices."
"The integral equation of Hallen's type is derived in the time domain. The solution of the integral equation is carried out numerically, and the electromagnetic behavior of linear antennas and scatterers under various excitations is presented. The integral equation may be used to obtain time-domain responses of coupled parallel linear antennas, and scatterers with loads. Combining with the method of characteristics in solving transmission line problems, the integral-equation formulation is applied to the cases in which antennas and scatterers are connected to transmission lines."
"A previous analysis for a line source on a homogeneous half-space model of the earth is extended to allow for the presence of stratification. The formal integral solution is reduced to a form suitable for numerical integration. Also, a number of special cases and limiting forms are considered. It is shown that the subsurface field has a structure that can be significantly modified when the half-space is no longer homogeneous. The results have application to the design of electromagnetic techniques in mine rescue operations."
"Recursion relations satisfied by the coefficients in certain asymptotic expansions of monochromatic wavefields are pointed out and discussed. One of the relations provides a simple means for obtaining higher-order coefficients from a knowledge of the coefficient of the first-order term, and it yields expressions for the coefficients in a very simple form. The utility of that relation is demonstrated by applying it in Sommerfeld's problem of the radiation of an electromagnetic dipole in the presence of a dissipative half-space."
"The effect of a spherical inhomogeneity on the surface fields of a buried magnetic dipole source is determined from the reradiated fields of induced electric and magnetic dipole moments. For small spheres where the theory is valid, the errors introduced in source location are shown to be small. The results have possible application to rescue operations following coal mine disasters."
"The theories to be considered in this review deal mostly with the effect of random media on the propagation of electromagnetic or other waves traversing them. The purpose aimed at thus consists of finding connections between the statistical properties of these waves and the given statistical properties of the medium itself. The characteristics of this medium are to be fixed by one or more wave equations or by equivalent dispersion relations. The waves may be investigated as such, considering the wave function ѱ(r, t) of one or more associated scalar or vector components, or, more generally, the theory may refer to related quantities, e.g., the squared modulus |ѱ|2 which fixes an energy density or, as in quantum mechanics, a probability density."
"Formulas for the excitation of the earth-ionosphere waveguide by electric and magnetic point dipoles at satellite heights are developed along the lines of Budden's [1961,1962] general theory. The formulation, based on horizontal stratification, allows in an approximate manner for a vertically inhomogeneous, anisotropic ionosphere as well as for earth curvature along the direction of propagation. Although emphasis is on theory, some results pertinent to ELF are given. In particular, numerical comparisons with reciprocity predictions are included."
"This paper explores the application of a previously developed ray-optical theory for scattering by discontinuities in weakly inhomogeneous parallel-plane waveguides or ducts. Emphasis is placed on peculiarities that distinguish scattering calculations in inhomogeneous mediums from those in homogeneous mediums. Attention is given to the role of edge-diffraction singularities in the computation of modal reflection and transmission coefficients, to the relation between ray-optical and Kirchhoff diffraction solutions, to modifications of the ray method in regions of strong variation of refractive index, and to the sensitivity of ray-optical results to the choice of certain generating functions employed in the theory. Numerical computations for guides with linear profiles, inverse-square profiles, and related homogeneously filled circular-waveguide configurations illustrate details of these considerations and permit comparisons with results obtained eslewhere."
"The possibility of focusing a laser beam by the optical inhomogeneities induced by a second strong coaxial laser beam has been investigated. In a particular case in which the power of the strong beam equals the critical power, the medium provides an oscillatory waveguide for the weak beam. When both beams are strong the nonlinearities induced by them are additive, and both beams become focused even when their powers are below the critical powers."
"The papers contained herein are brief summaries of the technical science sessions which were held during the XVII General Assembly of the International Union of Radio Science (URSI) at Warsaw, Poland, in August 1972. They are not in themselves scientific papers. Their purpose is to inform the scientific community of the subjects presented and the names of the scientists reporting on these subjects. It is very important that the information presented be made available because attendance at URSI General Assemblies is more limited than at other scientific meetings."
"K. Evenson (USA) delivered the paper, ‘Stabilized laser-frequency measurements: Methane-stabilized HeNe 3.39 μm and CO2-stabilized 9.3 and 10.2 μm.’"
"2.1.1 IUCRM colloquium. The June 1972 Inter-Union Commission on Radio Meteorology (IUCRM) colloquium, ‘Waves and turbulence and their interaction with EM waves,’ was reported by B. R. Bean (USA). The IUCRM is concerned with interdisciplinary problems related to the effects of the nonionized atmosphere on the propagation of electromagnetic waves and the use of remote-probing techniques to study the atmosphere. Of particular interest to atmospheric scientists and fluid dynamicists on the one hand and to radio scientists on the other is the fine-scale structure of stratified layers marked by strongly sheared flow. Such stratums are the seat of both stable gravity waves and unstable Kelvin-Helmholtz waves; the breaking of the latter is responsible for clear-air turbulence, among other things. The resulting refractively turbulent stratum is also responsible for the scatter of EM waves in tropospheric propagation and for backscatter in the case of microwave or acoustic radars. Recent studies with high-resolution radars have cast new light on the mechanisms of waves and turbulence in hydrostatically stable layers, while fluid dynamicists have advanced this knowledge through theoretical and experimental research on the stability of such flows. Simultaneously, meteorologists have been making strides on the structure and prediction of clear-air turbulence."
"This session was chiefly concerned with the chemical and dynamical factors that are now known to control the distribution of electrons in the D region. The current status of knowledge of the electron-density profile in the D region was reviewed by G. C. Reid (USA), with emphasis on the diurnal and seasonal variations and on the rapid changes that occur during sunrise. With regard to the overall electron ‘budget’ of the region, it was pointed out that important discrepancies between theory and observation still remain and that we are not yet certain whether these result from imperfect knowledge of production rates or of loss mechanisms, or from a combination of both."
"R. M. Thorne (USA) delivered the paper, ‘The need for measurements of plasma density in the outer magnetosphere.’ Inside the magnetopause one of the most important parameters to be measured is the flow of the plasma. These flows result from the electric fields that exist there. Measurement of the low-density thermal [E ≤ 1 kev) plasma can help provide the needed information about the plasma flow and, hence, the electric fields. The importance of the cold plasma is vividly displayed by the correlation of the location and presence of stable-auroral-red arcs with the location of the plasmapause. OGO-5 data was used to show this correlation. The plasma-sphere and plasmatrough are filled from the ionosphere during the daylight hours. Measurements of low-density plasma are needed to study the details of the filling mechanisms."
"This session was limited to observations at wavelengths above 1 cm. The review by B. M. Zuckerman (USA) began with spectral-line equipment developments. Front ends can now be built anywhere in the range 1 to 30 GHz with system temperatures around 20 to 60 K, but these low-noise receivers are all rather inflexible in frequency. There is now widespread use of correlators as back ends, and further improvements in performance can be expected."
"In the paper, ‘Active antenna arrays, 1,’ I. B. Bott (UK) described the various forms of phased arrays that could be made and highlighted problems associated with active arrays. Particular reference was made to the active modules, dealing with their construction and with the assembly of such modules to make a satisfactory antenna."

"The review paper, given by E. L. Maxwell (USA), concentrated on recent developments in three areas: (a) prediction of atmospheric noise levels and characteristics, (b) calculation of system performance in the presence of atmospheric noise, and (c) measurement of atmospheric noise."
"The properties of microwave rotational spectroscopy that make it a promising technique for gaseous pollutant monitoring are presented. Recent advances in instrumentation and technique that have suggested feasibility of in-situ monitoring are thoroughly discussed. A laboratory model of a potentially portable Gunn-diode cavity spectrometer has been interfaced to the atmosphere by way of a multistaged membrane separator. Results of testing this system under controlled experimental conditions as a specific monitor for two common gaseous pollutants are given. Determinations of the optimum sensitivity, specificity, and stability expected for this system are dsciussed along wih considerations for its calibration."
"A method for extracting surface-slope frequency distributions from bistatic-radar data has been developed and applied to the lunar surface. Telemetry transmissions from orbiting Apollo spacecraft were received on the earth after reflection from the lunar surface. The echo-frequency spectrum was related analytically to the probability distribution of lunar slopes. Standard regression techniques were used to solve the inverse problem of finding slope distributions from observed echo-frequency spectra. Data taken simultaneously at two wavelengths, 13 and 116 cm, have yielded diverse slope statistics. In the lunar highlands, results obtained at the two wavelengths either can be quite similar in form and scale or can indicate markedly differing functions. Within the mare, the distributions obtained at the two wavelengths are quite similar in form, but the rms slopes from the 116-cm data are systematically less than those obtained from the 13-cm data. Within the highlands the rms slopes obtained at the two wavelengths are nearly the same."
"Theoretical expressions for the spectral density of amplitude, amplitude-difference, and phase-difference fluctuations of waves propagating over a line-of-sight path in a weakly scattering turbulent medium are derived. Experimental observations made at radio (35 GHz) and acoustic (3 kHz) frequencies are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions under a variety of meteorological conditions. Comparison of experimental and theoretical spectra yields a measure of the average across-the-path wind velocity and the average refractive-index structure constant Cn. In general, wind speeds and refractive-index structure constants inferred from simultaneous meteorological measurements agree with those obtained from propagation data."
"A ray-tracing technique for simulating the performance of the mode-averaging diversity combiner (MADC) [Villard et al., 1972] is described, which extends the methods developed by Croft [1969] to the analysis of frequency-selective fading. It is shown that the computer procedure satisfactorily predicts observations made during a test representative of conditions encountered in practice. Using the parameters of this test, the method is applied to the original MADC configuration to investigate the dependence of performance on antenna spacing and ionospheric profile. Two MADC schemes which incorporate alternative methods of forming the running average are described. Their performance is also evaluated for the above parameters and shown to be roughly equal to that of the original. It is concluded that for the given parameters at least, a choice between the three alternative configurations can be made on the basis of convenience."
"An empirical approach to modeling the electron-density irregularities in the F layer that are primarily responsible for amplitude scintillation of VHF/UHF signals has been devised and tested. An irregularity model was postulated as a function of geomagnetic latitude, local time of day, season, and sunspot number. The primary parameters of the irregularities that were postulated were their strength and transverse scale-size. The irregularities were assumed to be aligned along the geomagnetic field, and their axial ratio was taken as constant, as were the height and thickness of the irregular layer. The model was tested by computing the fractional rms fluctuation in received power to be expected in a given situation, under the weak-scatter assumption, and comparing the results against values of this or related quantities reported in the literature. The model then was improved by iteration. The development made use of 12 data sets, and final testing employed those 12 plus an independent one. Lack of appropriate data precluded testing poleward of about 70° geomagnetic latitude. The model is offered as a tool for VHF/UHF communication-systems planning, to the extent that the average value of scintillation in a specified circumstance is of engineering value. Geophysical application should be limited to such uses as experiment planning, guiding of intuition, and serving as a basis for more refined modeling."
"In this paper a general characterization of the statistics for an ionospherically diffracted, monochromatic plane wave is presented. The main results are restricted to weak scatter, although two possible extensions that accommodate large phase perturbations and multiple scatter are discussed. A detailed discussion of the first-order statistics of amplitude is given. The general Gaussian distribution is discussed together with its Nakagami-distribution approximation and the log-normal distribution. By using a segment of ATS-3 satellite data recorded at Lima, Peru, we show equally good fits to Gaussian and log-normal distributions at least for the limited dynamic range available. The Nakagami distribution provides only a poor approximation. A transverse scale size of 600 m is inferred, which we believe is representative of the nearly linear dependence of the measured field's correlation distance on the Fresnel-zone radius."
"A continuous series of oblique backscatter observations at 19 MHz made at Plum Island, Massachusetts (56°N invariant), over nearly half a solar cycle is utilized to derive the occurrence characteristics of aspect-sensitive field-aligned irregularities in the E-layer and their association with ground-barkscattered echoes which are propagated via sporadic E (E8) reflection. Under quiet magnetic conditions, it is found that the field-aligned echo from E-layer heights, FAE(E), displays a summer evening maximum in conjunction with the E8 echo. A weak secondary maximum is observed in the winter with no detectable field-aligned structures being evident in the daytime E8. During disturbed magnetic conditions, the E8 ground-back-scattered echo is greatly suppressed together with a simultaneous increase of the FAE(E) which also appear in the daytime; no seasonal control is evident. One year's continuous observations at 49 MHz with a narrowbeam antenna showed the quiet time, E8-associated FAE(E) to be of the discrete type, whereas the FAE(E) obtained during storms were found to be diffuse in nature. These observations are discussed from the point of view of current-plasma instability theories."
"Certain errors in the second-order contributions to the scattered field derived in an earlier study are pointed out, and the corrected formulas are presented. The results are compared with experimental data, and an explanation is suggested for the remaining small discrepancies."
"The fundamental transmitting characteristics of an imperfectly conducting circular-loop antenna are investigated theoretically. To obtain the antenna-current distribution, a mathematically simpler method based on a differential equation for the loop current is first developed. Next, an existing, more general method based on an integral equation for the distribution of current is applied with modification and solved numerically with a digital computer. Knowing the current distribution, one can easily find the driving-point impedance. The results of both methods are compared for the case of uniform resistive loading, and they are found to be in good agreement. Some additional numerical examples showing the effect of nonuniform reactive loading on the driving-point impedance are also included. The outcome of this research should provide useful information for the design of broadband circular-loop antennas."

"Three tropospheric scatter systems, featuring antenna-beam angular discrimination, or a combination of both antenna-beam angular discrimination and signal-delay temporal discrimination, are compared for sensitivity and spatial resolution as determined by theoretical calculations. Two of the radars used are bistatic; the third is monostatic or quasi-monostatic. Whenever practical, parameters are chosen equal for all three radars. The linear dimensions of the scatter volume and its size as a function of position in space are determined. The imaging properties of each radar are analyzed after the scatter integral (received power level) is numerically evaluated using a tropospheric multiple-layer model of turbulent refractive-index structure. Results are presented for a 500-km baselength in the bistatic case. Double layers of 100-m vertical width and 500-m vertical separation are displayed as seen with the angular beam resolution of 0.15° (between 3-db points) and 40-nsec temporal resolution corresponding to a 25-MHz system bandwidth."
"The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effects of small-scale turbulence on radio waves propagating through a planetary atmosphere. The analysis provides a technique for inferring the turbulence characteristics of a planetary atmosphere from the radio signals received from a spacecraft as it is occulted by the planet. The planetary turbulence is assumed to be localized and smoothly varying with the structure constant varying exponentially with altitude. Rytov's method is used to derive the variance of log-amplitude and phase fluctuations of a wave propagating through the atmosphere. When the distance between the spacecraft and the planetary atmosphere exceeds L02/λ, where L0 is the outer scale of turbulence, the effects of inhomogeneity and finite size of the turbulent medium become important. A recent study by Gurvich [1969] pointed out that the structure constant for the Venusian atmosphere inferred from the Mariner-5 occultation data was significantly lower than that inferred from the Venera-4 data. By applying the analysis developed in this paper it is shown that the effects of inhomogeneity and finite size of the turbulence, which were excluded in Gurvich's analysis, account for this difference. More important, however, is the fact that the new techniques are available for use in future radio-occultation missions."
"The Mariner-6 and −7 occultation experiments provide sets of Doppler residuals from which physical properties of the Martian atmosphere, such as the ionospheric electron-density distribution and the lower-atmosphere temperature profile, may be derived. The Doppler residuals contain both systematic and random errors. The former are removed during the data reduction, and the latter are analyzed to yield error limits on the derived physical properties of the atmosphere."
"Daily variations of spectral atmospherics parameters, as measured by the atmospheric analyzer of the Heinrich Hertz Institut in Berlin-Charlottenburg, are analyzed over an eight-day period for long lasting storm centers within the octant NE-E (receiving station Stockert near Bonn). The delay-time difference and the amplitude ratio of spectral groups at 6 and 8 kHz were measured alternatively every 5 min. Within the first-mode approximation these parameters are proportional to the propagation distance. Storm centers located by these parameter measurements are compared with synoptical observations. As theory indicates, the strong directional dependence of the GDD (group delay-time difference) and the SAR (spectral amplitude ratio) on the propagation direction relative to the earth's magnetic field is verified by these measurements."
"The use of compressed pulses, in particular binary phase-coded pulses, in incoherent-scatter observations is investigated quantitatively. Since pulse compression requires coherent integration, the compression will be degraded by the time variations in the scattering medium. The degradation is small and easily corrected for as long as the total duration of the pulse (before compression) is less than Tx, the time delay at which the autocorrelation function of the scattering process first becomes negative. For longer pulses the distortions become more serious. With compressed pulses it is a relatively simple matter to achieve a range resolution of less than 1 km in incoherent-scatter measurements."
"The sensitivity of refractive effects to profile shape in the propagation of high-frequency radio waves through the ionosphere is examined for a planar isotropic trapezoidal model of the electron-density variation with height. For a family of trapezoidal profiles with constant peak density, fixed orientation relative to a straight-line path from source to receiver, and constant integrated density along this path, the dependence of the group delay upon profile shape is found to involve only the ratio of the thickness of the peak-density segment of the profile to that of the total profile. For thin profiles, the theory suggests an insensitivity of the group delay to the profile shape for frequencies near the peak plasma frequency divided by the cosine of the zenith angle of the straight-line path, as well as in the familiar high-frequency limit. Expressions for the group delay are also given for parabolic and more general linearly segmented profile models."
"A self-consistent analysis of a radio-frequency impedance of a negatively biased spherical probe in a warm, isotropic plasma is given. Linearized zero- and first-order hydrodynamic and Maxwell equations are numerically solved for a specified probe-retarding potential, and the influence of a realistic sheath structure upon the resonance behavior is discussed. It is concluded that file usual abrupt-sheath model can safely be a good approximation for the study of radio frequency properties of a probe immersed in a plasma."
"The problem of a buried axial Hertzian dipole placed at the end of a semi-infinitely long metallic tube is associated with the investigation of electromagnetic through-the-earth propagation. Under a thin-tube approximation explicit analytic expression of the far-held is obtained by employing the Wiener-Hopf technique. Numerical results are presented in this paper for various dipole locations and ground conductivities. The improvement over the result based upon a Kirchhoff's approximation is noted."
"The radiation from a vertical electric dipole located in the upper anisotropic layer of a stratified conductive earth is analysed in detail. The variations of the near fields in the anisotropic medium and outside zone have an appreciable dependence on the anisotropy factor in the neighbourhood of the dipole. However, the amplitude gradients (with respect to the numerical distance) remain almost uniform for varying coefficients of anisotropy and for the conductivity contrast between the isotropic lower half-space and the longitudinal conductivity of the upper anisotropic conducting layer. The results have applications in underground communications and submarine detection."
"Refraction effects cause radio waves travelling through the atmosphere to be bent. Without knowledge of the atmospheric parameters along the ray path, the degree of bending cannot be calculated deterministically. Since atmospheric emission at microwave wavelengths is dependent on temperature, pressure, and relative humidity, radiometric data contain information about these parameters. This study will make use of a Monte Carlo simulation of the atmosphere to demonstrate that atmospheric emission measurements can be used with surface refractivity to increase greatly the accuracy with which refractive bending can be estimated."
"Based on waveguide mode theory and a simple model to calculate the ionospheric reflection coefficient, electron density profiles are deduced from VLF data. A simplified day/night transition model is described. It is appropriate for explaining the mode conversion during sunset and sunrise and leads to conclusions concerning the change of the electron density profile within the transition region."
"A series of expressions to calculate the monthly median F1 layer penetration frequency (foF1) as a function of the ionospheric index IF2 was reported by DuCharme et al„ [1971]. Using similar techniques and the same data base, development of a series of expressions to calculate foF1 as a function of the Zurich smoothed sunspot number R12 is described. The derived expressions are evaluated for the period of maximum solar activity 1967 through 1969 and compared with observed foF1 data for this period, which are outside the 1954 through 1966 data base used to develop the expressions."
"The optimum signal processing to follow a given radiometer front-end is derived when it is desired to estimate, with smallest rms error, the temperature of a radio source. We find, for the important special case of small sources, that the optimum radiometer is implemented by the use of a compensating filter followed by square-law detection and integration. We consider two examples of receiver front-end gain characteristics, the Lorentzian and Gaussian shapes. Improvement over conventional radiometer performance is shown to be possible."
"A log-periodic array, three km in length, is operating at Clark Lake Radio Observatory. It makes one-dimensional sweeps of the solar brightness distribution in the frequency range 20 to 65 MHz once per sec. The phasing of the array and the receiving system are described, as well as how the dynamic spectra are analyzed for the positions of solar radio sources. Simultaneous measurements at many frequencies enable the observer to remove the effects of ionospheric refraction and to obtain fundamental positions to an accuracy of about one arc min at decametric wavelengths. Fundamental positions are given for Cassiopeia A."
"It is shown that in the above paper [Kostelnicek and Mittra, 1971] and also in previous work [Mittra and Bates, 1967], the solutions do not satisfy the edge condition due to an error in the asymptotic expansion of the infinite product employed in the solutions."
"HF radar signatures have been synthesized from a time-dependent Gaussian ion cloud using a three-dimensional ray-tracing program that can take into account both electron collisions and the earth's magnetic field. The ion cloud model is based on the theory of ambipolar diffusion and the model parameters are based upon the observations made during a barium cloud test conducted at White Sands, New Mexico. Ray-tracing results have been generated for both ordinary (O) and extraordinary (X) modes as well as for the “no-field” case. The results, presented in the form of a time-history of the Doppler shift and the scattering cross section, are found to be quite similar for all three cases. Relative to the O mode, the X-mode variations lag in time and obtain a maximum cross section which is greater only by about 2 db. The variations for the no-field case fall in between that of the O and X, but closer to the O mode. The results show that the cloud is extremely defocussing with an estimated defocussing factor (relative to free space) for the X mode increasing from 7.6 × 103 to 1.85 × 107 over the interval −5 to 190 sec of cloud's life. The ray-tracing signatures are compared to those synthesized by means of a hard expanding ellipsoid method with a view to evaluating the importance of underlying ionization. The effects are found to be such as to introduce a significant time lag in Doppler history and to cause a cross section reduction by a factor that builds up with time from 5 db to more than 30 db. A comparison drawn between the observed and the ray-tracing signatures leads to the conclusion that good agreement between the two can be expected only when the clouds experience either slow or no deformation and striation but not otherwise."
"In this paper the H-integral equation is investigated for the problem of plane-wave diffraction by a thin plate. It is found that the limiting form of the H-equation by itself is not complete unless the condition $\\hat{n}$ • H = 0 is simultaneously enforced. By suitably combining the above-mentioned equations, a new set of equations is derived for the two components of the surface current distribution on the plate. Several advantageous features of the new equations are pointed out, and numerical results based upon the use of these equations are presented for the thin-strip and the square-plate problems."
"The characteristics of electromagnetic surface waves supported by a plane interface separating a semi-infinite region of free space from another semi-infinite region consisting of a double stream of plasma streaming parallel to the interface are investigated for the case in which the wave is progressing either in or opposite to the direction of the stream. The behavior of the surface wave is quite different from the case in which the plasma is stationary. For the case of waves progressing opposite to the direction of the streams, there are backward-wave regions as well as regions of instability which occur below the plasma frequency. In the frequency range of instability, the surface wave undergoes traveling-wave amplification in the direction of the streams. The wave amplification characteristics are examined and the dependence of each on the relative number density of the two streams as well as on the drift velocity is studied. It is found that the maximum amplification rate increases as the drift velocity is increased."
"The reflection coefficients at normal incidence are found for a large class of one-dimensionally inhomogeneous or stratified half-spaces, which contain a homogeneous half-space. The formulation of the problem involves a combination of the classical boundary value technique, and the nonclassical principle of invariant imbedding. Solutions are in closed form and expressible in terms of Bessel functions. All results are given in terms of the ratio of the distance between free space and the homogeneous half-space to the wavelength in vacuo. One special case is that of an arbitrary number of layers lying on a homogeneous half-space where the dielectric constant of each layer has a constant gradient. A number of other special cases, limiting cases, and generalizations are developed including one in which the thickness of the top layer obeys a probability distribution, and another formulation that is computationally efficient in which there is an extremely small change in the dielectric constant such as with atmospheric inversion layers."
"The technique called “modulated pulse” (the emission of HF pulses of suitable length modulated with high or low audiofrequencies) allows an exhaustive study of the propagation of modulated radio waves in the ionosphere. Using this system it is possible to establish that the diminution or the gain, in regard to that emitted by the transmitting antenna, of the percentage of modulation of the received modulated waves is not due in any way, as some researchers have declared, to the interference in the receiving antenna of rays that have travelled different paths in the ionosphere or to multiple echoes, but should be attributed to other reasons."
"The relations between electron content, scintillation, and radio absorption are studied at an auroral zone station. It is found that during absorption events, indicating particle precipitation, the level of scintillation increases and the electron content increases in winter but is unchanged or slightly decreased in summer. At a given level of scintillation, the absorption is greater on a winter day than on a summer day. Although some of the observations are consistent with the results of other investigations, full explanations are lacking. It seems clear that, in addition to direct ionization production by auroral particles, other mechanisms must be involved. Further studies based on reception of geostationary satellite transmissions are recommended."
"Ionospheric refraction is one of the factors limiting the accuracy of radar systems tracking objects in or beyond the ionosphere. In advanced systems it may be desirable to perform accurate corrections for these effects in real time, and because of the extreme variability of the ionosphere, this presupposes real time, local ionospheric measurements, e.g., by a modem digital ionosonde. The ionosonde could then be required to monitor the state of the ionosphere, compare it with model conditions, and forecast the radar refraction environment in real time. One component in this problem is the calculation of the radar refraction effects, given the ionospheric electron density profile, the apparent radar range, and look angle. Assuming that the electron density depends on height only, this paper describes such a procedure suitable for use within the Dynasonde or a similar digital ionosonde interfaced to an active radar system."
"The propagation of high frequency electromagnetic waves through an ionosphere perturbed by a gaussian electron density trough is investigated using a three-dimensional ray-tracing computer program. Ray trajectories are presented for a normalized model ionosphere with troughs of varying width, depth, and distance from the transmitter. Focussing and defocussing effects are demonstrated to occur under special circumstances. Particular emphasis is placed upon simulation of records from fixed- and swept-frequency sounding equipment. In particular, a moving trough is found to have unique Doppler signature which may be useful for ground-based observational work."
"Natural radio noise received by the ISIS satellites in the polar and auroral regions often exhibits spin modulation. For noise in the whistler-mode frequency domain observed on seven high-latitude passes, the data indicate that temporal-spatial variations in the level of the noise source are not important on a time scale of one spin period, and thus the dependence of the signal on the attitude of the receiving dipole antenna can be studied. Relative variations in level during one half of a spin period have been synthesized by simply convolving the attitude dependence of the antenna impedance with a spatial distribution of electric vectors. The resonance cone angle, corresponding to the infinity in the refractive index, has been predicted to an accuracy of 3°, while the theoretical amplitude and shape of the modulation agree well with what is observed. It is found that longitudinal electric waves yield better agreement than transverse electromagnetic waves. In some cases, preferred horizontal propagation directions can be roughly identified. The computations confirm the relevance of established theory for the antenna impedance and the ion sheath."
"Radiation from a slot antenna surrounded by a plasma sheath moving parallel to an external magnetostatic field is considered. It is shown that the radiation pattern is inclined in the direction of the sheath motion as the velocity is increased except for the case where the condition of upper hybrid resonance is satisfied in the rest frame of the plasma. When such a relativistic upper hybrid resonance caused by the sheath motion arises for certain values of normalized plasma and cyclotron frequencies and the velocity parameter, a deep null and a rapid oscillation appear in the radiation pattern, and as a result the shape of the pattern is extremely deformed."
"A method is proposed by means of which the propagation constants and field components may be obtained for the surface waves supported by symmetrically inhomogeneous dielectric layers. The specific profile shape of the permittivity across the layer is nearly arbitrary. The characteristic equations from which the propagation constants for the even and odd TE and TM modes are obtained are expressed directly in terms of the Fourier expansion coefficients of the permittivity variation, and the field components are expressed in terms of solutions to the Hill equation. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the analysis for a specific family of dielectric profiles."
"Branch-cut integrals are used to calculate the reflection of transient pulses from the surface of a cold, lossy, semi-infinite plasma. For the case considered in detail, small to moderate losses and an impulse-incident waveform with transverse magnetic polarization, the reflected waveform is oscillatory for small losses (collision rate much less than the plasma frequency) but decays monotonically for a collision rate of half the plasma frequency. The reversal of polarity of the initial half cycle of the reflected waveform observed as the incidence angle increases through 45° is interpreted as a Brewster-angle phenomenon."
"The boundary value problem posed is a truncated cylindrical region excited by a specified distribution of electric current over a concentric cylindrical surface. The end conditions are that the total normal current density is zero. The solution is carried through for excitation by a symmetrically located axial current filament that is adjacent to the cylinder. Numerical results of the resultant magnetic field are given for the quasi-static situation for a perfectly conducting cylinder. It is indicated that the results depend significantly on the length of the cylindrical target. Even for very long cylinders, there is no quantitative similarity with the corresponding two-dimensional model of a cylinder of infinite length."
"The effects of pressure and temperature variations on the determination of water-vapor densities from ruby-laser radar returns are considered. At the center of the 6943.8-Å water-vapor line, the thermal dependence of the absorption cross section is almost negligible while the pressure dependence is not. Water-vapor densities should be deduced from the line strength, which is independent of pressure, rather than the absorption coefficient as has been done previously. The 6943.8-Å line strength and line width were measured over a fixed-length atmospheric path using a ruby laser as 0.17 cm−1 g−1 cm2 and 0.098 cm−1 bar−1 (295 K), respectively, with standard error estimates of 16 and 9%."
"A 2.5-km long slewable broadside receiving-antenna array was used to study ionospherically propagated backscatter from the Pacific Ocean. Swept-frequency continuous-wave recordings revealed a new type of amplitude variation, periodic in both time delay and radio frequency, which caused recordings of time delay versus frequency to resemble large thumbprints. This new phenomenon was seen frequently during the fall and winter and also during spring and summer evenings. It is shown that magnetoionic splitting in the ionosphere (polarization rotation) was responsible for a modulation on the received backscatter signals. This concept was verified experimentally by switching the polarization of the transmitting antenna between vertical and horizontal. Computer ray tracing was used to contract a synthetic backscatter record displaying lines of signal enhancement due to polarization rotation. When the receiving antenna beamwidth is broadened from 1/2 to 4° the amplitude variation due to polarization rotation is undetectable, which probably explains why the effect was not positively identified in backscatter using F-layer propagation taken prior to the availability of the 2.5-km array. This result is also explained by the use of computer ray tracing. The modulation lines have not been seen to date by the author in recordings of backscatter from the land, probably because of the irregularities of backscattering from land surfaces."
"Oblique ionograms are made monostatically by using an HF sounder to record the delay times of echoes from known ground targets as a function of operating frequency. Cooperative sources, such as repeaters, or distinctive terrain features, such as cities, serve effectively as known ground targets. An analytic method is developed to transform oblique-backscatter ionograms into the h'-f curves recorded by conventional ionosondes at vertical incidence, from which ionospheric electron-density profiles can be derived. The validity of the transformation technique is demonstrated by comparing h'-f data recorded simultaneously at oblique incidence and at vertical incidence near the midpoint of the oblique path."
"A phenomenological model for D-region partial-reflection experiments, which includes the effects of turbulent scattering, measurement noise, and coherent returns, is examined. General results for the amplitude and phase-difference statistics of the ordinary- and extraordinary-mode signals are obtained. These results are specialized and discussed for cases in which either the measurement noise or the coherent-signal component is insignificant. A possible criterion for discriminating between turbulence models and a single reflecting-layer model on the basis of amplitude statistics is obtained."
"Histograms of phase-difference data for ordinary- and extraordinary-mode signals reflected from the D region of the ionosphere are compared with two phenomenological scattering models: (a) a small-scale homogeneous turbulence model and (b) a single reflecting-layer model. Although the turbulence model fits the data somewhat better than the single reflecting-layer model does, the predictions of both models are in surprisingly close agreement on virtually all aspects of differential-phase data. In particular, both models are shown to predict a broadening of the histograms with increasing altitude as found experimentally. This is attributed to the increasing difference between the differential phases of signals scattered from the top and bottom of the scattering volume. Thus, by operating at a higher frequency or using a shorter or a coded pulse, one should obtain useful differential-phase data at higher altitudes."
"A previously reported method of exact calculation of ray-path parameters for a spherically symmetric ionosphere with its center of curvature displaced from the center of the earth is extended to permit the synthesis of three-dimensional ionograms, i.e., group path, azimuthal angle of arrival, and elevation angle of arrival versus frequency, for a specified set of transmitter and receiver locations. An example of a synthesized three-dimensional ionogram is presented."
"The exact integral solution is obtained for the fields of a small circular loop that is coaxially located in a cylindrical borehole in homogeneous rock. The result is employed to calculate the mutual impedance between two coaxial loops within the borehole. It is found that, under most conditions, mutual impedance does not depend on the presence of the borehole, and thus the configuration is well suited for electromagnetic probing of the host rock."
"Recently published results on D-region partial-reflection amplitude distributions indicate that below 80 km, the distributions are Rayleigh-like in character. Because of this, this paper describes a model of the partial-reflection mechanism which employs multiple reflectors as opposed to the single-reflector concept now in use by most experimenters using the partial-reflection experiment. The particular new feature incorporated by this model is the variation of the reflection coefficient throughout the reflecting volume; previous multiple-reflector models considered only the variation of the differential absorption in the reflecting volume. It is shown, for example, that for 50μsec pulse lengths, serious errors in electron density can result in the analysis of partial-reflection data for which multiple reflectors are present."
"The pattern-recognition technique to be described requires the simultaneous recording of a signal on two antennas, for example, orthogonal magnetic or electric sensors; after these signals are cross-correlated, a fast Fourier transform yields the complex cross-spectrogram. Provided that the polarization of the waves does not vary rapidly with time, it is possible to reject unwanted noise and to recognize the signal by utilizing the phase information in the cross-spectrum. This technique has been tested using computer-simulated signals, and it has been found that variable frequency signals, for example, whistlers, which are more than 12 db below an incoherent-noise background and more than 18 db below a coherent-noise background, are still recognized and are recorded to the exclusion of noise. The technique is applicable to plasma waves recorded on spacecraft as well as to electromagnetic waves. Although the polarizations of ground-recorded VLF signals are usually more complicated than those in the magnetosphere, the method is still relevant."
"An experimental demonstration has been given of the initiation of a vortex-forming instability in sheets of charge by perturbations in the shape of the sheet. The net motion of charge along the sheet wherever the sheet is bent is shown to be related to displacement of the potential minimum in the sheet. These results suggest the existence of an instability in current sheets which also produces vortex forms. There is evidence that both of these instabilities result in the formation of vortexes in the aurora."
"Based upon a boundary-value formulation, a new approximate expression is derived for the total axial current on an infinite antenna immersed in an unbounded, cold, collisional magnetoplasma with a dc magnetic field oriented parallel to the antenna. Numerical results are presented for the current distributions over plasma parameters corresponding to each of the eight regions of the Clemmow-Mullaly-Allis diagram and for different values of the collision frequency. These results show that the propagation constant of the current wave on the antenna is very nearly equal to $k_{0}(K_{\\perp})^{1/2}$."
"The impedance of a short cylindrical dipole antenna in a hot uniaxial plasma is calculated. The hot-plasma effects are found to be specially important for very low frequencies. For these frequencies the results of the cold- and hot-plasma theories differ appreciably. As ω → 0 the cylindrical dipole is found to be capacitive rather than inductive as predicted by the cold-plasma approximation."
"The scattering of plane waves from a moving perfectly conducting cylinder is treated in the general case of arbitrary velocity and oblique incidence. This is a generalization of the cases previously treated in the literature and includes discussion of an additional phenomenon, mode coupling, which does not occur in the cases treated previously. Attention is focused on the depolarized component of the scattered field as it is one of the more apparent manifestations of the mode coupling. In addition, Doppler shift is discussed, and scattered power is calculated in the far fields of a thin wire. It is shown that, to first order in β = v/c, Doppler shift depends only on the component of velocity which is perpendicular to the cylinder and in the plane of incidence and that an azimuthal component of scattered power exists which does not occur in the absence of motion. The treatment is relativistically correct."
"The major obstacle in utilizing recently allocated frequency bands in the mm-wave spectrum for earth-satellite communications is rain attenuation. Since heavy rain is generally quite localized it has been proposed that the required reliability could be achieved through path diversity, which requires two or more earth receiving terminals. This paper describes a year-long diversity experiment in the Boston area involving two sun trackers separated by 7 mi and operating at 35 GHz."
"Experimental height-gain data for the magnitude of electromagnetic groundwaves propagating over flat homogeneous paths were obtained by microwave (4.765 GHz) modeling. The experimental results were compared with height-gain theory, and the limitations of the theory were established in terms of surface impedance, height of the receiving point, and antenna separation distance. Earlier experimental studies of this problem have not been entirely conclusive due to an inadequate knowledge of the surface impedance and the influence of the surface upon the antenna impedance. Here, extensive corrective measures were taken to eliminate or account for these effects. It is concluded that the theory for the total field is remarkably accurate as the height above or distance along the surface is varied, even at distances as close as 2\\0 from the source. Furthermore, the question as to the choice between the various forms of numerical distance seems academic. The restriction on height above the surface is eliminated, and the restriction upon the magnitude of the surface impedance is relaxed depending upon the presence of a significant trapped surface wave. Part 2 is a companion paper which relates the homogeneous path height-gain to mixed-path experimental measurements versus height and distance."
"Analytical as well as experimental height-gain studies for mixed-path groundwave propagation are virtually nonexistent. Therefore, it was shown how the theoretical height-gain for a homogeneous path relates to heterogeneous-path experimental measurements versus height and distance. The results show that the magnitude of a groundwave field which crosses an abrupt boundary rapidly acquires the characteristic properties of the second medium, and the field over a heterogeneous surface attenuates at essentially the same rate as the field on the surface. The groundwave which has crossed an abrupt boundary can be predicted for small heights above the surface by simply multiplying the well-established mixed-path theory for antennas located on the surface by appropriate homogeneous-path height-gain factors corresponding to the local surface impedance, provided the field is predominantly a surface wave."
"An experimental program to measure in-situ values of the electrical resistivity and surface impedance of sea ice at VLF was carried out at Point Barrow, Alaska. Temperature, salinity, and resistivity were measured as a function of depth in the ice for both first-year and multiyear sea ice by means of cored samples. All three quantities varied with the age of the ice, and, in addition, the resistivity varied with age from 102 ohm m to 104 ohm m at the surface and in general down to a few ohm m at the sea-water interface. The wavetilt of a VLF plane wave propagating over sea ice is theoretically linearly dependent on the thickness. Measurements of the quadrature phase wavetilt at 18.6 kHz give values that are of the right order of magnitude but erratic in local behavior. Short-spacing Wenner array resistivity measurements and telluric current measurements at VLF demonstrated that the erratic behavior was due to significant horizontal variations of the sea-ice resistivity over distances of a few m."
"Computations are made of the forward- and back-scattering intensities of oblate spheroidal raindrops at 19.3 and 34.8 GHz, assuming plane waves at normal incidence to the drop axis. Two kinds of polarization are considered in the incident field: one is parallel to drop axis; the other is perpendicular. Numerical values of these basic scattering intensities are listed in tables. Forward-scattering intensities are then used for determining the effective propagation constants of rain-filled space. From these propagation constants, attenuations and phase rotations for parallel and perpendicular polarizations are computed for several rain rates. One significant conclusion is that the difference between phase rotations in the two polarizations at 19.3 GHz becomes very large as the rain rate increases, whereas that at 34.8 GHz is bounded in a very small range throughout all possible rain rates."
"A new technique has been developed for measuring irregularity structure and velocity in the ionospheric E and F regions. The Arecibo incoherent-scatter radar was modified to measure electron-density profiles simultaneously with two beams: one fixed beam pointed at the zenith, and a second beam could be varied over 360° in azimuth and from 2 to 20° in zenith angle. Fluctuations in ionization density were observed to drift from one beam to the other so that information was obtained about both the horizontal velocity and the structure of these disturbances. Velocities of 100 to 200 m sec−1 and horizontal scale sizes of 50 to 100 km were deduced for the E region and roughly 400 m sec−1 and 500 km for the F region. A plot of velocity versus altitude shows a spiral structure with a vertical wavelength of 20 to 30 km in the E region."
"Following Cicerone and Bowhill [1970a, b, 1971] a Monte Carlo method is adopted as a basis for the derivation of the photoelectron-heat input into the ionospheric plasma. Considering that the size of the source elements must be small compared with the range over which photoelectrons dissipate their energy, a great number of Monte Carlo runs are required normally for the computation of the heating rates. This approach is modified in an attempt to minimize the computation time. The heat-input distributions are computed for arbitrarily small source elements that are spaced apart at distances corresponding to the photoelectron dissipation range. By means of a nonlinear interpolation procedure their individual heating-rate distributions are utilized to produce synthetic ones that fill the gaps between the Monte Carlo generated distributions. By varying these gaps and the corresponding number of Monte Carlo runs the accuracy of the results is tested to verify the validity of this procedure. It is concluded that this model can reduce the computation time by as much as an order of magnitude, thus improving the feasibility of including Monte Carlo calculations in self-consistent ionosphere models."
"A convenient ω-θ plot for the group index of refraction is introduced for studying the radiated field from transient current sources of arbitary orientations in anisotropic cold plasmas. The plot is valid not only for the far zone, but also for the near zone with large time. Typical numerical examples are given to provide the quantitative insight of the transient response in anisotropic cold plasmas."
"The radiation of an arbitrary source in a stratified system including anisotropic slabs is considered. Starting from an abstract-operator formulation given by Bresler and Marcuvitz [1956, 1957], the transverse field is evaluated by using a Fourier-integral representation. The Green's function is expressed through the evaluation of the source-free solutions. The scattered field and the plane-wave response are examined. An example is given concerning the field radiated in the presence of an anisotropic ferrite slab. The far field is evaluated through a saddle-point integration."
"The problem of diffraction of an E-polarized plane wave by a perfectly conducting wedge, having the illuminated side loaded with a thin dielectric slab of which the relative permittivity is not much larger than unity, is treated. The solution is given in an integral form, consisting of geometrical optics and associated diffraction terms, by applying an approximate boundary condition at the dielectric surface. The diffraction integrals involved are evaluated asymptotically in terms of Fresnel's integrals. Using the reciprocity principle, the results are extended to the cylindrical-wave excitation. The validity of the results is verified by comparison with experiment for the case of a dipole-fed dielectric-loaded strip."
"The appropriate form for the surface impedance of a radial-wire ground screen is utilized to obtain quantitative effects of the important parameters (number of radials, length of radials, wire radius, and ground constants) on the low-angle radiation of a vertical antenna. An approximate correction term is derived to account for currents reflected from the edge of the screen. The effect is small for large screens, but it may be important for smaller screens."

"The open-source mass spectrometer will be used to obtain the number densities of the neutral atmospheric gases in the mass range 1 to 48 amu at the satellite location. The ion source has been designed to allow gas particles to enter the ionizing region with the minimum practicable number of prior collisions with surfaces. This design minimizes the loss of atomic oxygen and other reactive species due to reactions with the walls of the ion source. The principal features of the open-source spectrometer and the laboratory calibration system are discussed."
"The neutral-atmosphere composition experiment instrumentation is designed to obtain in-situ measurements of neutral thermosphere composition from Atmosphere Explorer-C, -D, and -E. The system is based on previously flown OGO-6 and San Marco-3 composition instruments. The mass-spectrometer sensor includes a gold-plated thermalizing chamber and ion source, a hyperbolic rod quadrupole analyzer, and an off-axis electron multiplier. Automatic ion-source sensitivity control and pulse-counting techniques provide density measurement capability from approximately 125 to 1000 km altitude. The normal operating mode includes measurement at all masses in the range 1 to 44 amu with emphasis on hydrogen, helium, oxygen, nitrogen, and argon. Additional operational modes are optimized for minor constituent studies of any individual gas in this mass range."
"The determination of the temperature of the neutral gas at the location of the satellite is based on measurement of the velocity distribution of the molecular nitrogen. Measurement of the thermal-velocity component in the presence of the free-stream velocity will be obtained through application of the velocity-scan technique and, independently, through use of a baffle technique. A 3-cm diameter spherical sampling chamber with a 0.5-cm diameter precisely-knife-edged orifice is located at the satellite equator to permit free diffusion of atmosphere gases between the chamber interior and the atmosphere. The spherical chamber is connected through a high-conductance tube to a quadrupole mass-spectrometer sensor to permit accurate quantitative evaluation of the density of the gas. The spectrometer, tuned to N2 for most of the measuring time, will also be tuned to other gases for exploratory purposes. The accuracy of the temperature data is expected to be better than 5%. The altitude range, determined primarily by system snr at the upper altitudes and mean-free-path limitations at the lower altitudes, is expected to be from 130 to 400 km."
"A triaxial-accelerometer system will be included in each of the Atmosphere Explorer (AE) payloads. The instrument consists of three uniaxial miniature-electrostatic-accelerometer units mounted mutually at right angles. This paper provides a description of the accelerometer system being designed for AE. It includes the principles of the instrument operation, the measurement capabilities, and the relation between the measured data and the scientific and engineering results. The functions of the instrument are to determine the density of the neutral atmosphere, monitor the thrust of the orbit-adjust propulsion system, determine the satellite minimum altitude, measure spacecraft roll, and provide some attitude-sensing information. Measurements will be made four times per second or approximately once every 2 km of flight path. Density variations will be determined with an accuracy ranging from approximately 1% below 200 km to 10% at 350 km, not including any error in ephemeris or drag coefficient."
"Absolute pressure measurements are made by two instruments aboard Atmosphere Explorer (AE): a cold-cathode ion gauge and a capacitance manometer. The dual sensors feature coverage from 120 to 370 km with double coverage below 200 km, differing and complementary sensing techniques, usable output in the spinning and both normal and inverted despun satellite modes, simple formatting to facilitate data use for real-time monitoring of spacecraft operation, and cross-calibration in the laboratory and in space."
"The magnetic ion-mass spectrometer is designed to measure the abundances of the ambient positive ions in the ionosphere. It will be calibrated in flight against the retarding-potential analyzer and the cylindrical electrostatic probe to give absolute concentration data for the ion species detected. These parameters can be measured to approximately ±10% in well-behaved regions where concentrations are above 103 cm−3. However, in highly structured polar regions, some degradation in accuracy may be expected. Three mass ranges, covered simultaneously by the scan of the instrument, 1 to 4, 4 to 16, and 16 to 64 amu, permit measurement of the entire mass range, 1 to 64 amu, in 1 sec in the main (peaks) mode. An alternate mode, analog-long, will extend the mass range to 90 amu with a 9-sec period. Capability is provided to lock onto any set of mass numbers in the ratio 1:4:16 to give very high spatial resolution, e.g., 500, 250, and 125 m in the low-, mid-, and high-mass ranges, respectively. This mode will be most useful in the despun satellite orientation to provide fine-structure data on ion concentrations. In the spinning mode the phase shifts between roll modulation maxima of heavy and light ions determine the vertical component of the individual ion-drift velocities. Values from a few km sec−1 to over 20 km sec−1 can be determined. Such data are applicable to the study of polar wind phenomena."
"The Bennett spectrometer to be flown on Atmosphere Explorer-C and -E (AE-C and AE-E) is designed to measure, throughout the 120 to 4000-km orbit, the concentrations of all thermal positive ions in the mass range 1 to 72 amu and number density range 5 to 5 × 106 ions cm−3. To reduce the buildup of ram pressure and facilitate measurements at low altitude, the analyzer is vented, and a multigrid ion-current collector is employed. An extensive command capability permits optimization of instrument parameters for particular measurement objectives; commandable functions include mass-scan range and period, the sensitivity-resolution characteristic of the analyzer, orifice potential, and in-flight calibration. Any combination of three mass ranges (1 to 4, 2 to 18, 8 to 72 amu) may be selected as the mass-scan mode; each range is normally scanned in 1.6 sec, corresponding to a distance of 12 km along the orbit. Ion spectra will be simultaneously telemetered in both analog and digital form; the digital data result from on-board processing of the analog spectra and consist only of ion-peak coordinates. The three overlapping mass ranges will enable in-flight evaluation of mass discrimination within the ion analyzer. Verification of absolute instrument sensitivity will require correlation of the spectrometer data with results from the companion electrostatic probe and retarding-potential analyzer. Such correlations should permit individual ion concentrations to be determined with an accuracy of ±10%."
"A planar retarding-potential analyzer will be included in each of the Atmosphere Explorer (AE) payloads. The primary functions of the instrument are to supply ion-temperature and ion-concentration data, which it will do at least once every 40 km of flight path in the region of interest with an expected accuracy of better than 2%. In addition, the instrument will determine ion-drift velocities and energy spectra of both the thermal and suprathermal electrons. During eclipse, negative-ion concentrations greater than 0.3 cm−3 can be detected, though the normal positive-ion sensitivity is approximately 1.5 ions cm−3. Changes in the ion concentration along the flight path greater than 0.1% can be monitored with a spatial resolution of less than 40 m."
"This paper briefly describes the cylindrical electrostatic probes to be used on the new Atmosphere Explorer-C, -D, and -E, and outlines the methods to be employed to analyze the experimental data in terms of electron temperature and ion and electron concentration. Two independent cylindrical sensors and partially redundant electronic systems permit greater reliability in measurements. Measurements are made at 1-sec and 2-sec intervals along the orbit. The sensors themselves have been modified from previous applications to cope with the lower electron temperature expected in these low-altitude orbits and to counter possible surface contamination caused by the hydrazine engines used for orbit adjustments."
"An extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrophotometer for measurements of solar radiation at wavelengths ranging from 140 to 1850 Å will be included in the payload of each of the three Atmosphere-Explorer (AE) missions, AE-C, -D, and -E. The instrument consists of 24 grating monochromators, 12 of which can be telecommanded either to execute 128-step scans each covering a relatively small section of the total spectrophotometer wavelength range or to maintain fixed (command-selected) wavelength positions. The remaining 12 nonscan monochromators operate at permanently fixed wavelengths and view only a small fraction of the solar disk except for one viewing the whole sun in H Lyman α. Ten of the 12 scan-capable monochromators also view the entire solar disk since their primary function is to measure the total fluxes independent of the distribution of sources across the solar disk. The narrow angular fields of view of the other monochromators allow good height resolution of atmospheric-absorption analyses to be extended to altitudes as low as 90 to 100 km, based on occultation observations made near satellite sunrise and sunset."
"A broadband photometer experiment is being prepared for the Atmosphere Explorer-C, -D, and -E missions to record the solar irradiance in seven wavelength bands in the range from 40 to 1250 Å. The experiment contains four spiral electron multipliers located behind a moving eight-position filter wheel. Six of the eight sections of this wheel contain metallic filters used to spectrally isolate the solar irradiance. In addition, three Al2O3 diodes, two with filters, are being used to record the solar irradiance over the full range of orbital altitudes including those at which operation of multipliers with high voltages on open structures would be unsafe. A principal goal of the experiment will be to measure time dependence of the solar irradiance. Photometric calibration will be based on preflight exposure to a storage-ring synchrotron light source which has been calibrated by combining synchrotron theory with the absolute values of irradiance at 4000 Å obtained from comparison with the best available standard of irradiance."
"The visible-airglow experiment is an airglow photometer designed to measure various thermospheric emission features during the day and night both at low latitudes and in auroras. The photometer has two distinct optical channels, a high-sensitivity channel with a large field of view and a low-sensitivity channel with a narrow field of view to resolve small features. The system is protected by a combination attenuator and cathode back-biasing scheme which allows measurements of maximum sensitivity within a fraction of a second of viewing the sun. This experiment will be a part of the scientific payload on all three Atmosphere Explorer missions."
"The UV nitric-oxide (UVNO) experiment on Atmosphere Explorer-C and -D (AE-C and AE-D) is a two-channel, fixed-grating Ebert spectrometer which will measure the airglow in the (1, 0) gamma band at 2150 Å. The observed intensity is produced by resonance fluorescence of sunlight by the NO molecules in the instrument's field of view, and the intensity profiles obtained will be inverted to yield altitude profiles of NO density. These density profiles will be obtained as functions of time and geographic location. The results will be used in investigations of the sources, sinks, and transport of NO and, in cooperation with other AE experiments, in investigations of thermospheric ion chemistry, the morphology of the turbopause, and auroral perturbations of the thermosphere."
"The Atmosphere Explorer (AE) photoelectron spectrometer experiment consists of electrostatic deflection-type electron spectrometers designed to measure the low-energy electron flux expected to be encountered along the AE orbit. The system has been designed to provide general information on the intensity, angular distribution, energy spectrum, and net flows along field lines as well as sufficient energy resolution to allow the fine details of the electron-energy spectrum to be studied. The instrumentation consists of two separate electron-spectrometer detector heads connected to a common electronics system for data processing and telemetry interfacing. The experiment will measure the electron-energy spectrum from 2 to 500 ev (and possibly to less than 0.1 ev). The energy resolution (ΔE/E) of the electron spectrometers will be approximately 2.5% full width half maximum. The geometrical factor of the analyzers will be approximately 10−3 cm2 ster, independent of electron energy. Placement on the spacecraft will be arranged so as to give as little interference as possible from shadowing of electron trajectories by the spacecraft and contamination of the observed spectra by locally generated photoelectrons."
"The low-energy electron experiment will provide differential measurements of the energy influx and angular distributions of electrons and protons on the Atmosphere Explorer-C and -D missions. The detectors consist of cylindrical electrostatic analyzers for species and energy selection and Spiraltron electron multipliers as particle sensors. The C version will contain three detectors, two measuring electrons and protons from 0.2 to 25 kev in 16 logarithmically-spaced steps and one measuring 5 kev electrons continuously. Angular distributions will be acquired utilizing the spin of the spacecraft. The D version will contain 19 detectors, one proton-stepped energy analyzer, and two electron-stepped energy analyzers at two different angles, again over the energy range 0.2 to 25 kev. In addition it will contain 16 fixed-energy detectors which will obtain high time-resolution angular distributions in the spacecraft one-revolution-per-orbit mode at five energies between 0.2 and 5 kev. Increase of these energies by a factor of 3.5 will be possible by ground command."
"A three-axis fluxgate magnetometer/analog-to-digital converter system will be included in the Atmosphere Explorer-D and -E payloads. The scientific function of this system (the magnetometer experiment) is to measure magnetic fields due to field-aligned and ionospheric currents, particularly in the auroral region. These currents relate to the magnetosphere-ionosphere and solar wind-ionosphere coupling and represent a considerable source of energy input into the auroral ionosphere. Attempts will also be made to measure the magnetic fields of the equatorial electrojet and other ionospheric current systems, although stray spacecraft fields might preclude these measurements. Each magnetometer axis will be sampled ≈ 8 times per second to a resolution of at least 5γ (lγ = 10−9 Wb m−2). For this experiment, good resolution (≈ 0.007% of the maximum magnetic field to be encountered) and a high sampling rate are much more important than absolute accuracy of the measurements, since systematic errors in absolute accuracy simply shift an already arbitrary baseline level."

"Harbingers of significant magnetospheric motions consist of the interactions of interplanetary discontinuities with the standing bow shock. The most common discontinuity is the tangential discontinuity. Less frequent in occurrence, but of major significance to subsequent magnetospheric dynamics, is the flare-generated interplanetary shock wave and its initiation of bow shock and magnetopause motion toward Earth. Early studies utilized the ordinary gas-dynamic analogy of the well-known Riemann splitting of an initial discontinuity (i.e., bow shock) into a reflected shock (the moving bow shock) and the transmitted shock (the inward-moving interplanetary shock). It was shown that order-of-magnitude pressure increases at the subsolar point of the magnetopause are readily found for typical shock-on-shock studies. Phenomenological studies also demonstrated, in agreement with observations, that the magnetopause motion could be predicted on the basis of quasi-static variation of the solar wind dynamic pressure. Recent hydromagnetic studies (for the simplified case of perpendicular shocks) have extended the theory to predict bow shock and magnetopause velocities which appear to be observed by spacecraft. Such one-dimensional studies provide upper limits for all average plasma parameters within the region of the Sun-Earth axis. The general case of the time-dependent interaction in three dimensions has, as yet, not been done. Nevertheless, the general configurational and plasma details are, in principle, amenable to examination with the use of multiple spacecraft measurements during the interaction and the ensuing dynamic motions on a time scale of tens of min to the several hr required for the magnetopause to move to smaller geocentric distances. The physical processes of various energy transfers from kinetic to thermal and magnetic as predicted by the hydromagnetic theory could then be assessed by study of the plasma average velocity, direction of flow, magnetic field, temperature, and density. The magnetosheath plasma properties following such interactions could, on a more speculative note, provide new boundary conditions (associated with appropriate magnetosheath and magnetosphere magnetic field polarities) which could, in turn, initiate and drive the reconnection process within the magnetopause."
"To the present date only the reconnection process for exactly antiparallel fields has been discussed in detail. In magnetospheric terms this restricts us to the consideration only of southward interplanetary fields. The qualitative study presented here shows how reconnection takes place between arbitrarily oriented fields in infinite and finite geometries. The process may best be thought of as a continuous exchange of field-line partners during the time a field line maps into the diffusion region. In a finite geometry the diffusion regions lie on field lines which connect neutral points of the field configuration, and along which a potential drop is imposed. Although the discussion here centers principally on the magnetosphere, the described reconnection process and field topology should also be applicable to other astrophysical problems."
"The three-dimensional problem of magnetopause merging has been analyzed using an extension of Alfven's neutral-sheet field annihilation model. That model has been generalized for an arbitrary magnitude and direction of the interplanetary magnetic field. The analysis provides a quantitative prediction of the merging rate that is consistent with the observed dependence of geomagnetic activity on the direction and magnitude of the interplanetary magnetic field."
"We briefly review the results of a laboratory field-line reconnection experiment. In doing so the flux transfer rate is defined and contrasted with magnetic Mach numbers as measures of the reconnection rate. We examine the origin of the reconnection electric field to determine some of the requirements of nonsteady versus steady reconnection. The dependence of various measures of the reconnection rate on electrical conductivity is discussed as well as some experimental features which may relate to previous theory. Finally, we present some approximate scaling between laboratory events and the geomagnetic substorm. We reach three major conclusions: (a) The flux transfer rate as a measure of the reconnection rate is different from a magnetic Mach number, (b) The early reconnection process is quasi-steady state or “Petschek-like” and we associate this phase with magnetic energy storage. A later rapid flux transfer event is more energetic and is associated with storm events. The flux transfer event is triggered by a change in resistivity, (c) The laboratory event scales reasonably well to the duration and energy of a substorm."
"The magnetospheric morphology is reviewed using the method of the AB topology. Typical examples of AB profiles along individual passes of OGO-5 in the morning hours and near noon are given, supplementing similar data presented earlier. These results demonstrate the significance of the equatorial current system in the distortions of the magnetospheric field in its quiet state. A preliminary study of the differences between the observed inclination, 1, and 1 calculated from a reference field, and the corresponding differences in declination, D, shows that Δ1 and ΔD are larger than expected from the existing models. The magnitudes of Δl at low latitudes are larger in the dusk sector than in the dawn sector, suggesting that the equatorial inner magnetosphere is more inflated near dusk than near dawn. The ΔD data show that the bending of the field lines toward the tail is greater in the dusk than in the dawn sector. To account for the large ΔD values at midlatitudes it is suggested that they are caused by field-aligned currents flowing from the dusk end of the cross-tail current to the ionosphere and returning to the tail from the ionosphere on the morning side."
"From geomagnetic records of sixteen observatories distributed about the earth, a spectral analysis of the geomagnetic field was prepared for each day of 1965, a year of relatively quiet solar-terrestrial activity. Field amplitudes were found to increase almost linearly with periods in the 5 min to 2 hr range of study. The northward and eastward components of field are about equal at all latitudes with slightly larger vaues of H in the auroral and equatorial electrojet region. The vertical component of field is less than the others at all but the auroral zones. Seasonal changes in the amplitude appear at all locations but are more pronounced in the polar cap. Summer solstitial field strengths are about twice those of the winter period. On most quiet days of a month the amplitudes vary from about 0.5 to 0.1 times that of the monthly average levels. On most active days of the month the fields are between 4 to 10 times the size of the average monthly level amplitudes. The greatest variations in these levels occur at the equatorial and auroral zones. The lowest field values occur between 10° and 35° geomagnetic latitude with a minimum near 20° to 25°. Maximum values of the field are found at 65° to 75° geomagnetic latitude. Allowing for induced currents within the earth and for the global area of the distribution, about 91% of the magnetic energy is found between 60° and 80° geomagnetic latitude, about 4% in the higher latitude polar cap, and only 1% between the equator and 15°."
"The meaning and characteristics of basic and average convection (i.e., electric field) patterns are described. The continuous existence of the basic convection pattern argues against treating magnetic field merging mechanisms as the fundamental cause of magnetospheric convection. However, whether related to merging or to some other mechanism, interplanetary magnetic field conditions significantly modulate the distribution, magnitudes, and boundaries of the convection pattern. A previous correlation between azimuthal, ϕ, angles of the interplanetary magnetic field and asymmetries in polar cap electric field distributions as seen by OGO-6 is reviewed. A new approach is taken to reveal correlations with the north-south, θ, angle and magnitude, B, of the interplanetary field as well as additional features which correlate with the ϕ angle. Both significant correlations and conditions which show a lack of correlation are found. Several aspects of the correlations appear to be particularly important. One is that for a given ϕ angle, correlations exist relative to θ independent of B and relative to B independent of θ. A second is that shifts in the latitude of the low altitude limit of the auroral belt convection are strongly correlated with all parameters (ϕ, θ, B)."
"The guiding center equations are solved numerically to follow 200 ev protons with pitch angles near the loss cone from the dayside magnetosheath on the noon meridian to their mirror height in a model open magnetosphere. We examine the effect of magnetic field line curvature and electric field strength upon proton mirror heights. We find that when the magnetic field has dipole-like curvature along a dayside proton trajectory an increase in the strength of the dawn-dusk electric field will result in an increase of the proton mirror height. When there exists significant nondipole-like magnetic field curvature along a dayside proton trajectory an increase in the dawn-dusk electric field strength can result in lower proton mirror heights. In our model, when the interplanetary magnetic field is directed northward or southward the latitude dependence of changes in proton mirror height resulting from changed dawn-dusk electric field strength is the same along the noon-midnight meridian over the northern and southern polar caps, but when the interplanetary magnetic field vector lies in the noon-midnight meridian plane at an angle to the earth dipole axis, proton mirror height behavior in response to electric field strength changes is different over the northern and southern polar caps. Proton drift perpendicular to the magnetic field but having a component parallel to the electric field can result in kinetic energy changes of up to 25% as a proton moves from the magnetosheath to its mirror height."
"By considering only those periods when the delay time from the interplanetary observing position to the magnetosphere is less than about 5 min, it is found that irrespective of substorm activity: (a) the 45-min average value of interplanetary Bz predicts the latitudes of the poleward and equatorward boundaries of polar cusp electron precipitation with rms errors of 1.34° and 1.16° respectively; (b) both boundaries move equatorward by about 5° as Bz varies from 0 to —6γ, the cusp remaining about 4° wide; (c) the amount of flux added to the polar cap is about 9.2% of the total southward flux impingent on the magnetosphere in the previous 45 min; and (d) as Bz becomes more positive, the equatorward boundary moves only slightly more poleward ($\\frac{1}{2}\\degree$ between Bz = 2γ and Bz = 6γ), while the poleward boundary moves significantly toward higher latitudes, resulting in a cusp approximately 7° wide for Bz = 6γ. This dependence of the width of the cusp on positive Bz suggests that reconnection between the IMF (interplanetary magnetic field) and open geomagnetic field lines (which are southward near the dayside magnetopause) is facilitated when the IMF is northward, allowing deeper penetration of magnetosheath plasma into the high latitude magnetosphere."
"A correlation of the interplanetary magnetic field sector structures including the east-west component with the polar geomagnetic field variations has recently been suggested by several scientists. To clarify the details of the correlation and to facilitate discussion of the physical mechanism involved in the interaction, 2.5-min digitized geomagnetic data from 40 stations located from the northern polar cap through the southern subauroral zone are examined during quiet days in 1965. The Sqp equivalent overhead current systems are investigated with respect to seasonal changes and variations corresponding to toward- and away-sector structures by the technique of spherical harmonic expansions of the data. In addition to obvious seasonal variations of the Sqp, a clear shift of the average Sqp pattern toward the afternoon (early morning) side of the polar cap for the toward-sector (away-sector) structure is obtained. Furthermore, small but remarkable sector effects on the quiet geomagnetic field in middle and low latitudes are discovered. The results of this work contribute to the discussion of sector structure effects on magnetic field merging at the magnetopause and convective patterns in the magnetosphere."
"A review is presented of theories and observations of current sheets in the magnetosphere, emphasizing the magnetopause and tail current sheets. Theoretical models of the magnetopause current sheet can be divided into two types: specular reflection and fluid models containing no external magnetic field, and models with an interplanetary/magnetosheath magnetic field. Our understanding of the first type is much better than of the second, although magnetospheric observations indicate that the external magnetic field plays an important role. Most of the theoretical models of the tail current sheet attempt to arrive at an understanding of the reconnection process or start with the assumption that reconnection is important. Observations are reviewed and implications for the models are discussed."
"The substorm-related thinning and thickening of the plasma sheet, processes that have been extensively studied at XSM ≈ —18 RE, occur at all distances in the magnetotail beyond XSM ≈ —10 to —15 RE in most substorms. These processes involve rapid flow of plasma out of and into the magnetotail and suggest the formation of magnetic neutral lines, first near the earth and then far out in the tail during a substorm. Evidence for these processes is discussed."
"Gyro-synchrotron radio noise emitted by electrons trapped in the Earth's magnetosphere has been a subject of extensive research. Previous efforts, which considered frequencies greater than 1 MHz, have shown that this noise should not be detectable in the MF to HF range because its intensity is below the cosmic background noise level. This author, however, has investigated the LF range and has found that appreciable noise is generated at these frequencies. In fact, the theoretical results for this LF noise agree very well with experimental data obtained by the Goddard Space Flight Center radio astronomy experiment aboard the IMP 6 spacecraft. A comparison showed that the model predicted both variation in the observed noise intensity with Kp and the noise spectral characteristics. Consequently, it is concluded that detectable LF radio noise is emitted, by means of the cyclotron-synchrotron mechanism, by electrons trapped in the Earth's magnetosphere, and that this noise is observable only for frequencies below about 300 kHz. For higher frequencies, the theoretical model and the experimental data reconfirm that this noise is below that of cosmic origin."
"The ion-cyclotron turbulent ring current precipitation model of magnetic storms is reexamined in light of recent experimental and theoretical developments. The ring current-plasmapause spatial coincidence results from the proton Alfvén layer shielding of the convection electric field. Observations indicate that the dominant ring current precipitation occurs outside the plasmasphere in agreement with recent theories of the high beta, large anisotropy ion cyclotron and electrostatic ion loss cone waves. Hydrogen arc proton precipitation may be caused by parallel electric fields at the equatorward edge of the auroral oval. During the main phase, convection may be both the source and major sink of the asymmetric ring current. During the rapid recovery phase, neutral-wind-induced convection may be the dominant ring current loss process. At this time there is no definitive evidence that ion cyclotron turbulence inside the plasmapause constitutes a major sink for the ring current or generates a SAR arc by electron Landau damping."
"Curved field-aligned currents in the magnetosphere produce a noticeable geomagnetic effect on the earth's surface not only in the D component but also in the H component. For geomagnetic bays or longitudinal asymmetry of ΔH (deviation in H from its quiet level) during magnetic storms, the contribution from the field-aligned currents is greater than that of a partial ring current. The Sq field also may be appreciably influenced by the field-aligned currents associated with the magnetospheric plasma convection."
"Significant small-scale convective motions can be generated by the presence of thermal plasma in the magnetosphere. An isolated plasma-filled flux tube at L = 4, of density 3 × 108 m−3 and temperature 3000 K, can convect away from the earth at a velocity on the order of 0.7 RE hr−1 at night, due to the electric field it creates. An interchange instability occurs at the plasmapause, with a growth rate on the order of 1.9 × 10−3 sec−1 at night, creating turbulence which tends to destroy the steep plasma density gradient. This instability can explain the gradual decrease of the density gradient observed during periods of decreasing magnetic activity. In order to maintain a steep density gradient, three possibilities are discussed: (a) reduction of the instability growth rate due to enhanced ionospheric conductance; (b) reduction of the growth rate due to the presence of radiation belt plasma and/or a sharp temperature increase at the plasmapause; and (c) rapid radial convergence of large-scale flow due to the presence of an Alfvén layer at the plasmapause. The self-induced convective motions may also be important in the production and/or redistribution of small-scale irregularities of thermal plasma observed both inside and outside the plasmapause."
"An interpretation is given for the high fluxes of 0+ ions with energies to 12 kev observed during the magnetic storm of 17 December 1971. It is suggested that the ions were accelerated initially by the absorption, near the altitude of the 0+ resonance (ω = Ω0+), of ion cyclotron waves amplified at a slightly lower altitude by ring current protons moving downward along magnetic field lines. The energized ions then moved toward higher altitudes along the field lines where they diffused in pitch angle and energy due to resonant interactions with ion cyclotron turbulence. The gradient of the geomagnetic field plays an important role in the amplification of the ion cyclotron waves at low altitudes. It is shown that ring current protons may lose considerable energy while resonating with ion cyclotron waves propagating upward. Conversely, ions may gain substantial energy while resonating with waves propagating downward. The observations of the 0+ ions are correlated with simultaneous measurements of the ring current protons, and it is argued that the observed energy loss of the protons near the plasmapause may be due to off-equatorial resonant interactions between the protons and ion cyclotron waves."
"Active experiments in the magnetosphere include some intended to be primarily diagnostic (barium release, electron guns) and others designed to perturb the system to generate instabilities (VLF or ULF wave injection from ground stations, ionospheric heating). Recently, a scheme has been proposed which would modify the magnetosphere by injecting plasma near the equator beyond the plasmapause and initiating wave-particle instabilities. The expected effects have been examined theoretically. Injection of plasma into this region is also a naturally occurring phenomenon produced by the cross-tail electric fields which are associated with geomagnetic activity. For further investigation of magnetospheric instabilities, the advantages of examining artificially injected plasma (control of time and location of injection and of the volume of plasma injected) contrast with the advantages of studying natural enhancements (no extra payload, frequent occurrence). Thus, the two types of experiments are complementary. In preliminary studies of natural plasma enhancements both ULF and ELF emissions have been observed. The ELF noise is consistent with generation by the electron cyclotron instability."
"Several important new observations of magnetospheric substorms now allow us to examine many substorm features in terms of the solar wind-magnetosphere dynamo and of four rates, the merging rate M of the interplanetary and geomagnetic field lines, the transport rate T of the merged field lines from the dayside magnetosphere to the magnetotail, the reconnection rate $\\cal{R}$ of the transported field lines and the return rate R of the reconnected field lines to the dayside magnetophere. It is shown that magnetospheric observations of great variety are consistently explainable by the deduced result that the expansive phase of a typical intense substorm occurs when the combination of the four rates is such that $M(\\sim T)\\uparrow,\\math{R}\\uparrow {\\rm and}\\ R\\uparrow, \\rm{but}\\ m > \\math{R} \\geq R,$ while a weak substorm occurs when the combination of the four rates is such that$M(\\sim T)=\\rm{const.} ,\\mathcal{R}\\uparrow,\\cal{R}\\downarrow \\rm{but}\\ \\mathcal{R} \\geq R,$ where an upward-pointing arrow denotes an increasing rate. The first combination corresponds to a negative Bs component of the interplanetary magnetic field, while the second one to a positive Bz component. Thus, the Bz component does not control triggering mechanisms of substorms, but does control the intensity of substorms. Indeed, there are also periods in which the combination may be such that M(∼T)↑, $\\cal{R}$ = const., R = const., which does not consistently result in substorm activity."
"Satellite studies of magnetospheric substorms are necessarily statistical since there are few properly instrumented satellites in space at any one time. To carry out these studies, one selects an ensemble of similar substorms, determines an origin for substorm time, and performs an ensemble average to eliminate noise. Similarity between different substorms can be determined from contour maps of midlatitude magnetic perturbations as a function of longitude and universal time. The origin of substorm time can also be determined from midlatitude perturbations and is usually taken as the beginning of the positive bay near midnight. Use of these techniques has led to a phenomenological model of magnetospheric substorms that includes a growth phase. The controversy over the existence of the growth phase is at least partially a consequence of differing definitions of the origin of substorm time. Use of auroral zone magnetograms often gives an earlier onset than midlatitude magnetograms. However, midlatitude onsets do appear to order satellite data systematically. In this paper we illustrate the discrepancy between these two onset times and show how midlatitude onsets order satellite data in agreement with the growth phase model. Three events of increasing complexity are considered. Each has been previously reported in the literature and later criticized. We speculate that a polar magnetic substorm begins when a pair of X- and O-type neutral lines form on closed field lines within the plasma sheet. Subsequently, the midlatitude positive bay begins when magnetic merging first encounters open field lines in the lobe of the tail."
"Results of a rocket flight are reported where electric fields and ion drifts have been measured between 100 and 192 km in the auroral ionosphere. Electric fields were measured by means of a double probe system, while ion drifts were derived from wake measurements. It is found that the electric field vector stays fairly constant over the indicated range in altitude, although a marked difference exists between the upleg and downleg measurements. The ion drift vector changes as expected from collision frequency profiles. By combining the electron drift vector, which is determined by the electric and magnetic field only, and the ion drift vector, it is possible to derive the current density profile for both the upleg and downleg of the trajectory. Again, a pronounced difference in current density profiles exists for upleg and downleg. The profiles obtained are consistent with ground-based magnetometer observations."

  "This standard sets forth evaluation techniques and instrumentation to determine the existence of a potentially hazardous situation due to electromagnetic radiation. The scope includes hazards to flammable volatile materials and explosive devices. Emphasis is on techniques suitable for measuring power density at microwave frequencies. These techniques are generally applicable only in the far field, but reasonably accurate measurements can be made whenever the following necessary conditions are satisfied. (1) The transmitting antenna and any scattering objects must be in the far field of the receiving antenna. (2) The receiving antenna must be at least several 'aperture diameters' removed from the transmitting antenna and any scattering objects. (3) The transmitting antenna and any sources of multipath scattering must be contained within the main beam of the receiving antenna. Thus, leakage measurements and measurements in the reactive near field are specifically excluded. However, measurements can be made in the radiating near field with a receiving antenna which is small compared to the source antenna if the three conditions above are satisfied."
