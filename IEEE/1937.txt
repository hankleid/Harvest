"This paper discusses the general requirements and design of Kinescope tubes for projecting television images. A picture 18×24 inches in size having a brightness in the high lights of 0.9 candle per square foot appears to be an acceptable minimum for home television reception. Several years of developmental work were required before the problems of designing a suitable projection system were clarified. This clarification led to a developmental Kinescope which closely approaches the minimum brightness requirements. The possibilities of further improvements in electron guns, fluorescent screen materials, and optical systems are discussed."
"One of the problems in the art of reproducing a scene by television is to obtain an image of adequate size. Because of this there has been considerable interest in projection systems where a small, high intensity image reproduced on the face of a projection Kinescope is thrown onto a viewing screen of the desired size by a suitable optical system. The light output and the definition of these systems has been limited by the inability of the electron gun to provide a sufficiently large beam current in a small spot. This paper describes an electron gun giving large beam current in a small spot. The design of this electron gun is based on the results of the present investigation which shows that the ratio of the current in the first crossover inside the radius r to the total space current is I/Is=1-ε-ar2E where E is the voltage applied to the first crossover forming system and a is a constant for any given cathode temperature, potential distribution, and geometry. Inasmuch as the total space current varies approximately as E3/2, the concentration of current in the first crossover increases very rapidly with voltage. A description is given of an electron gun based on this theory. All available voltage is used to form a small intense first crossover whose edges are sharply defined by a first crossover defining aperture. A magnetic final focusing lens reimages this first crossover on the fluorescent screen. This electron gun gives beam currents of 1."
"The current density in a focused beam of cathode rays is shown to have an upper limit defined by I = I0(Ee/kT+1) sin2φ, where I is the maximum current density obtainable in the focused spot, I0is the current density at the cathode, E is the voltage at the focus relative to the cathode, T is the absolute temperature of the cathode, e is the electronic charge, k is Boltzmann's constant, and φ is the half angle subtended by the cone of electrons which converge on the focused spot. The cases in which the focused spot is an image of the cathode, and in which it is a pupil, or \"crossover\", are considered separately, and the above formula is shown to apply to both. The necessary initial assumptions are (1) that electrons leave the cathode with a Maxwellian distribution of velocities, and (2) that the focusing system is free from aberrations and obeys the law of sines. Aberrations may reduce the current density, but nothing can raise it above the value defined. In the Appendix the focusing properties of a uniform accelerating field are calculated. The virtual image of a plane cathode formed by such a field suffers from spherical aberration. The diameter of the circle of least confusion formed by electrons from a single point is approximately equal to the distance the electrons can travel against the field by virtue of their initial velocities."
"Several of the characteristics of a cathode-ray tube which determine its usefulness as a Kinescope for television reception are outlined. Various means for studying these characteristics are discussed. A system is outlined for studying Kinescope resolution by breaking the picture into alternate black-and-white picture elements arranged in checkerboard fashion. A practical application of this system is described for a television system using a picture frame of approximately 340 lines repeated thirty times per second. The deflection and grid-signal frequencies that are involved are discussed. The problem of synchronizing these frequencies is covered and the circuits developed for this purpose are described. Some of the results obtained with these circuits are shown."
"The average brightness of typical outdoor scenes has been determined by computation and by measurement. The average brightness of some scenes was found to be over 1000 candles per square foot, and of other scenes nearly zero. In many cases the average brightness lay between twenty and 200 candles per square foot. The sensitivity of a present-day television system using the Iconoscope has been found to be sufficient to permit the transmission of pictures with good quality when the average brightness of an average scene was greater than about fifteen candles per square foot. This sensitivity is sufficient for the transmission of parades, races, baseball games, and many other outdoor events. Football games, which last until near sunset, cannot always be satisfactory reproduced. Some of the Iconoscopes used in these tests are of added sensitivity, which has been achieved by means of a silver evaporation process, as well as by careful control of the purity of the materials."
"Television pickup tubes which use cathode-ray beam scanning, although only one class of television pickup devices, may be made in a variety of ways, a number of which are described in this paper. In these tubes, the function of the electron beam is to release secondary electrons from the target, the number escaping being modulated by electrostatic fields, magnetic fields, orientation of electrodes or changes in the secondary emission ratio of the target. The Iconoscope is a well-known example of modulation by electrostatic fields produced by photoemission from the target. A conducting photocathode when used as a target, however, acted as if its secondary emission ratio were decreased by light. A copper plate oxidized and treated with caesium transmitted a picture with some time lag. Photoconductive materials exposed to light and scanned by an electron beam were made to develop potential variations over their surface and thereby transmit a television picture. Aluminum oxide and zirconium oxide, treated with caesium, were used in this manner. Selenium, used as a photoconductive material, also transmitted a picture. Germanium used as a target sensitive to heat radiation was able to transmit a picture, probably as a result of some thermoelectric effect. The most sensitive tubes tested were those in which an electron picture was focused upon a scanned, secondary electron emissive target. The scanning and picture projection operations may be separated by using a two-sided target. Coupling between the two sides was obtained by conducting plugs through the target."
"Field tests have shown the present standard Iconoscope to be a very satisfactory television pickup device. However, from a theoretical point of view the efficiency of the Iconoscope as a storage system is rather low. The principal factors responsible for the low efficiency are lack of collecting field for photoelectrons, and losses caused by the redistribution of secondary electrons produced by the beam. Limits to the sensitivity of the standard Iconoscope are set by the ratio of picture signal to amplifier and coupling resistor noise. Experimental and theoretical determinations indicate that an excellent picture can be transmitted with from two and one-half to six millilumens per square centimeter on the mosaic. Two methods are considered by which the sensitivity may be increased. The first is by the use of secondary emission signal multipliers and a low capacitance mosaic, while the second makes use of secondary emission image intensification. The sensitivity limits for the two cases are calculated."

"The Institute of Radio Engineers was formed in 1912 through the amalgamation of the Society of Wireless Telegraph Engineers and the Wireless Institute. Its headquarters were established in New York City and the membership has grown from less than fifty members at the start to almost six thousand by the end of 1932. The Institute functions solely to advance the theory and practice of radio and allied branches of engineering and of the related arts and sciences, their application to human needs, and the maintenance of a high professional standing among its members. Among the methods of accomplishing this need is the publication of papers, discussions, and communications of interest to the membership. The PROCEEDINGS is the official publication of the Institute and in it are published all of the papers, discussions, and communications received from the membership which are accepted for publication by the Board of Editors. Copies are sent without additional charge to all members of the Institute."

"Upon this, the Silver Anniversary of the Institute of Radio Engineers, it is appropriate to recall how there came into being the art of radiotelephony and, in turn, such services as overseas telephony and broadcasting. The Institute has seen the entire evolution within its relatively short life, with radiotelephony an unsolved problem in 1912 and today an accomplished fact of world-wide application. The pages of the Institute Proceedings testify to much of the building of the art, but nowhere has there been given a unified account of the structure as a whole and the relation of its technical substance to electric communications generally. To do this objectively and while the development is still fresh in mind is the purpose of the present paper. Naturally, the story is limited by space and by the information available to the writer. † Most of the account pertains to America. If the contributions of other countries are not adequately presented, it is because the limitations of time, space, and language have not yet been entirely overcome."
"Marking the tenth anniversary of the beginning of commercial long-distance radiotelephone service, the paper reviews: (1) Technical advances over the older radiotelegraph and short distance radiotelephone arts which made the initiation of long-distance service possible. These included water-cooled tubes, single-side-band suppressed-carrier transmission, and voice operated switching devices designed to prevent singing in combined wire and radiotelephone connections. (2) Engineering developments without which the growth of such services would have been severely restricted. The more important are short-wave transmission, accurate frequency stabilization, and privacy methods. (3) Certain further improvements of less uiniversal application. (4) Present outlook for future development. In most immediate prospect are the extensive application of single-side-band reduced carrrier in short-wave commercial operation and the commercial use of a new and improved method of receiving known as a multiple unit steerable antenna. The possibilities of applying grouped channel and multiplex methods to radio transmission are considered. The treatment is brief but comprehensive, being intended to interest the general engineering reader. A bibliography is attached."
"In considering the various methods used in making over-all acoustic measurements on radio receivers, from the standpoint of possible standardization, it was felt desirable to make a comparison of the results obtainable by the several principal methods now in use in this country. Accordingly a radio receiver was shipped successively to five different laboratories equipped to make such measurements. It was checked between each shipment by a sixth laboratory to guard against changes caused by the shipments. The test equipment setup and method used by each of the co-operating laboratories is described. The results obtained are discussed briefly and typical curves made by each laboratory are shown. The author has refrained from drawing any arbitrary conclusions regarding the relative accuracy or effectiveness of the various test methods employed by the cooperating laboratories. Instead, the comments, which the engineers of each laboratory cared to make on the curves obtained and the methods used, have been given. The reader is thus provided with data and a valuable series of comments from some of the most expert engineers in this field, from which he may arrive at his own conclusions. In general it is felt that the curves show a greater degree of similarity than might have been expected considering the rather fundamental differences in the test methods used, and that certain possibilities in the direction of useful standardization in this field have been indicated."
"Constantly increasing demand for synchronizing devices in telecommunication techniques has involved extended use of devices for the production of harmonics and subharmonics of an input master frequency. This article describes a new circuit for a generator by means of which frequency multiplication and division can be obtained The principle of feedback is applied in a new way to a valve circuit having a nonlinear response characteristic. The conditions for optimum output power are deduced and the advantages of the new circuit are discussed."

"Evidence is presented which indicates that, notwithstanding the change in sign made by Sommerfeld in his 1926 paper on radio wave propagation, the radiation field of a vertical electric dipole may be separated into space and surface wave components. Sommerfeld's original concepts as to the characteristics of two such waves in radio transmission are largely substantiated. It is shown that a space and a surface wave are generated by a simple vertical dipole antenna at the surface of the earth and that this surface wave has the same wave tilt as the Sommerfeld surface wave. Evidence is given which would indicate that this surface wave travels around the curve of the earth in much the same manner as a guided wire wave travels around a bend on a wire. In the appendix formulas are given for the space and surface waves in the radiation fields of a horizontal electric dipole and of horizontal and vertical magnetic dipoles."
"Completely general formulas are given for computing at any point above a plane earth of finite conductivity the vector electric field for a source which may be a combination of vertical and horizontal electric dipoles or a loop antenna with its axis parallel or perpendicular to the earth. As illustrations of the above general methods, formulas are derived for the ground-wave radiation from (1) a grounded vertical antenna carrying a sinusoidal current distribution and (2) elevated vertical and horizontal half-wave antennas. The \"effective height\" of the grounded vertical antenna is determined as a function of the ground constants, and this formula is then used to determine the effect of the ground constants on the groundwave field intensity in the neighborhood of a quarter-wave antenna. The formulas are also used to show the influence of antenna height on the attenuation of high and ultra-high frequencies. The forward tilt, i.e., Er/Ez, which occurs for the electric vector lying in the vertical plane passing through the antenna, is also easily computed from the formulas given and is shown graphically. An expression for the Poynting vector is derived, and it is shown that a part of the energy in the wave near the ground flows downward into the ground."

"An investigation of the effect of abrasion upon electrical brush wear is reported in this paper. Tests of the rate of wear of anode and cathode brushes, and of brushes carrying current and those that did not, show that abrasion is an important factor in electrical brush wear."
"To meet the need for lightning protection on low-voltage transmission lines at moderate cost, and particularly for wood-pole lines, a design is presented in this paper that has high insulation strength and uses, in place of a ground wire, a shielding phase conductor with a lightning protector tube. Lightning currents are drained to ground with a minimum number of tubes of low current rating."
"Early installations of 3-phase 4-wire power distribution systems of the multigrounded or common-neutral type in some cases created noise problems involving neighbouring telephone circuits. Operating experience, studies of specific situations and comprehensive co-operative research over a period of years have developed means of largely avoiding difficulties of this character. The relative importance of various features of the power and telephone systems which have been found to affect the noise-induction problems involved is discussed here, and the general co-operative procedures most helpful in conversions to, or extensions of, these types of power distribution systems, are outlined."
"An extension of the 2-reaction theory of synchronous machines as developed by R. H. Park is given in this paper for machines having capacitance in the armature circuit. General equations for predetermination of the performance under certain abnormal conditions of machines having balanced 3-phase capacitance in the aramture circuit are presented."
"During the past 2 years the AIEE transformer subcommittee* has proposed changes in the AIEE transformer standards; this paper is presented to bring these changes before the Institute."
"Accurate control of high currents for resistance welding may be obtained by igniter-type mercury-cathode tubes capable of conducting 7,000 amperes in impulses of from less than 0.01 second to several seconds duration. This paper describes design principles and manufacturing technique for tubes of the sealed-off type."
"In this paper the 2-reaction theory of synchronous machines is extended, for steady-state conditions, to present some new deductions apparently not previously known."
"In this paper a rigorous mathematical analysis of a synchronous machine with solid cylindrical rotor is presented. The analysis embodies a departure from the usual method of considering machine performance by means of circuit theory, and presents an attack from the point of view of field-distribution theory. Such an analysis is desirable, for it provides a definite means of considering the effect of eddy currents in the solid iron rotor."
"Effects of humidity, corona, and mechanical stress on the electrical characteristics of porcelain and glass suspension-insulator units are shown in this paper. Moisture, alone and combined with corona, is found to produce surface deposits which cause hysteresis effects in the power, power factor, and capacitive characteristics, and mechanical stress is found to reduce the power, power factor, and capacitance. The effect of stress is reduced where soft metal is used in place of cement in assembling the unit."
"In this paper data are presented on spark-over values of rod gaps, insulators, bushings, sphere gaps, and solid insulation for a range of spark-over times of approximately from 0.2 to 4 microseconds. The problems of accurate measurement that are involved are also discussed, and a shielded resistance voltage divider is described."
"Increased speed because of reduced inertia and greater torque is obtained from the polyphase directional relay described in this paper. A single cup-like moving element is used in place of multiple disks as used heretofore, the polyphase function being obtained by the use of multiple poles."
"Reclosure of circuit breakers following a fault on a high-voltage transmission line with a minimum of delay in order that synchronous load will not fall out of step is described in this paper. Apparatus that performs a complete operation in approximately 20 cycles on a 60-cycle system may be used to obtain a high degree of service continuity from a single-circuit transmission line."
"Poles are ordinarily considered as rigid struts in designing structures for supporting overhead lines, even in situations where they are not restrained by guys and it is known that movement takes place under variation in loading. This paper points out the importance of making allowance for this factor under certain conditions and gives the theory and practical methods for its solution."
"Continuing a series of papers reporting a study of lightning on transmission lines, the authors present herewith data obtained during 1935 and part of 1936 on 66-, 110-, 132-, and 220-kv lines. Values of lightning current are presented, and the effectiveness of overhead ground wires and low footing resistance in preventing tripouts is shown."
"This paper gives the results of experimental investigations relating to arc characteristics as they apply in commutator flashing. A knowledge of these characteristics is necessary for the application of the theory outlined in a previous paper1 on flashing of commutators by the same author, as well as for the investigation of flashing due to other causes."
"This paper provides a comparison of results of 5 economic studies* that were made to determine the economic relationship between conductor sizes and distribution transformer sizes for various load densities and rates of load growth. The progressive method of distribution design, which provides additions rather than replacements, has been found most economical. Increase in load density can be handled most economically by the subdivision of secondary mains and the installation of intermediate transformers. Numbers 4, 3, or 2 conductors and 15-kva transformers should be favored for overhead secondary distribution in residential areas in cities and towns. Rural lines and service to rural communities are not considered in this comparison."
"The results of a series of experiments, in which the processes of contact voltage drop and ring wear in sliding contact are demonstrated by means of a direct method, are presented in this paper. The results show that the wear of metalgraphite brushes and the rings upon which they operate can be reduced if they be operated in an oxygen-free gas instead of air."
"Bearings for the moving element in watt-hour meters have received considerable study in recent years in order that maintenance might be reduced. The requirements for the bearing, the materials available and their characteristics, lubricants, and the various designs of bearings are discussed in this paper."
"The provision of suitable overcurrent protection for distribution systems at low cost is an important problem, for upon the satisfactory solution of that problem depends the continuity of service of a great many consumers of electric energy; consequently, the relations of a public utility company with its customers also depend upon adequate overcurrent protection. This paper presents a discussion of the various trends in overcurrent protection, with the aim of providing for the distribution engineer some basis for selecting the particular protective system best suited to his particular requirements."
"The well-known expansion theorem of Heaviside applies to circuits whose current-electromotive force relations may be expressed through differential equations, whereas in some networks such as filters and artificial lines, in which the network consists of a repeated pattern or mesh, the relations give what are known as difference equations. These are equations involving the mesh number of the network. The solutions of such networks are given in this paper in the form of expansion theorems similar to Heaviside's expansion theorem and its extensions."
"The cleaning action upon gases of a corona discharge has been known since 1824, however, the technique of electrostatic precipitation has been improved slowly because of the inherent difficulties of the process and the somewhat limited field of its application. With accurately controlled industrial processes and delicate laboratory measurements came the necessary incentive for improving electrostatic precipitation equipment, and recently it has been applied in the field of medicine for the treatment of such maladies as hay fever. The theory of electrostatic precipitation is reviewed briefly in this paper, and a new precipitator is described."
"This paper presents a summary of the results of over 2,000 tests on the dielectric strength of transformer oil and insulating material for impulse, switching, and 60-cycle voltages. From these tests the voltage-time characteristics of the 2 insulations tested may be established over the entire range from a fraction of a microsecond to more than one minute."
"A comprehensive discussion of the factors affecting the performance of a watt-hour meter is presented in this paper, and the general discussion is applied to a description of the development of a new type of domestic watt-hour meter. Design and performance data on the new meter also are presented."
"Equipment capable of restoring service automatically after temporary interruptions on transmission and distribution systems has been developed to a high degree of effectiveness; however, most of such equipment is suitable only for systems of high capacity, and comparatively little attention has been given to systems of low and intermediate capacities. An automatic service restorer, designed primarily for use on systems of low capacity, is described in this paper, and some data on its operating characteristics are presented."
"It is suggested in this paper that impulse generator voltage waves for commercial testing may be compared not only on the basis of wave shape but also on the basis of relations between circuit constants. The charts and graphs included are intended to show how desirable this is, and they may be used to facilitate both front-of-wave and full-wave testing."

"What is the appropriate attitude for engineers to take toward economic problems, as individuals and through the AIEE? In response to a request from the Institute's publication committee, a noted engineer and educator here gives his answer to that question."
"1. The lightning-stroke effects on paper, tracing cloth, porcelain, Micarta, and photograph negatives indicate an area (circular) for the core proportional to the current in the lightning discharge. This apparent area is, respectively, 0.08, 0.16, and 0.24 square inch for currents of 25,000, 50,000, and 75,000 amperes. Tests on fiber tubes at 140,000 amperes indicate an area of 0.44 square inch. 2. The surface fusion on copper plates, the photograph negatives, the glaze burning on porcelain, the record on Micarta, and other effects all show that the core is sustained the greater part of or the whole duration of the lightning-current discharge. The center part, some two-thirds or one-half, of the above-mentioned area comprises the core proper where the temperature is highest and maintained longer. Some expansion or variation in the core proper takes place during the discharge apparently resulting in the larger area. The actual current in the discharge (electrons for the greater part) naturally occupies but a fractional part of the core. The above records and observation suggest that the core structure is a complex of parts and processes. 3. When or as the current ceases the core then expands abruptly or explodes into the column. The expansion appears from the records relatively uniform (circular), the gases suffering a corresponding temperature drop with expansion. The later stages of the expansion process become turbulent in character. Thus for a current discharge of 50,000 amperes, uniform expansion apparently extends some one to 2 inches in diameter."
"This is a study of the current, voltage, and power values throughout a simple transmission system when machines are operating out of step. The investigation was made to determine the proper relay protection for some large frequency changers which supply power to an electrified railroad. The object was to find means for protecting machines that had already fallen out of step or, if possible, to prevent them from falling out due to overload. The treatment of the problem is geometric, probably the easiest method to comprehend. The assumed conditions have been kept as simple as possible, but it is hoped that the method of treatment is complete enough to permit anyone interested in the subject easily to apply it to more complex problems. It is to be particularly observed that the common method of assuming that a system consists of pure reactance leads to errors that are noticeable on 25-cycle systems where the reactance is low. As a by-product of the study of machine protection, it was discovered that the behavior of different types of line-sectionalizing relays under out-of-step conditions can be easily predetermined and proper adjustments made to obtain a more desirable performance of such relays."
"Two test methods for the determination of stray load losses in d-c machines are described. Application of the loading-back principle permits measurements to a high degree of accuracy. A technique is developed for stabilizing no-load losses so that consistency of results is improved. Results of tests of several machines are presented, together with an analysis of the relation of loss to operating conditions of the machine."

This outline of some of the elementary notions regarding electrostatics and the dielectric circuit is presented here because of its possible interest and value to students and others wishing to review the subject with the aim of attaining a working knowledge of it."
"Improvements in the transmitter and receiver, instruments basic to the telephone art, continually have led to a higher grade of service and further economies. Research work has made possible predetermination of performance by calculation; the effect of studies of speech sounds, hearing, materials, and testing methods on the development of instruments giving high quality for conversation is shown by this article, which is based on one of three Iwadare lectures* delivered in 1937."

Comparisons may be drawn among professional classes, ages, and educational background."
"This paper describes the operation of a modern trolley coach system. This system was installed one year ago with a single line and a few coaches. Now there are 7 lines in operation, the total route lengths exceeding 45 miles and requiring 40 coaches, each of which has a seating capacity of forty persons. The paper is generally divided into 2 parts, the first dealing with descriptions of the system and equipment, and the second part setting forth such experiences as have been gained in one year of operation."
"This article describes a method of measuring strayload losses which is readily adaptable to the test departments of the manufacturers.

"This educational paper presents fundamental concepts of synchronous machine reactances in a form suitable for college seniors and recent graduates. Part I builds up the ``physical concepts'' of flux linkage and inductance, part II applies the concepts to synchronous machines, developing a physical picture of machine reactances. Part III starts with the fundamental circuit differential equations of a machine and obtains expressions for the reactances in terms of self- and mutual inductances, ending with the machine equations in the direct, quadrature, and zero axes, which give a physical picture of the machine ``viewed'' from these axes."
"This paper discusses the use of per-unit quantities and their relation to dimensional analysis. It has been written at the request of the committee on education, and designed primarily for those interested in education, to serve as a background for discussion of the need which has arisen in the electrical engineering literature to translate new techniques into language readily understandable by students. The use of per-unit quantities in the current machinery literature, although invaluable to the practicing engineer who wishes to obtain as much similarity as possible in calculations of machines and transformers of various ratings, is confusing to the average student, largely because factors which have physical significance are divided out and dimensions which would aid him in recognizing the origin of the different terms in an equation disappear."

The plan of the power plant and the switchboards and control equipment are described in this paper."
"Control of water level according to a predetermined cycle and its automatic recording in a model of the Cape Cod Canal have been accomplished by electrical means which depend for operation upon the capacitances between the surface of the water and metal plates suspended above the water. The theory of operation and the apparatus are described in this paper."
"Data pertaining to lightning currents actually measured in tower structures, counterpoises, and ground wires on 132-kv lines during 1933-36 are presented in this paper. It is concluded that stroke currents rarely exceed 150,000 amperes, although 220,000 amperes has been indicated, and that currents as high as 60,000 amperes measured in the overhead ground wires indicate the necessity of adequate shielding of the line at station entrances."
"A method of recording, by means of an oscillograph, the eddy currents in various parts of the cross section of a squirrel-cage-rotor bar is presented in this paper. From such records the magnitude of the power loss caused by eddy currents, and its variation with load, may be determined. A series of tests of this nature has been made; the results, which the author believes to be correct in general, show that the change of eddy-current loss with load is negligible, thus simplifying the determination of the composite stray-load loss of a squirrel-cage induction motor."
"Use of image conductors in iron, of Rayleigh insulating partitions, and of images of conductors in these partitions is shown in this paper to afford one possible line of attack on the problem of the reactance of the end connections of electrical machinery. The use of 2 other methods to reduce the field in the end zone to a basis where Ampere's equation may be correctly applied is also suggested."
"The AIEE subcommittee on interconnection and stability factors* presents herein the first comprehensive review by an AIEE committee of the subject of stability, or successful parallel operation of a-c machines transmitting large blocks of power without loss of synchronism. A summary of principal installations made during the past 10 years which gives data on the various stability measures employed and a comprehensive bibliography are included."

"The application of technical advances to the welfare of mankind is held to be the true contribution of engineering to civilization, rather than the advances themselves; power together with tools to use it, and not power alone, led to American Industrial development. More than merely the availability of large amounts of power is necessary in order that standards of living ma be raised, and maintained."
"Higher armature peripheral speeds, better insulation, and improved ventilation of railway motors, together with the rapid development of Diesel-electric equipment for railroads, have made necessary a revision of the AIEE Standards for Railway Motors. The new standards have been adopted as ``American Tentative Standards'' pending further experience with the new types of machinery covered by them."
"A brief review of the fundamentals of the lightning protection problem, and of the various common methods of protecting power transmission lines against lightning, their comparative merits, and their relative costs."
"In this paper the carbon arc is considered in its 3 characteristic forms, the low intensity arc, the high intensity arc, and the flame arc. The influence of arc current on the energy emission is discussed in relation to each of the 3 types, as well as the effects of variation in arc voltage. The discussion covers characteristics which should be given consideration in order to make most effective application of the various types of arcs."
"This paper is the first of 2 papers dealing with the development of equations for determining the characteristic constants of single-phase induction motors. It is intended to present in the complete paper a unified tabulation of formulas consistent in symbols with those used in the paper which I presented at the midwinter convention of the AIEE, New York, January 28-February 1, 1929. This particular section of the paper deals with a rigorous development of the reactances of single-phase motors which result from fluxes crossing the air gap between the stator and rotor."
"THE analysis of circuits containing copper-oxide rectifiers is based upon the selection of a proper representation of the variable impedance of the rectifier element. In this analysis, the element is replaced by 2 constant resistances effective during the 2 directions of current flow through the rectifier. On the basis of this representation, an equivalent circuit is developed, which is a modification of the usual perfect rectifier circuit. The method is illustrated by analyzing circuits in which the loads consist of resistance and inductance and of resistance and capacitance. The computed results are then compared with observations made by an oscillograph."

"Because it is considered to be timely, informative, and lucid, this article is republished* here so that the many members of the Institute who are interested in, but not intimately associated with, the field of engineering education may have the benefit of a reflection of current practices and trends in engineering education as seen by a recognized authority in that field."
"THE RESULTS of an extensive oscillographic study of power-system faults to ground are presented herewith. While this study was made primarily to obtain data useful in inductive co-ordination problems, the results are believed to be of general interest as well. They provide data on such items as frequency of occurence of ground-current disturbances, their monthly distribution, duration, cause, method of clearance, and wave-trace characteristics. Data on fault resistance are given in part II, a companion paper."
"AN ALLOWANCE for fault resistance in fault current computations is desirable in certain types of problems. The present paper gives the results of a study made to determine reasonable values of fault resistance to use in computing line-to-ground fault currents, particularly in inductive co-ordination studies. The sources and nature of the data used in the study are described in a companion paper."
"THE MEASUREMENT of magnetic fields in air gaps by the existing methods, is almost as cumbersome as light measurements were before the introduction of the photronic cell or photoelectric tube into that field. This paper describes a meter for the measurement of magnetic flux which seems to parallel the advance made in the lighting field."
"IN VIEW of the frequent criticism of engineers to the effect that they do not pay sufficient attention to economic and business factors, a brief review of the present activities of engineers is given. It is pointed out that they are extensively and successfully handling economic problems relating directly to their specific line of work but that they are inclined to overlook other economic and business factors equally important but somewhat removed from their daily tasks. In order to stimulate the interest of the younger engineers in economics and to give them a broader viewpoint of the business enterprises in which they will be engaged, a brief but fairly comprehensive course on ``industrial economics and business methods'' is advocated to be given in preference to some of the highly specialized technical courses now forming part of the undergraduate curricula. The paper outlines the type of subjects which seem suitable for this course and further recommends that analytical methods of attack be employed to a greater extent than is now customary in economic studies."

"The advance of engineering has a vital bearing upon economic progress; in turn, though perhaps less obviously, the operation of the economic system largely determines the rate at which new engineering discoveries may be applied in the actual production of wealth. From this point of view Doctor Moulton discussed progress in the interdependent fields of engineering and economics in the Eleventh Steinmetz Memorial Lecture,* full text of which is presented here."
"Getting more power from less fuel, and consequently providing the public with a dependable supply of electric power at low rates, is the goal toward which power engineers have aimed for many years. In striving toward this goal, they have made significant contributions to society, some of which are indicated in this article"
"Between 1930 and 1934 there was a substantial net loss of employment among those engineers in the United States who entered the profession before 1930, and a considerable absorption in employment of newcomers to the profession. This is one important conclusion reached by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor after analyzing reports from 52,589 professional engineers obtained in the 1935 survey of the engineering profession conducted by the Bureau at the request and with the co-operation of American Engineering Council. This article,* third in the series reporting the results of this survey, presents data pertaining to the employment of engineers during 1929-34."
"The history and development of police radiocommunication is discussed and an outline given of the federal regulations under which this type of service is rendered together with reasons therefor. The problems arising in the selection of equipment and during the installation and operation of police radio systems are discussed. The methods of operation of the various classes of police radio services are described. The various uses of radio covered by this paper are: 1. By municipalities for one-way communication to mobile units and remote police stations 2. By municipalities for 2-way communication with mobile units 3. By status in the general dispatching of state police units 4. By states and municipalities for the ratiotelegraphic exchange of police information 5. By harbor police in connection with the dispatching of harbor police boats and general policing of shipping 6. By states for emergency radiotelegraphic use in the event of interruption of the wire teletype network"
"It is difficult to find a mathematical formula which will fully agree with observed data on corona loss under all conditions. Therefore, a purely empirical method of corona loss calculation has been developed, based on analysis and co-ordination of the experimental data which have been accumulated at Stanford University."
"The results of tests made on 9 viscous mineral oils of various types and on mixtures of these oils with 8 resins are presented. The physical and electrical properties, stability to oxidation, and stability to gaseous ionization are correlated with the viscosity index and chemical composition of the oils and resins. The catalytic effects of metals on oil oxidation are studied. Gaseous ionization in insulation voids is found to exert a physical pressure and to accelerate saturant oxidation."
"An investigation of motor protection can be made by a comparison of the proper motor and thermal overload relay data. Convenient data for this are motor ``protection'' curves for comparison with ``tripping time'' curves of thermal overload relays. These motor curves should include single phase operation of polyphase motors as this is one of the abnormal conditions for which motors should be protected. The capacity of the motor at different expected ambient temperatures should be compared with the capacity of the overload relay at its corresponding ambient temperatures."
"1. Ultraviolet radiation of the spheres materially improved the consistency of the sphere gap. 2. As compared with the nonirradiated gap the spark-over spacing of the irradiated gap was slightly but definitely increased over the whole range. 3. The curve of the nonirradiated gap checks the calibration as given in AIEE Standards No. 4 up to approximately 300 kv but falls below standard curve above this point. 4. The vacuum-tube type crest voltmeter used in conjunction with a capacitance potential divider was found to be very satisfactory and convenient both for calibrating the sphere gap and for everyday measurements of 60-cycle crest voltages."
"Based on the observed phenomenon that flashover of transmission-line towers provided with 2 overhead ground wires occurs only when the product of tower footing resistance and tower surge current exceeds the insulation strength, the probable outages that will occur on a line can be obtained by a simple method. Only those factors enter into the calculations which have become generally accepted quantitatively. Computations have been made for 3 transmission lines and the results compared with operating records. The agreement has been very good."

"Data obtained from 35,559 engineers by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics in its survey of the engineering profession indicate that the degree of economic security among professional engineers, as evidenced by possession of an employment contract covering some period of time, or by pension privileges, was negligible. This is the fourth* in a series of articles reporting the results of the Bureau's survey."
"Use of ultrahigh frequencies for educational broadcasting has been thought to offer attractive possibilities because of the supposedly almost unlimited number of channels; however, the demands of other radio services, particularly television, may be expected to congest this newly opened region. Ultrahigh-frequency waves behave somewhat like light waves, and give reliable and steady communication over short distances. The 6-megacycle band width required for television can be accommodated only in this region, but short range precludes, for the present, coverage of rural areas with these frequencies."
"To give the radiobroadcast listener maximum service is an important problem in which the frequencies available, characteristics of the receiving set, phenomena of transmission of radio waves, area to be served, and density of population in the area must be considered. Broadcast stations in the United States are of 2 main classes, clear channel and duplicated channel, and are allocated in frequency to prevent interference between stations in the same area. Short-wave braodcasting has additional limitations because of natural phenomena."
"The development of synthetic noninflammable chlorinated liquids of the aromatic hydrocarbon type places in the hands of the engineer a chemically stable material of high dielectric strength and possessing a dielectric constant approximately equal in value to that of cellulose itself. This insures a more equitable stress distribution in the composite insulation assembly normally used in commercial practice. The result is an increase in dielectric breakdown and related phenomena. No fixed relation defining the superiority of the synthetic noninflammable liquid or liquid-treated insulation is possible, since variation in test conditions changes the relative dielectric values. In general, however, the data indicate an advantage in favor of the synthetic liquid and liquid-treated insulation equal to at least 20 per cent of the corresponding mineral-oil value."
"A quantitative investigation of the surge protective requirements of distribution systems and the power frequency voltage requirements of protectors for these systems, has been made which leads to the conclusions that: 1. The surge current discharge capacity of protectors should be 100,000 amperes to prevent damage from lightning. In general, 50,000 amperes capacity will give satisfactory results. 2. The surge voltage breakdown characteristics should be similar in shape and lower in value than the transformer insulation. 3. Field experience, as well as laboratory tests, have proved that a high degree of protection is obtained with a ratio of protective device initial discharge voltage to normal frequency voltage of 9 to 1 in voltage classes up to 13.8 kv, compared to the present conventional arrester rates up to 3.5 to 1. 4. Testing of protective devices under conditions more nearly representative of their service requirements should be considered."
"This paper presents, from the viewpoint of the engineer who plans and operates electric power systems, the application logic or theory and the performance results with various forms of spill gaps, for the protection of circuits and equipment from lightning, and the selection of insulation levels co-ordinated with this type of protection. The performance results are largely confined to transmission voltages, although the same general principles and logic apply over the entire transmission and distribution operating voltage range."
"A general-purpose wide-range high-precision vibration-measuring instrument must embody several fundamental design requirements which determine the useful frequency range, the accuracy of measurement, the intensity of vibration to which it can be applied, and the effect of the instrument on the vibrating body. In this paper the advantages and disadvantages of certain mechanical and electrical detecting and amplifying systems for the measurement of vibration amplitude, velocity, and acceleration, are discussed in the light of their design requirements. A vibration generator capable of producing sinusoidal vibrations over a wide frequency and amplitude range, and a set of vibration standards with which the vibrations produced can be accurately determined, are also described. In conclusion, criteria for evaluating the performance of vibration measuring instruments of different types are suggested."
"A historical review of advances in the design of highspeed cathode-ray oscillographs and in particular a description of the development, performance, and application of a new type oscillograph is presented in this paper. The new instrument embodies a sealed-glass, high-vacuum, hot-cathode, cathode-ray tube for operation at 15,000 volts."

"With the January 1937 issue, ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING presented to its readers the ``easy reading'' page. This article presents a discussion of the factors that would influence the production of a perfect reading page, and an opinion, founded upon scientific research, concerning this ``easy reading'' page as an approximation of the theoretical ideal."
"The mounting structure for the 200-inch telescope being built on Mt. Palomar, in Southern California, USA, will consist of electric-arc-welded units. The mounting for the telescope will consist of 2 parts: a tube, and a cradle or yoke which will carry the tube. The tube, which will serve as the supporting structure for the principal optical elements, will rotate about 2 ball-bearing trunnions supported in a horseshoes-shaped yoke. The decision to use arc welding so extensively in the construction of the tube and mounting is considered an outstanding example of the engineer's confidence in the welding art. Most of the material being used for the tube and mounting is quite ordinary mild carbon steel, except for very few pieces made of special alloys that have low expansivity. All the materials being welded are of standard commercial grades - an important practical consideration. Arc welding only is being employed, and heavily coated electrodes of the mineral-coating or slag-producing type are being used. Overhead welding has been avoided. The electrodes are of such nature that they are equally satisfactory with either dc or ac welding ap paratus. Both are being used throughout; ac welding was found to be especially useful for welding into comers. All welding on the tube parts and to date on the \"horse shoe\" has been manual welding. All the parts are being carefully annealed to relieve internal stresses. As an example of the accu racy with which the parts were held to size throughout welding and annealing, when the prime-focus cage was placed on the boring mill to face the lower end where it bolts to the top ring of the tube, the departure from roundness was not greater than 1/16 inch."
"This paper presents a comprehensive method of determining the performance of distance relays along the lines indicated above which may be summarized as follows: 1. A general method by which the performance of any of the types of distance elements in common use may be determined from the effective impedance presented to the element. 2. A tabulation from which the effective impedance presented to any type of distance element under any condition of fault may be obtained in terms of the effective line impedance between the relay and the fault and 4 quantities which are characteristic of the system setup and location of the fault with reference to the relay. These quantities may be determined approximately by the use of a d-c calculating table setup. 3. A method for including the effect of fault resistance in the determination of the effective impedance presented to the relay. 4. Methods by which the performance of standard directional elements under fault conditions may be determined. 5. An extension of the general method to enable the expression of the operating time of CZ relays in terms of the effective impedance presented to the relay. 6. An extension of the general method to include the performance of distance relays connected for protection against single-phase-to-ground faults."
"In 1934 tests were started to investigate the important factors influencing the life of oil-impregnated paper at high voltage. Last year we described the techniques developed to date in this investigation. The present paper presents all data taken on specimens tested under a gas pressure of 200 pounds per square inch and compared all results obtained with one commercial mineral oil and one commercial wood-pulp paper for 3 conditions of gas pressure. The results indicate that under the conditions of these tests there is no correlation between dielectric loss and electrical life and that gas-free specimens are superior to any specimens saturated with gas up to 200 pounds per square inch pressure."
"In order to make possible the prediction of the attenuation and distortion of lightning waves on transmission lines an equation is proposed that relates the change of shape of a traveling wave to the corona loss on the line at normal operating frequency. Results obtained by computation from this formula are compared with experimental results of various investigators."

"Whether democracy in America can endure depends in no small measure upon the attitude of the great professional classes in general, and in particular upon the attitude and effectiveness of the engineer in his relation to government, says this well-known engineer and educator, who states further that although there is an enormously complex system of organizations of scientists and engineers in the United States, this mechanism is not utilized to the full in expressing the viewpoints of engineers generally upon important public questions. To meet this need, Doctor Bush suggests that the organization of engineers should be integrated, simplified, and strengthened."
"What can and should engineers do about the social and economic problems that beset the modern world? In answering this question, Doctor Flanders says: ``We must exercise our responsibility more for the sake of society as a whole than for the sake of ourselves as individual engineers or for the private interests of the businesses with which we may be connected.'' He states further that: ``It is an inescapable duty that we each make of ourselves centers of education and influence, to the end that our useful offices may continue, and our civilization fulfill its destiny of an ever-growing service to the needs of mankind.''"
"Recognition of outstanding young American electrical engineers by Eta Kappa Nu, honorary electrical engineering society, began with the presentation of awards for 1936. The society expects its plan of annual awards to incite a fuller and broader professional development of young electrical engineers. Statistics for the men nominated for the 1936 awards are presented and discussed in this article."
"Unit heaters of the industrial type have been applied for external cooling of transformers and found to be especially useful as a substitute for the original water cooling system or as a supplement to the regular cooling system. Portable substations of smaller size and reduced weight were made possible by the use of these units."
"Surface units of electric ranges have various efficiencies of heat transfer according to the design of the unit. Results of a study made with bright- and black-bottomed utensils are reported in this prize-winning student paper."
"This paper undertakes to state briefly the plans of organization of the Ontario Hydro-Electric Commission, the British Grid, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and then the proposals made by the planning bodies and in bills submitted to Congress for the public administration of power from Bonneville and Grand Coulee. (I have not received Senate Bill No. 2092, and H. R. 6151, a bill prepared by the Senators of Oregon and Washington, which is more similar, I suspect, to their bill described herein which died with the 74th Congress. I would have been glad to add a summary of this bill if time had permitted.)"
"A harmonic generator circuit is described which produces a number of harmonics simultaneously at substantially uniform amplitudes by means of a nonlinear coil. Generators of this type have been used for the supply of carrier currents to multichannel telephone systems, for the synchronization of carrier frequencies in radio transmitters, and for frequency comparison and standardization. A simple physical picture of the action of the circuit has been derived from an approximate mathematical analysis. The principal roles of the nonlinear coil may be regarded as fixing the amount of charge, and timing the charge and discharge of a condenser in series with the resistance load. By suitably proportioning the capacity, load resistance, and saturation inductance of the nonlinear coil, the amplitudes of the harmonics may be made to approximate uniformity over a wide frequency range. The sharply peaked current pulse developed by condenser discharge passes through the nonlinear coil in its saturated state and so contributes nothing to the eddy-current loss in the core. In this way the efficiency of frequency transformation is maintained at a comparatively high value for the harmonics in a wide frequency band, even with small core structures. The theory has also been adequate in establishing a basis for design, and in evaluating the effects of extraneous input components."
"Radiation resistance, although ordinarily neglected, is actually of dominant importance in determining the selectivity factor Q and the input impedance Zs for both parallel-wire and concentric lines at high radio frequencies, and therefore materially changes the optimum design of the line, whether used as a low-loss inductive or capacitive reactance or to give high selectivity or high impedance as a resonant line. Accurate design equations for maximum selectivity and for maximum impedance are developed in this paper for both parallel-wire and concentric lines, and curves are included showing radiation resistance, selectivity, input impedance, optimum values of spacing, conductor radius, etc. It is shown that for maximum Q the optimum ratio of spacing to wire radius for parallel-wire lines is D/r = 6.186, and the ratio of outer conductor radius to inner conductor radius for concentric lines is b/a = 4.22, as compared with values of about 3.6 for both ratios when radiation resistance is neglected. For maximum impedance corresponding values are D/r = 20.96 and b/a = 14.3, as compared with values of 8 and 9.2, respectively, predicted neglecting radiation resistance. Moreover, Q and Zs are not proportional to D and b, as indicated in previous analyses; instead definite values of D and b give maximum Q and slightly larger values give maximum Zs, and even a small departure from the best value produces a large decrease in Q or in Zs."
"The vodas is used in radiotelephony to switch the voice paths rapidly to and fro, and thus prevent echoes and singing that would otherwise occur at unpredictable times. It is also used to save privacy apparatus by permitting the use of the same apparatus for both directions of transmission. The performance characteristics of the electromagnetic relays used in the vodas are very suitable in that they have small operating and constant releasing times. Improved performance of the voice-operated relays in the presence of line noise can be secured by the use of a syllabic type of vodas which discriminates between the characteristic voltage-time envelopes of the noise and speech waves. Laboratory and field tests indicate that this device even without delay circuits, gives slightly better performance on most conditions than the original vodas with delay. When provided with a transmitting delay circuit, the syllabic device is decidedly better than the older vodas."

"Six factors influence the result of an electric shock: type of circuit, voltage, resistance, current, current pathway, and duration of contact. Preventive measures will reduce the hazard, and resuscitation will save many victims, according to information summarized in this article, which is based on reports previously published."
"In this, the fifth article1 of a series reporting a survey of employment in the engineering profession by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, income data for engineers of various professional classes and ages are presented, based on information given for the years 1929, 1932, and 1934. Comparisons may be drawn among professional classes, ages, and educational backgrounds."
"Approximately one tenth of the investment in the American steel industry is in electrical plant. The power consumption of steel mills is increasing. About two thirds of the power used is generated within the plants but there is a trend toward increased purchase of power. Electricity is gaining a foothold in the field of transportation through the Diesel-electric locomotive. D-c motors are being used more for main-roll drives. Synchronous motors are also gaining favor. Reversing drives have developed interesting ramifications. There is a trend toward subdivision of main roll drives. The combination of reduction gears and mill pinions into a single unit is of interest. The use of new types of bearings affects power requirements. The concentration of d-c power associated with the main-roll drives of wide strip mills has introduced problems concerning interrupting capacity of circuit breakers and strength of bus installations. In the field of auxiliary drives, the increased application of small individual induction motors is notable. Electrical precipitation finds greater acceptance in the field of gas cleaning. Electric melting furnaces supply a small but growing increment of total steel production. High-frequency heating is finding some uses. New types of electric furnaces are being installed for heat treating and annealing operations."
"The problem of correcting temperature errors in electrical instruments with copper windings is explained and the high electrical efficiency obtainable by correcting these errors with series resistors having negative temperature coefficients of resistance is noted. A method is described for making such resistors of tellurium and of silver-tellurium alloy. Tests at various loads are described as a result of which the suitability of these resistors for various applications is determined."
"This paper discusses several factors which have not been included in the previously published regulation formulas and which should be considered in the practical application of rectifiers. Approximate solutions are given to take system reactance, and the load inductance into account. The effect of grid pickup characteristics on regulation, and means of modifying the inherent regulation characteristics by regulators or compensators are discussed."
"Operating speeds of 350 or more welds per minute are made practical with a new type of control equipment for pneumatically operated portable welding tools."
"Starting with R. H. Park's formulas for the flux linkages of an ideal synchronous machine, the case of a fault from 2 line terminals of a generator to neutral is treated in a manner similar to that used by Doherty and Nickle for other unsymmetrical faults. Expressions are given for the armature currents in the faulted phases and for the main field current, at any time after the short circuit. An expression for the voltage across the open phase a short time after the fault is also developed."
"Widely different types of earth structure were indicated by the a-c coupling measurements at the 3 locations where these tests were performed, and by the behavior of the transient induced voltages. The departures of the measured transient voltages from the values which would have occurred with a uniform earth resistivity could generally be correlated satisfactorily with the measured a-c coupling. At Savannah, Ga., a value of 100 meter-ohms was found to give about the best over-all agreement between the measured transient voltages and the voltages computed on the basis of uniform earth resistivity, this value being a reasonable one to choose from the standpoint of the measured a-c coupling. The voltages computed for this uniform resistivity were considerably lower than the measured voltages at the closest separation and, with increasing separation, the computed voltages gradually increased in comparison with the measured voltages, until at the widest separation they were substantially higher than the latter. At Macon, Ga., the earth structure was apparently highly irregular, but with a reasonable value of uniform earth resistivity, 500 meter-ohms, as indicated by the a-c coupling measurements, the maximum values of the computed transient voltages agreed roughly with the maximum values of the measured voltages. However, these computed voltages increased more rapidly than did the measured voltages, subsequent to the beginning of the transient, and decreased more rapidly after the maximum values were attained."
"The problems associated with brush application on commutating-type equipment in the iron and steel industry are discussed in relation to type of equipment and conditions encountered in service. The paper also discusses a newly defined measure of brush performance, termed ``commutation factor,'' which provides an improved basis for control of the performance characteristics of brushes. Mention is made of the development of electrographitic grades having mild polishing action, designed to prevent the formation of troublesome surface film on commutators exposed to the contaminating atmospheric conditions frequently encountered in steel mill applications."
"The results of a study of the resistance of small single-layer inductances for use at frequencies between 4 and 25 megacycles are given. From experimental and analytical work a procedure has been deduced for the optimum design of such inductances."
"IT IS THE purpose of this paper to develop in a concise and simple manner the theory of matrix algebra from the foundations, and to emphasize the use of this powerful method in engineering problems. It appears not to be a well-known fact among engineers that the matrix is not only a convenient notation that summarizes in a natural and convenient form whole groups of operations but that it is actually possible to solve the sets of differential or algebraic equations written in matrix form in a most convenient manner. The method by which this is done is one of the utmost simplicity but makes use of some fundamental theorems on matrices not usually found in texts. The theory is scattered throughout the mathematical literature. It has, therefore, been considered worth while in the interest of unity and simplicity to build the subject from the foundations. It thus requires no previous knowledge of matrix algebra for the understanding of this paper. The recent work of Kron, Sah, and others using the notation of tensors and dyadics in studying the behavior of circuits and machinery suggests the power and flexibility of more advanced mathematical methods in expressing the behavior of physical systems. A perusal of this paper will illustrate that the matrix appears to be a natural tool to employ in the solution of certain classes of problems."

"Coupling Between Earth-Return Circuits. Induced voltages recorded in communication circuits paralleling d-c electric railways, at times of short circuit on the railway, have shown marked divergencies from computed values. Because of the numerous factors that might contribute to these divergencies, experimental studies of the transient coupling between parallel earth-return circuits, free from the effects of shielding conductors, and with concentrated rather than distributed grounds, have been made in order to provide a better understanding of the problem (pages 1159–64)."

"PREPARED under the auspices of the subcommittee on sound∗ of the AIEE standards committee, this preliminary report is intended to provide some basis for standardized technique in the relatively new field of apparatus noise measurement. Because of the newness of apparatus noise investigations, and the importance of the subject, the subcommittee anticipates some possible inadequacies in this report, and solicits criticisms and comments from readers. To facilitate specific discussions, paragraphs are numbered."
"I INTEREST in co-operation among different engineering groups and the need for an agency to provide, on behalf of our profession, tangible service to public agencies, prompted, in 1920, the organization of the American Engineering Council with Herbert Hoover, then Secretary of Commerce, as its first president. From its very beginning it has been an organization of organizations intended to aid the engineering profession in presenting a united front in matters of interest to our government and to the public. While the Founder and other major engineering societies have been aiding in professional development of the engineer, the American Engineering Council has been supplementing their efforts by relating the engineering profession to public welfare and by making our government, as well as the public at large, conscious of the value of the engineers' services and contributions. It has served during the past 16 years as a clearing house for questions of public nature which require technological knowledge and engineering experience, and it has acted as an advisory body for the various engineering societies in connection with problems of government. At the same time the American Engineering Council has been an agency of inquiry into economic and social problems as affected by technology."
"IN CONSIDERING this subject a clear, concise, definite, and comprehensive conception of an engineer is essential. The dictionary definition “one versed in or practicing any branch of engineering,” does not meet the requirements. Several practicing engineers submitted definitions, the most amusing of which was, “an engineer is a man who can do with one dollar what any man can do with 2 dollars.” An engineer's wife felt that “an engineer is one with whom it is rather difficult to live but quite impossible to live without.” Of the definitions submitted, the following was the best: “an engineer is one who through training, study, and practice successfully adapts and controls the materials and forces of nature to the benefit and advantage of himself, his fellow engineers, and the rest of the human family.” This is quite similar to that prepared by the American Engineering Council, “engineering is the science of controlling the forces and utilizing the materials of nature for the benefit of man and the art of organizing and directing human activities therewith.”"
"In this, the fifth article1 of a series reporting a survey of employment in the engineering profession by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, income data for engineers of various professional classes and ages are presented, based on information given for the years 1929, 1932, and 1934. Comparisons may be drawn among professional classes, ages, and educational backgrounds."
"THE RAPIDLY increasing demand for flat-rolled sheet steel and strip products has made necessary the application of electrical apparatus to modern developments in rolling-mill machinery and caused the rapid construction of many wide continuous hot- and cold-strip mills in every section of the country. A comprehensive picture of a strip mill, and the application of electricity to the production of sheet steel can be seen in Bethlehem Steel Company's hot- and cold-strip mill."
"Approximately one tenth of the investment in the American steel industry is in electrical plant. The power consumption of steel mills is increasing. About two thirds of the power used is generated within the plants but there is a trend toward increased purchase of power."
"R.H. PARK1, 2, 3 has presented a general analysis of salient-pole synchronous machines∗ in terms of direct, quadrature, and zero axis quantities. This analysis is very well adapted to the case of a machine with balanced series inductance and resistance in the armature circuit, but requires modification for any other terminal impedance. S. B. Crary4 has recently extended the method of Park to include the effects of balanced armature circuit capacitance. In the present paper the same method of analysis is further extended to include the effects of any balanced impedance network connected to the armature terminals. Every concept (impedance operators, per-unit quantities, d and q axis quantities, etc.) of the previous synchronous machine theory is preserved unchanged in this extended theory, and every problem solvable by the previous theory is now susceptible to an exactly similar solution in the extended case. Such problems are, e.g.: 3-phase short circuit, sudden application or change of load, self-excitation, asynchronous operation, hunting, pulling into step, any prescribed change of field or armature voltage, torque under any of the conditions given above."
"The problem of correcting temperature errors in electrical instruments with copper windings is explained and the high electrical efficiency obtainable by correcting these errors with series resistors having negative temperature coefficients of resistance is noted. A method is described for making such resistors of tellurium and of silver-tellurium alloy. Tests at various loads are described as a result of which the suitability of these resistors for various applications is determined."
"This paper discusses several factors which have not been included in the previously published regulation formulas and which should be considered in the practical application of rectifiers. Approximate solutions are given to take system reactance, and the load inductance into account. The effect of grid pickup characteristics on regulation, and means of modifying the inherent regulation characteristics by regulators or compensators are discussed."
"THE COLD rolling of steel strip on tandem mills requires the measurement and control of tension in the strip, and to meet this requirement the tensiometer herein described has been developed. The tensiometer produces a continuous indication of the tension in the strip during the rolling operation, and functions in connection with auxiliary control equipment to automatically maintain the tension at any desired value. An additional function of the tensiometer is the instantaneous indication of any difference in tension between the 2 edges of the strip."
"Operating speeds of 350 or more welds per minute are made practical with a new type of control equipment for pneumatically operated portable welding tools."
"Starting with R. H. Park's formulas for the flux linkages of an ideal synchronous machine, the case of a fault from 2 line terminals of a generator to neutral is treated in a manner similar to that used by Doherty and Nickle for other unsymmetrical faults. Expressions are given for the armature currents in the faulted phases and for the main field current, at any time after the short circuit. An expression for the voltage across the open phase a short time after the fault is also developed."
"SO MUCH has been written on the subject of flywheels and parallel operation of generating units, that the object of this paper is not to attempt to develop any entirely new method of flywheel calculation, but rather to collect and apply the available information and put it into convenient shape for practical use. The consideration of torsional vibrations in connection with the determination of flywheel sizes is frequently of the greatest importance, especially in the case of large multicylindered oil engines, and should not be overlooked. However it is beyond the scope of this paper and so will not be considered here."
"IN TESTS conducted in connection with several d-c railway electrifications, the induced voltages recorded in paralleling communication circuits at times of short circuit on the railway have shown marked divergences from values computed on the basis of uniform earth resistivity and a rate of change of earth current determined from measurements in trolley and rail circuits. Due to the numerous factors which might contribute to these divergences, such as nonuniform division of transient current along the tracks and associated return conductors, the presence of shielding conductors along or near the right-of-way, etc., it was felt that a better understanding of the problem of induction under d-c transient conditions could be obtained by experimental studies of the transient coupling between parallel earth-return circuits, free from the effects of shielding conductors, and with concentrated, rather than distributed, grounds. The study described in this paper was undertaken for this purpose."
"The problems associated with brush application on commutaling-type equipment in the iron and steel industry are discussed in relation to type of equipment and conditions encountered in service. The paper also discusses a newly defined measure of brush performance, termed “commutation factor,” which provides an improved basis for control of the performance characteristics of brushes. Mention is made of the development of electrographitic grades having mild polishing action, designed to prevent the formation of troublesome surface film on commutators exposed to the contaminating atmospheric conditions frequently encountered in steel mill applications."
"The results of a study of the resistance of small single-layer inductances for use at frequencies between 4 and 25 megacycles are given. From experimental and analytical work a procedure has been deduced for the optimum design of such inductances."
"IT IS THE purpose of this paper to develop in a concise and simple manner the theory of matrix algebra from the foundations, and to emphasize the use of this powerful method in engineering problems."
"A LARGE PERCENTAGE of secondary cable faults in distribution networks “burn clear” rapidly. In such cases, the short-circuit current to the fault has not persisted for a sufficiently long period of time to raise the temperature of the cable conductor on either side of the fault to a high enough temperature to fuse, or permanently damage adjacent cable insulation. However, not even the most optimistic treatises on “burnoff” have ever asserted that all secondary cable faults are of this accommodating type. Furthermore, the fault consists of an electric arc between a number of energized copper conductors confined in the small space of the duct, surrounded by masses of molten metal and with water frequently present. Under such a combination of conditions, who can contend that the fault can be depended upon to always clear in time to protect the insulation of cables supplying the fault current?"
"An extension of the 2-reaction theory of synchronous machines as developed by R. H. Park is given in this paper for machines with any number of phases."
"ON THIS and the following 2 pages appear all remaining discussions submitted for publication, and approved by the technical committees, on papers presented at the 1937 AIEE winter convention, New York, N. Y., January 25–29. Discussions of papers presented at the sessions on general power applications, vibration and balance, communication and research, power transmission, education, power generation and electrical machinery, instruments and measurements, insulation co-ordination, and lightning protective equipment at the 1937 AIEE summer convention, Milwaukee, Wis., June 21–25, now are being reviewed by the technical committees, and will appear in ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING as they are released for publication."
"AKRON, OHIO, will be host to a 3-day meeting of the Middle Eastern District of the AIEE, October 13–15, 1937. The meeting headquarters will be in the Mayflower Hotel. The local committees have arranged an attractive technical program which consists of 6 sessions and a student session to be held during the mornings and have planned for the afternoons and evenings interesting inspection trips, entertainment, and a banquet. In addition, a special program has been arranged for the women, who are especially urged to attend the meeting."
"Engineers and engineering organizations have a new directory and biographical dictionary in the fourth edition of “Who's Who in Engineering,” which has just been published by the Lewis Historical Publishing Company, Inc., 8th Avenue and 14th Street, New York, N. Y. It is well done and is a most excellent reference volume. In addition to the biographical dictionary this issue carries a comprehensive list of engineering organizations in the United States and brief descriptions of each of several functional instrumentalities of engineering societies."

"Water-Level Control. Control of the water level in a model of the Cape Cod (Mass.) Canal and the automatic recording of water level at several points during studies of flow were accomplished electrically by utilizing the capacitance between the water itself and a plate suspended above it, together with suitable vacuum-tube amplifiers, grid-controlled arc-discharge tubes, and Selsyn motors (pages 237–44)."
"1936 is now history. Whatever we have accomplished, or failed to accomplish, is written into the records and we cannot change it. The engineer is interested in history as a guide to the future, but what most intensely interests him is that which he may accomplish in the future. Every keen-minded member of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers is greatly interested in the future accomplishments of the organization."
"The characteristics of engineering that should give the engineer a stronger sense of economic and social responsibility than is sometimes felt by those in other professions are discussed in this article, which suggests that an engineering approach should be made to economic problems."

"Switchboards for the power plant at Boulder Dam are unusual not alone for their size, but also for the combination in one plant of switchboard designs and methods that have been used individually but seldom together. The plan of the power plant and the switchboards and control equipment are described in this paper."
"Control of water level according to a predetermined cycle and its automatic recording in a model of the Cape Cod Canal have been accomplished by electrical means which depend for operation upon the capacitances between the surface of the water and metal plates suspended above the water. The theory of operation and the apparatus are described in this paper."
"Data pertaining to lightning currents actually measured in tower structures, counterpoises, and ground wires on 132-kv lines during 1933–36 are presented in this paper. It is concluded that stroke currents rarely exceed 150,000 amperes, although 220,000 amperes has been indicated, and that currents as high as 60,000 amperes measured in the overhead ground wires indicate the necessity of adequate shielding of the line at station entrances."
"A method of recording, by means of an oscillograph, the eddy currents in various parts of the cross section of a squirrel-cage-rotor bar is presented in this paper. From such records the magnitude of the power loss caused by eddy currents, and its variation with load, may be determined. A series of tests of this nature has been made; the results, which the author believes to be correct in general, show that the change of eddy-current loss with load is negligible, thus simplifying the determination of the composite stray-load loss of a squirrel-cage induction motor."
"Use of image conductors in iron, of Rayleigh insulating partitions, and of images of conductors in these partitions is shown in this paper to afford one possible line of attack on the problem of the reactance of the end connections of electrical machinery. The use of 2 other methods to reduce the field in the end zone to a basis where Ampere's equation may be correctly applied is also suggested."

"Earnings of Engineers. Statistics based upon monthly earnings of engineers suggest conclusions different from those deduced by an analysis of the annual earnings. A continuation of a comprehensive survey of employment in the engineering profession shows marked differences in earnings within each professional class, and within each group classified on the basis of educational background (pages 1450–60)."
"AT ITS MEETING on October 28 your board of directors adopted the budget for the year ending September 30, 1938, the details of which are covered on pages 1522–4. There are some phases of the board's consideration of the budget which seem of special interest."
"The dielectric circuit is a baffling enigma to many undergraduate students of electrical engineering; indeed, to many engineers whose work is not intimately concerned with it. This outline of some of the elementary notions regarding electrostatics and the dielectric circuit is presented here because of its possible interest and value to students and others wishing to review the subject with the aim of attaining a working knowledge of it."
"Improvements in the transmitter and receiver, instruments basic to the telephone art, continually have led to a higher grade of service and further economies. Research work has made possible predetermination of performance by calculation; the effect of studies of speech sounds, hearing, materials, and testing methods on the development of instruments giving high quality for conversation is shown by this article, which is based on one of three Iwadare lectures∗ delivered in 1937."

Comparisons may be drawn among professional classes, ages, and educational background."
"THE BOSTON Elevated Railway serves a population of about 1,531,000 people, distributed over an area of 111.56 square miles and segregated in 14 municipalities, including both towns and cities. Within its territory the railway supplies practically all of the public transportation, except taxicabs. The backbone of its system is formed by its rapid-transit division, with elevated lines, subways and some leased surface right-of-way. The rapid-transit lines are confined to Boston and Cambridge."
"THE INVESTIGATION described in this paper was undertaken to determine the magnitude and characteristics of the abnormal voltage transients accompanying the operation of load ratio control contactors on power transformers. As test results definitely established the fact that currents may be abruptly ruptured at other than normal current zero, accompanied by very severe over-voltages, the main purpose of the paper was directed to this phenomena, both from the experimental and theoretical viewpoint. It is believed that the subject will prove interesting to anyone concerned with switching surges in general, especially in view of the fact that certain aspects of the phenomena appear not to have been presented heretofore. Thus, the effect of current interruption at other than normal frequency current zero is gone into in detail; general equations on recurrent restriking are given; the extremely interesting possibility of restriking so as to practically discontinue the voltage transient is described; and the paradox of an increase in recovery voltage when shunt capacitance is increased is explained. These points are illustrated and supported by oscillographic evidence."
"IN proportion as the concept of “laws of nature” grows larger to include individual human behavior and group action, the engineer is called upon to apply his time-tested methods to broader problems of state and country. The usual definition of engineering, as the science and art of applying laws of nature to human needs, still holds; only the laws of nature cannot be limited any longer to those of levers and expanding steam. Sales engineering and works management have been the two windows through which the mechanistically minded engineer has been made to see broader aspects of his profession, involving fickle human will, prejudices, and emotional response. It is true that these propensities cannot yet be predicted with the same accuracy as the strength of a beam or the behavior of an electric generator, but the engineer has always included a lot of intuitive art (horse sense) as a part of his professional make-up anyway. As the laws of human behavior become better known we may expect an ever increasing influence of properly trained engineers upon our political, economic, and social life."
"SOME EXAMPLES of multiple unbalances on a 3-phase network are: 1. Two or more unsymmetrical short circuits at different points of a network. Faults involving more than one circuit are not unusual on multicircuit lines, and simultaneous faults sometimes occur even at geographically separated points, especially on systems grounded through high impedance. System stability or operation of relays during such faults may require investigation. 2. A short circuit partially cleared by the blowing of a fuse. 3. A short circuit on a line having series capacitors, the capacitors in the faulted conductor being short circuited by protective devices. 4. Two or more single-phase or unbalanced loads."
"This paper describes the operation of a modern trolley coach system. This system was installed one year ago with a single line and a few coaches. Now there are 7 lines in operation, the total route lengths exceeding 45 miles and requiring 40 coaches, each of which has a seating capacity of forty persons. The paper is generally divided into 2 parts, the first dealing with descriptions of the system and equipment, and the second part setting forth such experiences as have been gained in one year of operation."
"This article describes a method of measuring stray-load losses which is readily adaptable to the test departments of the manufacturers. Usually no additional test apparatus will be required beyond that already available. The same arrangement used for a pump-back heat-run test is used with only slight modification. Experimental data are given showing the effect of speed, load, and field strength upon these losses."
"MUCH HAS BEEN written recently on the influence of oil oxidation on the properties and stability of impregnated paper insulation. It is thought by many to be a principal cause of deterioration in high voltage cables. Oxygen is highly soluble in cable oils; if present in appreciable quantity and at moderate temperature elevation, the oils oxidize rapidly with consequent loss of insulating value. However, the amount of oxygen remaining in a carefully dried paper cable is so small, and the oxidation process is so slow that it remains to be proved that it is more important in deterioration than other well-known causes."

"ROBERT CALTHROP BROWN (A'03, member for life) vice-president of the Brazilian Tramway, Light, and Power Company, Barcelona Tramway, Light, and Power Company, Mexican Light and Power Company, Mexico Tramway Company, and Canadian and General Finance Company, Ltd., Toronto, Ont., Canada, died October 30, 1937. Mr. Brown, born June 1, 1866, at Medford, Mass., was graduated from Tufts College with the degree of bachelor of arts in 1888, and received the degree of electrical engineer in 1894. In 1889 he was employed by the Somerville Electric Light Company as lineman, but later in the same year entered the employ of the West End Street Railway Company, Boston, Mass., in its engineering department. In 1890 he was appointed assistant superintendent of electric power in the same company, which position he held for one year before resigning to take charge of the electrical work of the Brooklyn City Railroad, Brooklyn, N. Y., in 1891. In 1894 Mr. Brown became affiliated with the Montreal Street Railway Company as an electrical engineer, and from 1895 to 1898 was employed by the Halifax Tramway, Light, and Power Company as general manager. In 1899 he went to Brazil, where he remained until 1901 as general manager of the Sao Paulo Tramway, Light, and Power Company. From 1902 until 1905 he served as electrical engineer with the Toronto and the Niagara River Power Company; in 1906 he was appointed managing director of the Mexican Tramways Company, Mexico City, and subsequently held numerous offices in Mexican and South American companies."

"This multientry annual reference index covers comprehensively the entire text content of the 12 issues of ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING published during 1937 and the identical content of the 1937 AIEE TRANSACTIONS, volume 56; the index covers also a supplement of 28 pages published in the TRANSACTIONS, which contains the following two papers not published in ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING: 1. FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF SYNCHRONOUS MACHINE REACTANCES, by B.R. Prentice (pages 1-21 of supplement). 2. PER-UNIT QUANTITIES, by Irven Travis (pages 22-8 of supplement). A special effort has been made to provide effective correlation between references to technical papers and all published discussions of those papers. Discussions of many technical papers published during the latter part of 1936 were published in the early part of 1937, and hence appear in this current index. Likewise, many discussions of the later 1937 papers will be published early in 1938, and consequently will not be found among the references contained in this current index. For convenience in use, this index is subdivided into the following general sections: 1. Technical subjects; 2. Authors, including the writers of discussions; 3. News items pertaining to Institute activities; 4. News items of a general nature; and 5. Biographical (personal and obituary) items."

"I SHOULD LIKE to take this opportunity to say to all of you what I had the privilege of saying to those at the summer convention in Milwaukee in response to notification of election as president: Instinctively I feel sure you understand how wholly inadequate words of mine are to express appreciation of the great honor the membership of the Institute has conferred upon me."
"Whether democracy in America can endure depends in no small measure upon the attitude of the great professional classes in general, and in particular upon the attitude and effectiveness of the engineer in his relation to government, says this well-known engineer and educator, who states further that although there is an enormously complex system of organizations of scientists and engineers in the United States, this mechanism is not utilized to the full in expressing the viewpoints of engineers generally upon important public questions. To meet this need, Doctor Bush suggests that the organization of engineers should be integrated, simplified, and strengthened."
"What can and should engineers do about the social and economic problems that beset the modern world? In answering this question, Doctor Flanders says: “We must exercise our responsibility more for the sake of society as a whole than for the sake of ourselves as individual engineers or for the private interests of the businesses with which we may be connected.” He states further that: “It is an inescapable duty that we each make of ourselves centers of education and influence, to the end that our useful offices may continue, and our civilization fulfill its destiny of an ever-growing service to the needs of mankind.”"
"DURING this past year I have talked with and consulted many engineers. I have learned of their ideas and their ideals. They are men of purpose and conviction. The engineering record of the last 50 years is astounding; but these men are not satisfied. The typical engineer is more interested in the problems of the future than in the accomplishments of the past. The engineering profession demands that the engineer of tomorrow shall be broader and greater than the engineer of today or yesterday."
"OF ALL the definitions of engineering that have been propounded, the one that seems to express most clearly and accurately the true function of the engineer is found in the preamble to the constitution of American Engineering Council. In that document engineering is defined as the “science of controlling the forces and utilizing the materials of nature for the benefit of man, and the art of organizing and directing human activities in connection therewith.”"
"Recognition of outstanding young American electrical engineers by Eta Kappa Nu, honorary electrical engineering society, began with the presentation of awards for 1936. The society expects its plan of annual awards to incite a fuller and broader professional development of young electrical engineers. Statistics for the men nominated for the 1936 awards are presented and discussed in this article."
"Unit heaters of the industrial type have been applied for external cooling of transformers and found to be especially useful as a substitute for the original water cooling system or as a supplement to the regular cooling system. Portable substations of smaller size and reduced weight were made possible by the use of these units."
"Surface units of electric ranges have various efficiencies of heat transfer according to the design of the unit. Results of a study made with bright- and black-bottomed utensils are reported in this prize-winning student paper."
"THE ELECTRICAL system plays a very important part in present-day airplanes. In addition to lighting the plane and starting the engines, it is required to furnish power for radio, instruments, landing gear, flaps, and remote operations. The fact that electrical operation leads to more convenient and often lighter installations makes it desirable to use it whenever applicable."
"This paper undertakes to state briefly the plans of organization of the Ontario Hydro-Electric Commission, the British Grid, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and then the proposals made by the planning bodies and in bills submitted to Congress for the public administration of power from Bonneville and Grand Coulee. (I have not received Senate Bill No. 2092, and H.R. 6151, a bill prepared by the Senators of Oregon and Washington, which is more similar, I suspect, to their bill described herein which died with the 74th Congress. I would have been glad to add a summary of this bill if time had permitted.)"
"DURING the last few years, the problem of increasing the continuity of service of electric transmission systems has been given considerable study. Of all the proposals by which it is intended to bring about a reduction in outages, the practice of ultrahigh-speed reclosing of oil circuit breakers gives promise of the most effective and most economical solution."
"IN TRANSMITTING speech over radiotelephone circuits there are a number of conventional methods of increasing the signal with respect to the noise. Examples of such methods are the use of higher power, directive antennas, diversity reception, and filters to narrow the received frequency band. In addition, there are other methods of a special character which reduce the effect of the noise interference with the speech transmission. One example of such a device limits the noise interference by eliminating the high peaks of noise of very short duration and depending upon the persistence of sensation of speech in the ear to bridge the gaps. Another method diminishes the noise in intervals of no speech. This is the method which will be discussed here."
"IN THE past several years series capacitors for the compensation of line drop in power circuits have found increasing use,1–9 because improved and automatic voltage regulation can, in many cases, be obtained more economically by this method than by any other means."
"THE PHENOMENON of starting currents in transformers has been quite fully studied by several investigators,1,2 especially when the transformer is without load. Little information, however, can be found in the technical literature on this subject when the transformer is loaded, let alone the effect of various load power factors."
"A harmonic generator circuit is described which produces a number of harmonics simultaneously at substantially uniform amplitudes by means of a nonlinear coil. Generators of this type have been used for the supply of carrier currents to multichannel telephone systems, for the synchronization of carrier frequencies in radio transmitters, and for frequency comparison and standardization."
"Radiation resistance, although ordinarily neglected, is actually of dominant importance in determining the selectivity factor Q and the input impedance Zs for both parallel-wire and concentric lines at high radio frequencies, and therefore materially changes the optimum design of the line, whether used as a low-loss inductive or capacitive reactance or to give high selectivity or high impedance as a resonant line. Accurate design equations for maximum selectivity and for maximum impedance are developed in this paper for both parallel-wire and concentric lines, and curves are included showing radiation resistance, selectivity, input impedance, optimum values of spacing, conductor radius, etc. It is shown that for maximum Q the optimum ratio of spacing to wire radius for parallel-wire lines is D/r = 6.186, and the ratio of outer conductor radius to inner conductor radius for concentric lines is b/a = 4.22, as compared with values of about 3.6 for both ratios when radiation resistance is neglected. For maximum impedance corresponding values are D/r = 20.96 and b/a = 14.3, as compared with values of 8 and 9.2, respectively, predicted neglecting radiation resistance. Moreover, Q and Zs are not proportional to D and b as indicated in previous analyses; instead definite values of D and b give maximum Q and slightly larger values give maximum Zs, and even a small departure from the best value produces a large decrease in Q or in Zs. Q and Zs for optimum design are both inversely proportional to the cube root of the frequency for parallel-wire lines and inversely proportional to the 0.4 power of the frequency for concentric lines, whereas previous analyses showed both increasing as the square root of the frequency."
"THE INTERCONNECTION of ordinary telephone systems by means of long radiotelephone links presents some unique and interesting technical problems. Since radio noise is often severe as compared with that in wire lines, radio transmitter power capacity is relatively large and expensive, and it is in general economical to control the speech volumes so that the radio transmitter will be fully loaded and thus the effect of noise minimized for a given transmitter power rating. This volume control, to be fully effective, calls for voice-operated switching devices to suppress echoes and singing."
"This paper discusses the need for good distribution of the voltage among the interrupters of a high-voltage multibreak circuit breaker and the results which have been obtained using capacitances."
"ON THIS and the following 16 pages appear discussions submitted for publication, and approved by the technical committees, on papers presented at the sessions on tensor analysis, synchronous machinery, and protective devices at the 1937 AIEE winter convention, New York, N. Y., January 25–29, and on one paper not presented at an AIEE meeting. Authors' closures, where they have been submitted, will be found at the end of the discussion of their respective papers."

"Discussion and authors' closure of a paper by Philip Sporn and D. C. Prince published in the January 1937 issue, pages 81–90, and presented for oral discussion at the protective devices session of the winter convention, New York, N. Y., January 27,1937."
"Discussion and authors' closure of a paper by Ralph Higgins and H. L. Rorden published in the September 1936 issue, pages 1029–34, and presented for oral discussion at the protective devices session of the winter convention, New York, N. Y., January 27, 1937."
"IN 1906 the Institute held its 23d annual summer convention in Milwaukee, Wis. Just 31 years and 3 weeks later, Milwaukee again played host to the Institute, this time for its 53d annual summer convention (none was held in 1917). Several unusual features marked the program of the 1937 convention held June 21–25, with headquarters at the Schroeder Hotel."
"Provides a listing of current committee members and society officers."
"Council is being called upon by members of Congress, engineers, and educators in the land-grant-college groups to support legislation proposing to increase the number of engineering-experiment stations and for advice regarding the attitude that should be taken toward such legislation. It has also come to Council's attention that there is competition between the “A and M” colleges and state universities for the allocation of funds for the construction and operation of engineering-experiment stations."
"CONTRIBUTIONS to these columns are invited from Institute members and subscribers. They should be concise and may deal with technical papers, articles published in previous issues, or other subjects of some general interest and professional importance. ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING will endeavor to publish as many letters as possible, but of necessity reserves the right to publish them in whole or in part, or reject them entirely."
"H. B. DATES (A'98, F'32, member for life) professor and head of the department of electrical engineering, Case School of Applied Science, Cleveland, Ohio, has been elected president of the Illuminating Engineering Society. Professor Dates was born July 15, 1869, at New Britain, Conn., and received the degrees of bachelor of science in electrical engineering and electrical engineer (honorary, 1908) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Case School of Applied Science, respectively. From 1894 until early in 1896 he worked as a laboratory tester and inspector for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company at Newark, N. J., and East Pittsburgh, Pa. In 1896 he received an appointment as professor of physics and electrical engineering at Clarkson School of Technology, where he organized the departments of physics and electrical engineering, planned the curricula, and equipped the laboratories. Professor Dates remained at Clarkson until 1903, when he became professor of electrical engineering and dean of the college of engineering at the University of Colorado. He has been head of the school of electrical engineering at the Case School of Applied Science since 1905, where, in addition to his regular teaching and administrative duties, he has served as a consulting engineer for the Cleveland Board of Education and for several commercial organizations. Professor Dates is a member of the Institute's committee on production and application of light, and was the first chairman (1907–08) of the Cleveland Section. He is a past-vice-president of the Illuminating Engineering Society, a member of the United States National Committee of the International Commission on Illumination, and a member or former member of several committees of that society. Professor Dates is the author of many books and papers on illumination. He is a member of the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education, Sigma Xi, and Eta Kappa Nu."
"Applications have been received at headquarters from the following list of candidates for election to membership in the Institute. If the applicant has applied for direct admission to a grade higher than Associate, the grade follows immediately after the name. Any member objecting to the election of any of these candidates should so inform the national secretary."
"Among the new books received at the Engineering Societies Library, New York, recently are the following which have been selected because of their possible interest to the electrical engineer. Unless otherwise specified, books listed have been presented gratis by the publishers.

"“ON what subject would you like a message from the president?” I asked 2 young engineers who have recently joined the AIEE. Their answer was, “Tell us about the work of the other Sections.” So I was led to review my pleasant travels of the last 9 months, and the many Sections I have been privileged to visit."
"The advance of engineering has a vital bearing upon economic progress; in turn, though perhaps less obviously, the operation of the economic system largely determines the rate at which new engineering discoveries may be applied in the actual production of wealth. From this point of view Doctor Moulton discussed progress in the interdependent fields of engineering and economics in the Eleventh Steinmetz Memorial Lecture,∗ full text of which is presented here."
"Getting more power from less fuel, and consequently providing the public with a dependable supply of electric power at low rates, is the goal toward which power engineers have aimed for many years. In striving toward this goal, they have made significant contributions to society, some of which are indicated in this article"
"Between 1930 and 1934 there was a substantial net loss of employment among those engineers in the United States who entered the profession before 1930, and a considerable absorption in employment of newcomers to the profession. This is one important conclusion reached by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor after analyzing reports from 52,589 professional engineers obtained in the 1935 survey of the engineering profession conducted by the Bureau at the request and with the co-operation of American Engineering Council. This article,∗ third in the series reporting the results of this survey, presents data pertaining to the employment of engineers during 1929–34."
"The history and development of police radiocommunication is discussed and an outline given of the federal regulations under which this type of service is rendered together with reasons therefor. The problems arising in the selection of equipment and during the installation and operation of police radio systems are discussed. The methods of operation of the various classes of police radio services are described. The various uses of radio covered by this paper are: 1. By municipalities for one-way communication to mobile units and remote police stations 2. By municipalities for 2-way communication with mobile units 3. By states in the general dispatching of state police units 4. By states and municipalities for the ratiotelegraphic exchange of police information 5. By harbor police in connection with the dispatching of harbor police boats and general policing of shipping 6. By states for emergency radiotelegraphi e use in the event of interruption of the wire teletype network"
"Comprehensive surveys have shown the general inadequacy of artificial lighting in industry. The rapid increase of scientific knowledge on the relations of light and seeing has opened a new approach to the specification of lighting for industrial processes involving critical studies of the visual tasks, and the quality and quantity of the illumination needed. Results of the application of this new method are described in this paper."
"EXPERIENCE with the expulsion protective gap since 1932, when the first commercial installation was made, has demonstrated the efficacy of this device as a means of improving service by preventing lightning outages on overhead transmission lines."
"It is difficult to find a mathematical formula which will fully agree with observed data on corona loss under all conditions. Therefore, a purely empirical method of corona loss calculation has been developed, based on analysis and co-ordination of the experimental data which have been accumulated at Stanford University."
"The results of tests made on 9 viscous mineral oils of various types and on mixtures of these oils with 8 resins are presented. The physical and electrical properties, stability to oxidation, and stability to gaseous ionization are correlated with the viscosity index and chemical composition of the oils and resins. The catalytic effects of metals on oil oxidation are studied. Gaseous ionization in insulation voids is found to exert a physical pressure and to accelerate saturant oxidation."
"THE intelligent application of lightning arresters requires a knowledge of their performance characteristics under conditions which are likely to be encountered in service. Data have been presented relating to the impulse characteristics of insulation both as used on lines and in transformers. In order to know what protection may be secured with certainty in service, data are also required concerning the rates of voltage rise to be expected on distribution type arresters and the current encountered as a result of natural lightning. These data are being obtained, in some measure at least, through the use of impulse current measuring devices in series with arresters in service. Very little satisfactory information is available, however, with respect to the actual rates of potential rise, in fact most of such information is based on deduction rather than actual measurement."
"A “coincidental electric drive” may be defined as a drive consisting of several units of one machine, or a group of machines; each unit or machine driven by a separate motor. For successful operation, each unit or machine must have a speed bearing a definite relation to the speed of each of the other units. This speed relation may be constant or varying."
"Magnetic contactors as commutating devices for the application of power for very brief periods (as in resistance welding practice) have encountered limitations which have been considered inherent in their nature. The author has found that this is not necessarily the case, and describes a method of operating magnetic contactors which to a great extent avoids the usual limitations and gives short periods of great accuracy."
"An investigation of motor protection can be made by a comparison of the proper motor and thermal overload relay data. Convenient data for this are motor “protection” curves for comparison with “tripping time” curves of thermal overload relays. These motor curves should include single phase operation of polyphase motors as this is one of the abnormal conditions for which motors should be protected. The capacity of the motor at different expected ambient temperatures should be compared with the capacity of the overload relay at its corresponding ambient temperatures."
"ONE OF the important functions of the Institute is to provide specifications relating to the standardization of testing equipments and methods. Since the publication of AIEE Standards No. 4, May 1928, considerable progress has been made in the extension and revision of the calibrations for the grounded sphere gap for both 60-cycle and impulse voltages. This paper presents data which should be of assistance in establishing the calibrations of ungrounded sphere gaps. In addition to these data, the paper also describes the equipment and method used in determining the crest voltage applied to the spheres and the means of determining the spacing at spark-over. Data are also presented upon the effect of ultraviolet irradiation of the spheres."
"Based on the observed phenomenon that flashover of transmission-line towers provided with 2 overhead ground wires occurs only when the product of towerfooting resistance and tower surge current exceeds the insulation strength, the probable outages that will occur on a line can be obtained by a simple method. Only those factors enter into the calculations which have become generally accepted quantitatively."
"ON this and the following 33 pages appear discussions submitted for publication, and approved by the technical committees, on papers presented at the sessions on electrophysics, electrical machinery, induction machinery, power transmission, and tensor analysis at the 1937 AIEE winter convention, New York, N. Y., January 25–29. Authors' closures, where they have been submitted, will be found at the end of the discussion on their respective papers. Members anywhere are encouraged to submit written discussion of any paper published in ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, which discussion will be reviewed by the proper technical committee and considered for possible publication in a subsequent issue. Discussions of papers scheduled for presentation at any AIEE meeting or convention will be closed 2 weeks after presentation. Discussions should be (1) concise; (2) restricted to the subject of the paper or papers under consideration; and (3) typewritten and submitted in triplicate to C. S. Rich, secretary, technical program committee, AIEE headquarters, 33 West 39th Street, New York, N. Y."
"THE Institute's annual summer convention, which will be held in Milwaukee, Wis., June 21–25, 1937, with headquarters in the Schroeder Hotel, offers many unique features. Milwaukee, situated on the shore of Lake Michigan, and the State of Wisconsin, with its numerous inland lakes, possess an unusual appeal for all lovers of sports and nature to combine business with vacation. The schedule of events includes the annual business meeting, 10 technical sessions, and 1 general session which is designed to interest a great many members and which is not concurrent with any of the other sessions. The afternoons will be devoted principally to committee meetings, conference sessions, sports, and inspection trips to plants of internationally known manufacturers. Evenings will be devoted to social functions and entertainment."

"EDGAR KNOWLTON (A'll) electrical engineer, General Electric Company, Schenectady, N. Y., died January 19, 1937. Mr. Knowlton was born July 7, 1871, at Portland, Me., and received his formal engineering education through correspondence schools and independent study. He entered the employ of the General Electric Company in 1893 as a draftsman on a-c motor and generator design, and was continuously associated with that company for almost 44 years. In 1899 Mr. Knowlton was transferred to the a-c engineering department on preliminary mechanical and electrical design of a-c machinery, and in 1903 was transferred to the design of turboalternators. Later he was placed in charge of turbogenerator design, and for many years was engaged in a-c engineering problems."

"AT least once each year, the president should discuss with the members the subject of membership; for without members there could be no organization, and our fundamental purposes would be impossible of accomplishment. The major accomplishment of the Institute results from the voluntary service so willingly rendered by the national and District officers and committees, the Section's officers and committees, and the authors of the technical papers — a service much greater than, and in addition to, their financial support. However, a great work cannot be accomplished without expense, and funds are necessary to meet these expenses."
"Apart from the more obvious uses of electrical devices for aircraft communication and navigation, electricity is playing an increasingly important rôle on board modern airliners."
"A new incinerator plant at Providence, R. I., uses the hot gases from a 5-cell incinerator with a normal capacity of 160 tons of refuse per 24 hours to generate steam in a 700-horsepower boiler at a pressure of 200 pounds per square inch. The steam is used in a 1,250-kw turbogenerator which furnishes power for operating the city's sewage disposal plant and will furnish power for a sewage pumping station now being motorized. A duplicate boiler and turbogenerator assure continuous service. The view above shows wrapped garbage and refuse being dumped into the 1,000-cubic-yard storage pit. At the right is shown the exterior of the building, with conveyor and hopper for ash removal; below is a view of a turbogenerator (Westinghouse photos)"
"A NEW demonstration of the potentialities of the reproduction of orchestral music in auditory perspective was given at the Hollywood Bowl in California last August, when music reproduced in this manner was heard for the first time out-of-doors with the orchestra present. The occasion was a concert presented by Paramount Pictures with Leopold Stokowski acting as the conductor."
"Because it is considered to be timely, informative, and lucid, this article is republished∗ here so that the many members of the Institute who are interested in, but not intimately associated with, the field of engineering education may have the benefit of a reflection of current practices and trends in engineering education as seen by a recognized authority in that field."
"ENGINEERING educators are familiar with the development of graduate work in engineering during the past 15 years, and know that graduate registrations have greatly increased during this period. The increasing importance of graduate training suggests that in large metropolitan communities opportunities should be provided to enable young engineers to carry on a program of advanced study through part-time classes while regularly employed."
"APRINCIPLE on which there seems to be universal agreement is that it is notthe aim of the undergraduate curriculum to produce “finished” engineers — men capable of engaging in responsible professional practice. It follows, therefore, since the profession is concerned in the eventual development of men capable of such practice, that consideration — very careful consideration — should be given to that phase of engineering education, and of professional development, which follows the stage marked by the award of the bachelor's degree. This seems so obvious as scarcely to need statement, yet it is a matter to which very little constructive effort has been devoted and to which, until now, none has been directed by the profession as a whole."
"AMAN is able to convey his thoughts to another person only as perfectly as his own means of expression and the other's understanding of it will permit. Most people in our country are limited to the use of just one tool for this purpose — the English language. How great a part it plays in our lives! How great, then, should be its development! Yet engineers are notoriously weak in their mastery of it."
"THE RESULTS of an extensive oscillographic study of power-system faults to ground are presented herewith. While this study was made primarily to obtain data useful in inductive co-ordination problems, the results are believed to be of general interest as well. They provide data on such items as frequency of occurrence of ground-current disturbances, their monthly distribution, duration, cause, method of clearance, and wave-trace characteristics. Data on fault resistance are given in part II, a companion paper."
"AN ALLOWANCE for fault resistance in fault current computations is desirable in certain types of problems. The present paper gives the results of a study made to determine reasonable values of fault resistance to use in computing line-to-ground fault currents, particularly in inductive co-ordination studies. The sources and nature of the data used in the study are described in a companion paper.1"
"WHEN supplying large lighting loads such as theaters, hotels, or department stores by the 4-kv primary circuits, in many cases it has been desirable to utilize only 2 phases of the 3-phase 4-wire system. These loads are fed by 2 transformers connected in open Y on both the primary and secondary. Such an arrangement is made in order to avoid connecting large lighting loads on only one phase of the 4-kv circuit, thus maintaining a better load balance on the primaries and also obtaining an economical 3-wire secondary distribution system."
"THE automatic oscillograph has been available for about 7 years,1,2 but until 8-cycle oil switches and l-to-6-cycle relays were in general use, the automatic oscillograph was not used extensively because the performance of the slower relays and switches could be checked at low cost by various forms of high-speed graphic meters. With the present high-speed relays and oil switches, the automatic oscillograph is considered almost a necessity."
"THE MEASUREMENT of magnetic fields in air gaps by the existing methods, is almost as cumbersome as light measurements were before the introduction of the photronic cell or photoelectric tube into that field. This paper describes a meter for the measurement of magnetic flux which seems to parallel the advance made in the lighting field."
"IN VIEW of the frequent criticism of engineers to the effect that they do not pay sufficient attention to economic and business factors, a brief review of the present activities of engineers is given. It is pointed out that they are extensively and, successfully handling economic problems relating directly to their specific line of work but that they are inclined to overlook other economic and business factors equally important but somewhat removed from their daily tasks. In order to stimulate the interest of the younger engineers in economics and to give them a broader viewpoint of the business enterprises in which they will be engaged, a brief but fairly comprehensive course on “industrial economics and business methods” is advocated to be given in preference to some of the highly specialized technical courses now forming part of the undergraduate curricula. The paper outlines the type of subjects which seem suitable for this course and further recommends that analytical methods of attack be employed to a greater extent than is now customary in economic studies."
"IN PREVIOUS PAPERS it has been found necessary to consider the armature inductance of salient-pole synchronous machines under several divisions. The most useful and generally accepted divisions are as follows : 1. Inductance of armature reaction 2. Inductance due to space harmonics in the core length or differential leakage, which is subdivided into a. Belt leakage inductance b. Zigzag leakage inductance 3. Slot leakage inductance 4. End-winding inductance"
"ALTHOUGH several different types of alternator-voltage regulators are in successful operation at present, the purpose of this paper is to describe a regulator which is believed to have several outstanding advantages over any of the present types. The inherent limitations of the various types of moving-contact regulators are well known, and a perusal of the circuit diagrams1 of the different types of electronic regulators will indicate the complexity of such circuits, even though they are superior in most respects to the moving-contact-type regulators."
"IT is generally agreed that of the component parts of impregnated paper, the impregnating oil is most susceptible to deterioration. There is, however little definite knowledge of the processes leading to instability. Instability manifests itself in changes in electrical properties. An increase in dielectric loss, if allowed to continue, ultimately leads to failure. Marked chemical changes often accompany these changes in electric properties, but whether or not the changes are caused by electrical stress, as related to the inherent chemical structure of the oil, or by residual impurities, as related to stress and structure, or by both jointly is as yet unknown. Obviously oxidation, with its generation of acids and consequent increase in chemical dissociation and electrical conductivity is a powerful cause of instability. Although careful provision is made for the elimination of oxygen in the manufacture of insulation, it is recognized that traces of oxygen must remain under all circumstances, and the determination of the degree of its activity as a cause of insulation instability becomes a matter of great importance."
"ON THIS and the following 4 pages appears a part of the discussion presented at the electrophysics session of the AIEE winter, convention, New York, N. Y., January 28, 1937. Other discussion of winter convention papers will be published in later issues. Authors' closures, where they have been submitted, will be found at the end of their respective papers."
"CONCLUDING one of the longest, most varied, and most fruitful careers in electrical engineering, Elihu Thomson died at his home in Swampscott, Mass., on March 13, 1937, just a few days before his eighty-fourth birthday. Indisputably the dean of American electrical engineers, he was regarded as being second to none among the small group of his contemporaries upon whose inventive genius the electrical industry of the world was founded and through whose perseverance and keen foresight it grew."
"CONTRIBUTIONS to these columns are invited from Institute members and subscribers. They should be concise and may deal with technical papers, articles published in previous issues, or other subjects of some general interest and professional importance.

"F. L. HUNT (A'05, F'17) director of economics and engineering of Western Massachusetts Companies, Greenfield, Mass., has been elected vice-president of that association and of each of its constituent utility companies, and assigned the duty of general charge of operations of those companies. Mr. Hunt was born at Delta, Iowa, in 1879, and was graduated from the University of Nebraska with the degree of bachelor of science in electrical engineering in 1902. Following his graduation he spent 3 years in the testing department of the General Electric Company, Schenectady, N. Y. In 1905 he was transferred to the Boston, Mass., offices of the General Electric Company, where he was in charge of construction work in New England, and later assistant district engineer. In 1913 Mr. Hunt accepted the position of chief engineer of the Turner Falls Power and Electric Company and allied companies in Greenfield, Mass., and in 1927 when Western Massachusetts Companies was formed, including the Turner Falls Power and Electric Company, United Electric Light Company, Pittsfield Electric Company, and the Greenfield Electric Light and Power Company (now Western Massachusetts Electric Company), Mr. Hunt was appointed director of economics and engineering of those companies. He has served the Institute as a member of the committees on protective devices, 1914–16 and 1919–29; standards, 1923–32; and meetings and papers (now technical program), 1926–28. Mr. Hunt is the author of several Institute papers."
"WILLIAM STANTON TWINING (A'05, M' 13) retired engineer, Ambler, Pa., died February 8, 1937. Mr. Twining was born February 20, 1865, near Titusville, Pa., attended Cornell University, and was graduated from Allegheny College in 1887, as a civil engineer. During the 3 following years he remained at Allegheny College as an instructor in chemistry and engineering, and in 1890 entered the railway engineering department of the Thomson-Houston Company at Boston, Mass., where his work consisted of power-station design and construction. In 1901 he was engaged as assistant engineer for the Union Railway Company and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, New York, N. Y., and remained in that position until 1903, when he transferred his affiliation to the Peoples Traction Company, Philadelphia, Pa. In 1905 Mr. Twining was appointed chief engineer of that company and its successor, the Union Traction and Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company, in which position he was in general charge of all engineering work. From 1910 to 1914 he served as engineering manager for the consulting engineering firm of Ford, Bacon, and Davis, New York, N. Y. He then returned to Philadelphia to become the first director of transit of that city. Mr. Twining retired from active service in 1925."

"Synchronous Machines. Synchronous machines are analyzed in 3 papers in this issue. In the first, synchronous-machine theory has been extended to include the effect of armature-circuit capacitance in the general equations for the performance of a salientpole machine (pages 41–8). The second paper presents an extension of the 2-reaction theory of synchronous machines (pages 27–31), The third paper presents a mathematical analysis of the synchronous machine from the point of view of field-distribution theory, a departure from the usual method of considering machine performance by means of circuit theory (pages 49–58)."
"IN AN EFFORT to relieve readers of eyes-train, with its attendant fatigue and discomfort, or worse, ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING introduces with this issue some of the indirect results of extensive research by noted illumination and research authorities in the field of “effective seeing” a hopeful step toward a much-needed “easy-reading page.” This issue is printed on new paper of an improved quality, blended and toned scientifically to provide the foundation for an effective non-glare easyreading page. Typography, too, has been modified in the interests of reader-comfort. Even the ink, which after all makes a periodical out of otherwise blank paper, has been specially compounded to contribute toward the desired results, and in all probability will be improved still further in the future."
"ABOUT 2 years ago a new wideband system for multichannel telephone transmission over coaxial cables was described in an AIEE paper.1 An experimental system has now been installed between New York and Philadelphia. The various tests and trials which are planned for this system have not been carried far enough to justify a formal AIEE technical paper for presentation and discussion. Meanwhile, the considerable interest that has been aroused in the system has led to this brief statement of its principal features and its general technical performance as so far measured, which has been prepared by M. E. Strieby (M'22) carrier transmission research engineer of the Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc., New York, N. Y."
"An investigation of the effect of abrasion upon electrical brush wear is reported in this paper. Tests of the rate of wear of anode and cathode brushes, and of brushes carrying current and those that did not, show that abrasion is an important factor in electrical brush wear."
"To meet the need for lightning protection on low-voltage transmission lines at moderate cost, and particularly for wood-pole lines, a design is presented in this paper that has high insulation strength and uses, in place of a ground wire, a shielding phase conductor with a lightning protector tube. Lightning currents are drained to ground with a minimum number of tubes of low current rating."
"Early installations of 3-phase 4-wire power distribution systems of the multigrounded or common-neutral type in some cases created noise problems involving neighboring telephone circuits. Operating experience, studies of specific situations and comprehensive co-operative research over a period of years have developed means of largely avoiding difficulties of this character. The relative importance of various features of the power and telephone systems which have been found to affect the noise-induction problems involved is discussed here, and the general co-operative procedures most helpful in conversions to, or extensions of, these types of power distribution systems, are outlined."
"An extension of the 2-reaction theory of synchronous machines as developed by R. H. Park is given in this paper for machines having capacitance in the armature circuit. General equations for predetermination of the performance under certain abnormal conditions of machines having balanced 3-phase capacitance in the armature circuit are presented."
"During the past 2 years the AIEE transformer subcommittee∗ has proposed changes in the AIEE transformer standards; this paper is presented to bring these changes before the Institute."
"Accurate control of high currents for resistance welding may be obtained by igniter-type mercury-cathode tubes capable of conducting 7,000 amperes in impulses of from less than 0.01 second to several seconds duration. This paper describes design principles and manufacturing technique for tubes of the sealed-off type."
"In this paper the 2-reaction theory of synchronous machines is extended, for steady-state conditions, to present some new deductions apparently not previously known."
"In this paper a rigorous mathematical analysis of a synchronous machine with solid cylindrical rotor is presented. The analysis embodies a departure from the usual method of considering machine performance by means of circuit theory, and presents an attack from the point of view of field-distribution theory. Such an analysis is desirable, for it provides a definite means of considering the effect of eddy currents in the solid iron rotor."
"Effects of humidity, corona, and mechanical stress on the electrical characteristics of porcelain and glass suspension-insulator units are shown in this paper. Moisture, alone and combined with corona, is found to produce surface deposits which cause hysteresis effects in the power, power factor, and capacitive characteristics, and mechanical stress is found to reduce the power, power factor, and capacitance. The effect of stress is reduced where soft metal is used in place of cement in assembling the unit."
"In this paper data are presented on spark-over values of rod gaps, insulators, bushings, sphere gaps, and solid insulation for a range of spark-over times of approximately from 0.2 to 4 microseconds. The problems of accurate measurement that are involved are also discussed, and a shielded resistance voltage divider is described."
"Increased speed because of reduced inertia and greater torque is obtained from the polyphase directional relay described in this paper. A single cup-like moving element is used in place of multiple disks as used heretofore, the polyphase function being obtained by the use of multiple poles."
"Reclosure of circuit breakers following a fault on a high-voltage transmission line with a minimum of delay in order that synchronous load will not fall out of step is described in this paper. Apparatus that performs a complete operation in approximately 20 cycles on a 60-cycle system may be used to obtain a high degree of service continuity from a single-circuit transmission line."
"Poles are ordinarily considered as rigid struts in designing structures for supporting overhead lines, even in situations where they are not restrained by guys and it is known that movement takes place under variation in loading. This paper points out the importance of making allowance for this factor under certain conditions and gives the theory and practical methods for its solution."
"Continuing a series of papers reporting a study of lightning on transmission lines, the authors present herewith data obtained during 1935 and part of 1936 on 66-, 110-, 132-, and 220-kv lines. Values of lightning current are presented, and the effectiveness of overhead ground wires and low footing resistance in preventing tripouts is shown."
"This paper gives the results of experimental investigations relating to arc characteristics as they apply in commutator flashing. A knowledge of these characteristics is necessary for the application of the theory outlined in a previous paper1 on flashing of commutators by the same author, as well as for the investigation of flashing due to other causes."
"This paper provides a comparison of results of 5 economic studies∗ that were made to determine the economic relationship between conductor sizes and distribution transformer sizes for various load densities and rates of load growth. The progressive method of distribution design, which provides additions rather than replacements, has been found most economical. Increase in load density can be handled most economically by the subdivision of secondary mains and the installation of intermediate transformers. Numbers 4, 3, or 2 conductors and 15-kva transformers should be favored for overhead secondary distribution in residential areas in cities and towns. Rural lines and service to rural communities are not considered in this comparison."
"The results of a series of experiments, in which the processes of contact voltage drop and ring wear in sliding contacts are demonstrated by means of a direct method, are presented in this paper. The results show that the wear of metal-graphite brushes and the rings upon which they operate can be reduced if they be operated in an oxygen-free gas instead of air."
"Bearings for the moving element in watt-hour meters have received considerable study in recent years in order that maintenance might be reduced. The requirements for the bearing, the materials available and their characteristics, lubricants, and the various designs of bearings are discussed in this paper."
"The provision of suitable overcurrent protection for distribution systems at low cost is an important problem, for upon the satisfactory solution of that problem depends the continuity of service of a great many consumers of electric energy; consequently, the relations of a public utility company with its customers also depend upon adequate overcurrent protection. This paper presents a discussion of the various trends in overcurrent protection, with the aim of providing for the distribution engineer some basis for selecting the particular protective system best suited to his particular requirements."
"The well-known expansion theorem of Heaviside applies to circuits whose current-electromotive force relations may be expressed through differential equations, whereas in some networks such as filters and artificial lines, in which the network consists of a repeated pattern or mesh, the relations give what are known as difference equations. These are equations involving the mesh number of the network. The solutions of such networks are given in this paper in the form of expansion theorems similar to Heaviside's expansion theorem and its extensions."
"The cleaning action upon gases of a corona discharge has been known since 1824; however, the technique of electrostatic precipitation has been improved slowly because of the inherent difficulties of the process and the somewhat limited field of its application. With accurately controlled industrial processes and delicate laboratory measurements came the necessary incentive for improving electrostatic precipitation equipment, and recently it has been applied in the field of medicine for the treatment of such maladies as hay fever. The theory of electrostatic precipitation is reviewed briefly in this paper, and a new precipitator is described."
"This paper presents a summary of the results of over 2,000 tests on the dielectric strength of transformer oil and insulating material for impulse, switching, and 60-cycle voltages. From these tests the voltage-time characteristics of the 2 insulations tested may be established over the entire range from a fraction of a microsecond to more than one minute."
"A comprehensive discussion of the (actors affecting the performance of a watt-hour meter is presented in this paper, and the general discussion is applied to a description of the development of a new type of domestic watt-hour meter. Design and performance data on the new meter also are presented."
"Equipment capable of restoring service automatically after temporary interruptions on transmission and distribution systems has been developed to a high degree of effectiveness; however, most of such equipment is suitable only for systems of high capacity, and comparatively little attention has been given to systems of low and intermediate capacities. An automatic service restorer, designed primarily for use on systems of low capacity, is described in this paper, and some data on its operating characteristics are presented."
"It is suggested in this paper that impulse generator voltage waves for commercial testing may be compared not only on the basis of wave shape but also on the basis of relations between circuit constants. The charts and graphs included are intended to show how desirable this is, and they may be used to facilitate both front-of-wave and full-wave testing."
"Letters submitted on engineering education by Albrecht Naeter (Electrical Engineering Department, Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College, Stillwater, OK, USA) and \"the measure of an engineer\" by J. Andrew Douglas (Murphy High School, Mobile, AL, USA) are presented."

"ON August 1, 1936, there was no phase of the Institute work of which I knew so little as I did about the work of the Student Branches. Today there is no phase in which I am more interested, or which I feel is better conducted. A successful Branch must overcome some natural handicaps. If limited to the 2 upper classes, the membership must be completely replaced every 2 years. There are many claims on the students' time. The potential members have had little experience in organization affairs. Active membership is of such short duration that there is little opportunity for the development of leaders. In a Section the average chairman comes to office with several years' experience in Section and committee work, but the Branch chairman seldom has more than one year's training in Branch activity. In the Sections, past-chairmen are a source of inspiration, counsel, and guidance, while in the Branches, the past-chairmen are lost through graduation."
"With the January 1937 issue, ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING presented to its readers the “easy reading” page. This article presents a discussion of the factors that would influence the production of a perfect reading page, and an opinion, founded upon scientific research, concerning this “easy reading” page as an approximation of the theoretical ideal."
"CHARLES LE GEYT FORTESCUE will long be remembered as an engineer well-known for his technical achievements and well-loved for his qualities as a man. Some of his accomplishments have been so outstanding that it seems worth while calling attention to their value and to the extent to which they have been useful in extending human knowledge and lightening the labor of other engineers in his own and succeeding generations."
"A BILLION light-years is the distance to which scientists and astronomers estimate that they will be able to explore the universe when the new 200-inch reflecting-type telescope, largest in the world, is completed on Mt. Palomar, Calif. This is twice the range of the next largest telescope in existence, the 100-inch instrument at Mt. Wilson, Calif. (A light-year is the distance traversed by light in a year and is approximately 6×1012 miles.) Mt. Palomar, which is about 90 miles from Los Angeles, was selected because of its ideal weather conditions and its isolation. In addition to a new observatory to house the huge telescope, the project includes construction of a new 20-mile road, a new community for the operating staff, several smaller domes, power plant, radio station, million-gallon water reservoir, and an airplane landing field. Headquarters of the observatory will be on the campus of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, which institution will supervise its operation."
"Based upon an exact electrical analogy of a mechanical system, a specially constructed electrical computer eliminated many laborious calculations in designing the overhead catenary system for an extensive railroad electrification"
"THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers presents herewith to the membership its fifty-third annual report, for the fiscal year ending April 30, 1937. A general balance sheet showing the condition of the Institute's finances on April 30, 1937, together with other detailed financial statements, is included herein. This report contains a brief summary of the principal activities of the Institute during the year, more detailed information having been published from month to month in ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING."
"GRAPHICAL RECORDING of hysteresis loops or magnetization curves by means of a hysteresigraph is in many instances a much more convenient way of obtaining desired magnetic data than is the usual ballistic method. Unsymmetrical hysteresis loops, for example, may require considerable laborious procedure if obtained in the usual manner, but are easily recorded by some types of hysteresigraphs. The photoelectric hysteresigraph described herein is an instrument which readily records initial magnetization curves or any desired symmetrical or unsymmetrical hysteresis loops."
"SLEPIAN AND LUDWIG'S discovery of the ignitron1 principle of initiating the cathode spot of an arc has been followed by intensive investigation of the factors affecting the design and operation of the ignitron. Many of the design features of the ignitron follow conventional mercury-arc-rectifier practice. The distinguishing feature of the ignitron is the ignitor. An ignitor is an electrode of high resistivity material which is partially immersed in the cathode mercury. On sending a sufficiently large current through the ignitor into the mercury, a cathode spot forms upon the mercury at the ignitor mercury junction. The current to accomplish this varies in an inverse manner with the resistivity of the ignitor so that it is necessary to use relatively high resistivity material for practical ignitors. In practice the ignitor is connected to a suitable source of power with some means of switching so that the arc may be started at the proper time during the interval when the ignitron anode voltage is positive. The most generally used circuit uses a thyratron for controlling the ignitor current as shown in figure 1."
"POTIER REACTANCE is a somewhat fictitious reactance, because it is a combination of reactance, change of saturation, and change of flux form. Nevertheless, it is sometimes a rather useful fictions-cause it can be easily tested, and because it can be used to obtain full load field currents of synchronous machines when only the no-load saturation curve is available. It is also useful for determining effects of saturation on stability."
"THIS PAPER is a description of the characteristics of a new line of station-type autovalve arresters. These arresters are designed to limit the surge voltage to a low value for all types of surges, and at the same time to have high enough 60-cycle breakdown and cut off characteristics to be practically free from trouble due to transient 60-cycle overvoltages."
"THE BETTER relays are made, the better they must be made. This is because better relays enable more economical transmission of power by permitting operation nearer to the stability limits of a system;1 and the nearer to its stability limits a system operates, the more dependence is placed on its relays."
"DURING the past few years rapid progress has been made in the development of distance relay protective schemes, and there are now available a number of various types of distance measuring and directional elements which may be utilized in various combinations to afford the protection desired. In determining the performance of these elements under various fault conditions it would be of great benefit to be able to express the performance of each type of element under a given fault condition in terms of a simple quantity such as the effective line impedance between the relay and the point of fault. Unfortunately it will be found that the performance of certain elements, notably those connected to the unfaulted phases will be affected by changes in system setup and in system capacity. Lewis and Tippet have provided an excellent theoretical treatment of this problem1 which Calabrese has supplemented by a study of the effect of wye-delta and delta-wye transformers interposed between the relay and the fault.2"
"In 1934 tests were started to investigate the important factors influencing the life of oil-impregnated paper at high voltage. Last year we described the techniques developed to date in this investigation. The present paper presents all data taken on specimens tested under a gas pressure of 200 pounds per square inch and compared all results obtained with one commercial mineral oil and one commercial wood-pulp paper for 3 conditions of gas pressure. The results indicate that under the conditions of these tests there is no correlation between dielectric loss and electrical life and that gas-free specimens are superior to any specimens saturated with gas up to 200 pounds per square inch pressure."
"In order to make possible the prediction of the attenuation and distortion of lightning waves on transmission lines an equation is proposed that relates the change of shape of a traveling wave to the corona loss on the line at normal operating frequency. Results obtained by computation from this formula are compared with experimental results of various investigators."
"WHILE the unsaturated synchronous machine is in general well understood, the effects of saturation upon its performance are still subject to discussion. Knowledge on the influence of saturation is important because of power-angle relations, steady-state stability limits, and excitation requirements. The problem of saturation may be approached in several ways. One method1 is to determine empirical factors which modify characteristics of the unsaturated machine, the saturation factors being single average values for a group of machines. A second way2 leads to the introduction of equivalent reactances which allow calculation of the effects of saturation on small load changes about an initial operating point. Third, there is the derivation3 of saturated synchronous reactances to be used in the investigation of power-angle curves and maximum power."
"ON THIS and the following 45 pages appear discussions submitted for publication, and approved by the technical committees, on papers presented at the sessions on communication, electric welding, electronics, instruments and measurements, power distribution, selected subjects, and synchronous machinery at the 1937 AIEE winter convention, New York, N.

"Induction-Motor Constants. The constants of single-phase induction motors usually are computed by means of polyphase formulas, with special adaptations to single-phase motor construction. A method of calculating electrical constants has been developed specifically for the single-phase capacitor motor, but is equally applicable to other types of single-phase motors (pages 333–8)."
"AN almost universal characteristic of the human family is the desire “to come together” — “con venio” — “convene.” Twice in the last month have I seen this demonstrated: once in New York at the winter convention of the AIEE; and again in a far different way at Colon, Panama, where the picturesque natives of the Isthmus dropped every regular occupation that they might fittingly celebrate the annual carnival just prior to the beginning of Lent. I am told that the term “carnival” is derived from 2 Latin words, vale (farewell) and carnus (meat). In gay, picturesque, and sometimes ludicrous costumes, by parades through colorfully decorated streets, and enlivened by bands, the throng bade a merry farewell to meat."
"THE SCIENCE OF SEEING differs somewhat from the science of vision with which most of us are generally familiar. The science of vision is a relatively old subject and deals with the eyes, their functions and limitations. The science of seeing, however, treats the human being as a seeing machine, particularly as regards its behavior, efficiency, and welfare."
"The application of technical advances to the welfare of mankind is held to be the true contribution of engineering to civilization, rather than the advances themselves; power together with tools to use it, and not power alone, led to American industrial development. More than merely the availability of large amounts of power is necessary in order that standards of living may be raised, and maintained."
"Higher armature peripheral speeds, better insulation, and improved ventilation of railway motors, together with the rapid development of Diesel-electric equipment for railroads, have made necessary a revision of the AIEE Standards For Railway Motors. The new standards have been adopted as “American Tentative Standards” pending Further experience with the new types of machinery covered by them."
"A brief review of the fundamentals of the lightning protection problem, and of the various common methods of protecting power transmission lines against lightning, their comparative merits, and their relative costs."
"In this paper the carbon arc is considered in its 3 characteristic forms, the low intensity arc, the high intensity arc, and the flame arc. The influence of arc current on the energy emission is discussed in relation to each of the 3 types, as well as the effects of variation in arc voltage. The discussion covers characteristics which should be given consideration in order to make most effective application of the various types of arcs."
"OUR PROBLEM is to find the way in which the currents and voltages vary in a general linear a-c network connected to a single adjustable branch, when the current of that branch is adjusted under some given restriction. In a general linear network, each branch has a fixed impedance; and the impressed voltages and currents (of which there may be any number, but usually is only one) are also fixed.∗ The impressed voltages and currents are supposed sinusoidal and of the same frequency; and we are concerned only with the steady state. So all voltages and currents are sinusoidal and may be represented analytically by complex numbers and graphically by plane vectors."
"THE cross field theory and the revolving field theory are the 2 commonly accepted bases for analytieal treatment of the single phase squirrel cage induction motor. For the purpose of quantitative analysis as well as to explain why and how the motor runs, the first mentioned theory resolves fluxes, voltages, and currents into components in 2 axes fixed with reference to the stator; whereas the second theory resolves the flux into 2 rotating components — one rotating in a positive direction at synchronous speed, and the other rotating in a negative direction at synchronous speed."
"This paper is the first of 2 papers dealing with the development of equations for determining the characteristic constants of single-phase induction motors. It is intended to present in the complete paper a unified tabulation of formulas consistent in symbols with those used in the paper which I presented at the midwinter convention of the AIEE, New York, January 28-February 1, 1929."
"KNOWLEDGE of transient oscillations of synchronous machines is of considerable importance because of the application of such information to studies on system load changes which may lead to loss of synchronism, to voltage fluctuations, or to hunting. Although in many instances very large angular swings must be taken into account, for many investigations only relatively small angular swings are considered. In this latter class are problems of determining the effects of saturation on load angle, angular variations with attendant current pulsations for variable torque loads, and the prediction of stability under large load changes as determined from studies of loads causing small displacements."
"IT HAS been shown that the method of circular loci may be conveniently applied to obtain the variation of currents and voltages when self-impedances are changed in various types of circuits operated at constant frequency. Part I1 dealt with this problem in a Y-Y connection and part II2 in a Δ-Δ connection. In both of these papers current equations were given involving all the impedances and voltages of the most general types of Y-Y and Δ-Δ circuits and required only the substitution of numerical values to obtain the locus of any current or voltage existing in the system. The same treatment will now be applied to the Δ-Y connection."
"CORE LOSS in laminated structures subjected to an alternating magnetomotive force is made up of a hysteresis loss and an eddy-current loss. In modern power transformers the eddy-current loss is approximately 1/4 to 1/3 of the total loss."
"ABSOLUTE formulas for the mutual inductance of coaxial solenoids have been derived by Nagaoka, Terezawa, and Olshausen. These all give the mutual inductance as a combination of 4 integrals — 2 positive and 2 negative — each of which is a function of one of the 4 distances measured between an end of one solenoid and an end of the other. The expressions for these terms involve elliptic integrals of all 3 kinds, and numerical computations of their values are exacting."
"THE analysis of circuits containing copper-oxide rectifiers is based upon the selection of a proper representation of the variable impedance of the rectifier element. In this analysis, the element is replaced by 2 constant resistances effective during the 2 directions of current flow through the rectifier. On the basis of this representation, an equivalent circuit is developed, which is a modification of the usual perfect rectifier circuit. The method is illustrated by analyzing circuits in which the loads consist of resistance and inductance and of resistance and capacitance. The computed results are then compared with observations made by an oscillograph."
"THE HEATING of passenger cars electrically together with the additional energy required for traction purposes when cold weather prevails cause increases in operating expenses which are of great importance on the Illinois Central Railroad where power is purchased."
"AN EXACT method of calculating the capacitance of a parallel-plate air condenser, taking into account its fringing effect, has been suggested by J. J. Thomson1 and more completely worked out by A. E. H. Love.2 The purpose of this paper is to promote familiarity with this mathematical technique by making it more readily accessible to American engineers. In addition to the exact method, a number of approximate methods are included."
"Discussion and author's closure of a paper by John Fies published in the October 1936 issue, pages 1060–74, and presented for oral discussion at the general technical session of the AIEE South West District meeting, Dallas, Texas, October 26, 1936."
"Termed by President A. M. MacCutcheon, “one of the busiest, most stimulating, and most interesting” conventions that he had ever attended, the Institute's 1937 winter convention drew to a close with a total registration of 1,165. Perhaps one of the busiest attendants at the convention was President MacCutcheon himself. An unusually large number of committee meetings was held, and for the first time the board of directors met on 2 successive afternoons during convention week."

"D-C Transformers. Various methods have been proposed for transforming voltage on d-c systems without using a motor-generator set. Although little practical use has been made of the device, the d-c transformer using grid-controlled mercury-arc rectifiers for commutating the direct current is one of the more promising of the¶ systems thus far devised. The general theory of d-c transformers is discussed in a paper in this issue, and 2 new types of d-c transformers using grid-controlled mercury-arc rectifiers are described (pages 1372–8)."
"Grand Coulee Dam, now under construction on the Columbia River in the State of Washington, will create a 150-mile lake From which irrigation water for more than a million acres of land will be pumped by part of the power to be generated at the dam. This article describes the purposes of the project, which will not be completed in its entirety for half a century, and the present status of construction of the dam."
"Another in a series of annual reports presented by the chairman of National Research Council's committee on electrical insulation, this article summarizes some of the principal advances in research work on gaseous, liquid, and solid dielectrics during the past year. References are included to both fundamental scientific studies and practical research under service conditions."
"Dealing with the annual incomes of engineers engaged in both engineering and nontechnical work, this sixth article1 of a series reporting a survey of engineering employment conducted by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics presents data, derived from reports of 52,589 engineers, tending to show that engineers engaged in technical work reach their maximum earning capacity later than those in nonengineering endeavors."
"Much of the noise present in electrical motors is due to poor manufacture. Careless or inaccurate manufacturing methods often show up in some manner as uneven air gaps, loose bearings, brush noise, or loose rotor bars."
"THE REACTANCE of a power transformer is materially changed when connection is made to taps of different voltages. This can be computed for concentric, core-type transformers by dividing the winding into a concentric component and an interleaved component according to the method of H. O. Stephens.1"
"CAREFUL RESEARCH into the nature of the metallic state has yet to discover, with any certainty, its essential quality, says L. R. van Wert, lecturer on metallurgy, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass., in an article of the above title published in the October 1937 issue of Mining and Metallurgy, pages 453–8."
"This paper presents 2 new types of d-c transformers using grid-controlled mercury-arc rectifiers. These transformers perform the same function on a d-c system as does the usual transformer on an a-c system. One type of d-c transformer which is discussed has a constant-current output characteristic, while the other has a constant-potential output. The theory of operation and operating characteristics are described and oscillograms taken on a small unit are shown."
"The method of circular loci is applied to the problem of 2 transformers operating in parallel. It is shown that with comparatively little computation the variation of current in either transformer or the ratio of the 2 currents may be obtained as a function of the load impedance or the ratio of transformation. A numerical problem is given to illustrate a typical application."
"PROBABLY no other industry in the world offers the variety and scope for mechanical engineering that the electrical business does, according to the article “The Young Mechanical Engineer in the Electrical Industry,” by A. R. Stevenson, Jr. (A'20) and E. E. Parker, which was published in Mechanical Engineering for October 1937, pages 725–31."
"WATER-WHEEL GENERATORS without damper windings under capacitive load may have abnormally high voltages developed across their terminals at limes of unsymmetrical short circuits. These voltages are due to 2 causes. First, the difference in permeance of the magnetic circuit in the direct and quadrature axes produces, under unsymmetrical short circuits, distorted voltages which have high peak values even if there is no capacitance connected to the machine. Second, the capacitance of the line and the reactance of the machine resonate or partially resonate and produce still greater distortion of the voltages on the sound phase. The phenomenon associated with single-phase short circuits with no connected capacitive load, has been analyzed by Doherty and Nickle.1 The present paper is concerned with the effect of the capacitive load and an analysis of the factors involved in this phenomenon. Consideration is given to the system conditions under which these harmful voltages may arise and the remedial measures which may be applied for their elimination."

"E. E. DREESE (M'25) professor of electrical engineering and chairman of the electrical engineering department of The Ohio State University, Columbus, has been appointed chairman of the Institute's committee on basic sciences for the year 1937–38. Professor Dreese was born at Edmore Mich., September 10, 1895, and was graduated from the University of Michigan in 1920 with the degree of bachelor of science in electrical engineering. In the following year he was appointed to the electrical engineering faculty of the University of Michigan as an instructor. At the same time he enrolled in the graduate school and in 1925 received the degree of master of science in electrical engineering, following which he was appointed chief engineer of the Lincoln Electric Company, Cleveland, Ohio. Professor Dreese remained with that company for 5 years, and during that time received the honorary degree of electrical engineer from the University of Michigan. In 1930 he was appointed professor of electrical engineering at The Ohio State University and made chairman of the department of electrical engineering. He is an active participant in the local affairs of the AIEE Columbus Section, and has been secretary (1933–34) and chairman (1934–35) of that Section; moreover, for the last 2 years he has been active in committee work of the Institute. He has been a member of the committee on basic sciences (formerly electrophysics) since 1935, and is entering his second year of service on the committees on education and student Branches. Professor Dreese is the author of 2 papers presented before the Institute. He is a member of the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education, Tau Beta Pi, Eta Kappa Nu, and Sigma Xi."
"HENRY WRIGHT FISHER (A'95, M'01, F'12, member for life) retired consulting engineer for the General Cable Corporation, Perth Amboy, N. J., died near Asheville, N. C., October 7, 1937. Mr. Fisher was born January 31, 1861, at Youghal, Ireland, and was graduated from Cornell University with the degree of mechanical engineer in the class of 1888. After graduation he held one or 2 minor positions before joining the staff of the Standard Underground Cable Company, remaining with that firm until 1927, when it became a part of the General Cable Corporation and he was retained on the engineering staff of the new organization. He was chief electrical engineer of the Standard Underground Cable Company from 1889 to 1915, manager of the lead cable and rubber works from 1915 to 1923, technical director of electrical engineering from 1923 to 1927, and for one year thereafter with the General Cable Corporation, and consulting engineer from 1928 to 1930, when he retired."

"Federal Power Commission Hearing. — The Federal Power Commission will hold a public hearing on November 15, in Washington, D. C., on the application of the Pacific Gas & Electric Co., San Francisco, for a preliminary permit to construct six major hydroelectric developments on the North Fork of the Feather River, having an aggregate proposed installed capacity of 368,000 kva. The company at present owns and operates the only three hydroelectric plants on the North Fork of the Feather River. These are known as Big Bend, Bucks Creek, and Caribou plants. The six proposed plants are planned to be built between the Caribou plant and the Big Bend plant. The difference in elevation between these two points is 2,072 feet and it is this difference in elevation or head of the river which is to be developed through the proposed construction. On the date of the application, the company is shown as operating 39 hydroelectric plants, two operated under lease, with a total installed capacity of 1,011,285 horsepower and 8 steam plants with a total installed capacity of 426,608 horsepower."

"What is the appropriate attitude for engineers to take toward economic problems, as individuals and through the AIEE? In response to a request from the Institute's publication committee, a noted engineer and educator here gives his answer to that question."
"NO DOUBT you are all accustomed to thinking of atoms as objects — very small objects, of course — which are endowed with weight. I can say that with perfect safety to an audience of engineers and physicists; but indeed it can be said with safety to any audience — I mean, of course, any audience literate enough to attach any meaning at all to such a word as “atom.” It may be that philosophers of the past have imagined weightless atoms — I am not historian enough to deny that, nor to affirm it; but if such have ever been invented, they have remained quite outside the currents of modern thought. For us, weight is a property which we attribute to the atom. Since this is, after all, a professional audience, I will now change over to that other word which many people have such difficulty in distinguishing from “weight”: I will say that mass is a property which we attribute to the atom. In a way, that is a negative statement. It means that we do not hope to explain mass in terms of something more fundamental; it means that we accept mass as being itself so fundamental that even the elementary particles have it. When I say “elementary particles,” I am still referring in part to the atoms, though it is a somewhat careless usage to do so; but I am referring also to electrons both positive and negative, to protons, to alpha-particles, to nuclei — to all the particles, in effect, of which the atoms are built up. Also I ought to include the corpuscles of light, but this lecture will be quite long enough if I leave them almost unmentioned. All of these particles, then, are endowed with mass; each of them has a characteristic mass of its own, which we do not attempt to explain, but which we do try to measure as closely as we can."
"THE engineer's influence in modern society may be pictured by considering him as an energetic surgeon operating in a large and effective way upon the social organism. He is skilled in the use of instruments, but generally quite ignorant and unconcerned about the nerves and endurance of his suffering patient. His one-sided interest in tools and techniques begins in the engineering college where his teachers are content if he learns technology. Later, when he comes to apply the knife of modern science to the vitals of society, does he inflict needless pain? Does he suffer too? But can it truly be said that the average engineering graduate is uneducated? The academic-minded scholars may say he is, but that proves nothing. These scholars have forced a liberal education upon our physicians and lawyers. After all, the captains of industry employ the engineers. They might tell what training leads to long-range success. What do they say about our modern engineering education?"
"ENGINEERING was originally the despised child of science. At the time of its birth, which occurred in a period of invention, it was not very welcome. In the second stage of its development, that of curriculum building which followed through a concurrent period of commercialization of inventions, many mistakes were made; and now since the beginning of the twentieth century, when it has been accepted the tremendous development of new ideas brought about by research in both colleges and industry have so swamped the all-inclusive efforts of curriculum builders that there is a threat of filial ingratitude. No matter how great the pressures are to limit time devoted to this instruction, it seems to be a false step to subordinate the importance of instruction in physics and likewise its financial support."
"AS IT commonly is used, the slide rule serves as a set of tables and as a multiplying device. As the latter it also is used in performing the inverse operation division. By combining the 2 functions one may perform such operations as division by a sine, or multiplication by the square of a tangent. For many users the technique of slide rule operation goes no farther than such simple combinations."
"INVESTIGATIONS to ascertain to what extent consumers of electricity in rural areas of England are protected from risk of shock with methods of earthing at present in use, and what changes in practice might be desirable, with special reference to “protective multiple earthing,” were reported in a paper by H. G. Taylor entitled “The Use of Protective Multiple Earthing and Earth-Leakage Circuit Breakers in Rural Areas” which was read before The (British) Institution of Electrical Engineers, April 14, 1937. The term “protective multiple earthing” as used here means the connection to earth of the neutral conductor at some or all consumers' premises and the connection of metal frameworks to the neutral, using a separate insulated earth-continuity conductor that is run through the house and connected to all metal-work of appliances, to a separate earth, and to the neutral service conductor on the service side of the fuses at the meter board."
"Development of radiobroadcasting and reception has been paralleled by development and extensive use of devices that may cause interference with reception. The purpose of this paper is to review several factors of particular interest to the electric utilities, who supply service to both the radio and many of the interference sources. A relatively new form of interference effect — external cross modulation — is described. In conclusion, a parallel is drawn to the familiar co-ordination activities on wired communication lines and electric power systems."
"THE LIGHTNING-STROKE generator has made possible the investigation of lightning-stroke phenomena in the laboratory.1,2 This paper deals with the fundamental aspect of the problem, particularly with the characteristics of the lightning-stroke channel. The data and findings here presented reveal further the nature of the channel core and of the resulting column.3 Field observations are also indicated for comparison, to enhance the value of the laboratory investigation."
"This is a study of the current, voltage, and power values throughout a simple transmission system when machines are operating out of step. The investigation was made to determine the proper relay protection for some large frequency changers which supply power to an electrified railroad. The object was to find means for protecting machines that had already fallen out of step or, if possible, to prevent them from falling out due to overload."
"IN A PREVIOUS PAPER1 the solution for the ideal alternator under symmetrical terminal conditions was developed. In this paper the application of the equations developed in this previous paper are used, together with symmetrical components of currents, to obtain the solution of currents in the armature and field circuits of an alternator under unsymmetrical fault conditions. These equations and solutions are applied to a 3-phase alternator having a line-to-ground and a line-to-line fault condition, under various conditions. Oscillograms and calculated graphs are compared to check the method used in this solution, and excellent results are obtained. Due to the inclusion of resistance simultaneously in the armature and field circuits, the frequency of the harmonics in the circuits are seen to be somewhat different than usually given under less approximate assumptions. Also, the effect of resistance is more closely determined by this method of solution."
"A COMMON procedure in the design of single-phase induction motors involves the determination of a stator winding to yield a desired maximum torque, followed by a check on motor performance. Yet in spite of the importance of the maximum torque value, little can be found in the technical literature concerning methods of predicting its magnitude, outside of those wherein the slip at which maximum torque occurs is substituted in the motor equations and the resulting maximum torque determined.1 Inspection and trial from motor equations or the circle diagram are possible, but tedious, methods of approach."
"Two test methods for the determination of stray load losses in d-c machines are described. Application of the loading-back principle permits measurements to a high degree of accuracy. A technique is developed for stabilizing no-load losses so that consistency of results is improved. Results of tests of several machines are presented, together with an analysis of the relation of loss to operating conditions of the machine."

"Radiobroadcasting. Although radiobroadcasting stations in the United States operate on frequencies assigned so as to provide service to listeners throughout the country, practical limitations make impossible good reception on every one of the 100 frequency channels in the band of medium wave lengths for any one listener (pages 666–70). Frequencies of 30 or more megacycles per second have certain characteristics that make them particularly suitable for local broadcasting, and essential for television with present standards, but working frequencies in this region by no means are unlimited. Because such waves are limited in range almost to optical paths, they are unlikely to replace the medium-frequency waves now used for broadcasting over large areas (pages 662–6)."
"FROM my limited viewpoints, a primary activity of other Sections is enthusiastically to receive and delightfully entertain the president. At those meetings where the president was an invited guest, but not the primary speaker, there was the greatest opportunity to learn what the Section was doing “to advance the theory and practice of electrical engineering, and the allied arts and sciences, and to maintain a high professional standing among the members.” A meeting each year with a national officer or officers is most desirable, not only that the Section may learn of national activities, but even more that the national officers may be informed as to the Section's viewpoints. Several times this year, the president joined in a luncheon meeting with a Section's executive committee. These meetings were very profitable."
"FOR an industry that manufactures and uses as large a variety of apparatus as the electrical industry, the problem of the development of standards is a tremendously important one. The purposes of standards are 2-fold: In the first place, they aid in the manufacture of products that are more uniform; in the second place, they form a basis that enables purchasers to orjtain bids for new apparatus on a comparable basis."
"Data obtained from 35,559 engineers by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics in its survey of the engineering profession indicate that the degree of economic security among professional engineers, as evidenced by possession of an employment contract covering some period of time, or by pension privileges, was negligible. This is the fourth∗ in a series of articles reporting the results of the Bureau's survey."
"Use of ultrahigh frequencies for educational broadcasting has been thought to offer attractive possibilities because of the supposedly almost unlimited number of channels; however, the demands of other radio services, particularly television, may be expected to congest this newly opened region. Ultrahigh-frequency waves behave somewhat like light waves, and give reliable and steady communication over short distances. The 6-megacycle band width required for television can be accommodated only in this region, but short range precludes, for the present, coverage of rural areas with these frequencies."
"To give the radiobroadcast listener maximum service is an important problem in which the frequencies available, characteristics of the receiving set, phenomena of transmission of radio waves, area to be served, and density of population in the area must be considered. Broadcast stations in the United States are of 2 main classes, clear channel and duplicated channel, and are allocated in frequency to prevent interference between stations in the same area. Short-wave broadcasting has additional limitations because of natural phenomena."
"THE SUBSTITUTION of chlorine for hydrogen in the hydrocarbon molecule produces marked effect not only on the physical and chemical properties, but on the electrical characteristics as well. The compounds so produced present to the electrical engineer a new type of insulating liquid which eliminates many of the problems heretofore inevitably associated with the use of mineral oil. It is the object of this paper to demonstrate the dielectric strength characteristics of such synthetic liquids both alone and in combination with cellulosic insulation."
"FOR many years, the insulation strength of power transformers and other electrical equipment was determined chiefly by the performance in service. When failures occurred, the insulation was made heavier at the points of weakness, and gradually the number of weak points was reduced in the particular lines of equipment and ratings involved. When new lines or ratings were initiated, operating experience was frequently necessary to perfect the design. Little information was available regarding the insulation strength of equipment under impulse conditions, and there was practically no selected co-ordination between the equipment strength and the performance of surge protective equipment."
"A quantitative investigation of the surge protective requirements of distribution systems and the power frequency voltage requirements of protectors for these systems, has been made which leads to the conclusions that:"
"This paper presents, from the viewpoint of the engineer who plans and operates electric power systems, the application logic or theory and the performance results with various forms of spill gaps, for the protection of circuits and equipment from lightning, and the selection of insulation levels co-ordinated with this type of protection."
"THE PERFORMANCE of current interrupting devices on systems is dependent not only on the characteristics of the device itself but also on the characteristics of the system. The voltage rating of the system and the connections at the time of fault have considerable influence on the recovery voltage and in turn on the application of the interrupting device. For example, the last oil circuit breaker to open must be capable of interrupting current under extreme system recovery conditions, while a deion protector tube always has at least the line section on which it is applied, connected at the time of clearing. This means that in considering broadly the current interruption problem it is necessary to have a knowledge of voltage recovery characteristics for a large number of system conditions. Tests can be made for particular system conditions, but this is expensive and it is difficult to obtain data for all possible combinations of faults and system connections. A general analysis taking into account all the factors makes calculations practically impossible, and on account of the complexity, the human factor cannot be overlooked."
"A general-purpose wide-range high-precision vibrationmeasuring instrument must embody several fundamental design requirements which determine the useful frequency range, the accuracy of measurement, the intensity of vibration to which it can be applied, and the effect of the instrument on the vibrating body."
"AS A RESULT of a great deal of operating experience and from a survey of the then current practice as regards insulation of high-tension equipment, it began to be evident some 9 years ago that too little, if any, attention had been paid to co-ordination of insulation in power systems. Apparatus was being built to specifications which were primarily formulated on a 60-cycle basis, with consideration given mainly to the ability of the apparatus to withstand 60-cycle voltages and almost no consideration to impulse strength. Further, very little consideration was given to insulation margins between the different types of apparatus used on the same system voltage. This was first brought to the attention of the membership of the AIEE in 2 papers presented some 9 years ago."
"THIS REPORT has been written to present the agreed upon impulse and 60-cycle flashover values for rod gaps and suspension line insulators, together with a method of making correction for variation in humidity. The laboratory work and correlation upon which these data are based was done by the subcommittee on correlation of laboratory data∗ of the joint EEINEMA committee on insulation co-ordination. The joint committee authorized the publication in ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING of this work through a paper sponsored by the AIEE subcommittee on lightning and insulators. This makes the information more generally available to the the industry for use in connection with the general problem of insulation co-ordination."
"THIS SUBJECT of insulation co-ordination has been an active one for the past 10 years or so. It was initially presented and discussed in 1928.1 Since then, the subject was taken up by practically all groups interested in the transmission problem including designers and operators of electric systems. As the study of the problem gathered headway, the need for further investigation work became quickly apparent. A great number of individual researches were thus started. All of them although closely related were not entirely coordinated. Each of them, however, in its own way, arrived at a solution of all, or of a part of the problem of co-ordinating the insulation strength of the electric system."
"A historical review of advances in the design of highspeed cathode-ray oscillographs and in particular a description of the development, performance, and application of a new type oscillograph is presented in this paper. The new instrument embodies a sealed-glass, high-vacuum, hot-cathode, cathode-ray tube for operation at 15,000 volts."
"A DIRECT METHOD1 of balancing is generally possible for any type of rotor provided it can be run in a special fixture for the measurements. However, some rotors due to large size or other restrictions can be run only on their permanent mountings and balancing usually requires more or less “trial and error” testing. On the other hand, certain rotors of the first group that are small in size and may be run in special fixtures, impose unusual obstacles which make it difficult to apply the well-known principles to produce a rational method of dynamic balancing. This paper is devoted to a description of the solution of such a balancing problem."
"THE GENERAL purpose of isolating machinery is to reduce the amount of noise and vibration transmitted to the structure in which the machine is housed, or to adjoining structures. The general subject of isolation and isolation materials is receiving increasing attention with the tendency to speed up machinery. Machine designers recognize the fact that increased speed has resulted in troublesome vibration problems that previously had not reached “nuisance” or “damage” levels. The great majority of manufacturing tools are inherently unbalanced. To design a balanced drop hammer, loom, punch press or automatic machine is not feasible. In such cases the use of isolation material becomes a necessity."
"Several recent developments in cable, joints, reservoir layout, and installation are incorporated in the 4 66-kv single-conductor oil-filled underground lines being installed in Chicago in 1936–37. The main results are economies and simplification. The emergency ratings of the lines are 115,000 kva in summer and 135,000 kva in winter."
"THIS PAPER is presented to review the work of the transformer subcommittee in setting up standards for the insulation strength of transformers. An effort will be made to present the steps in the development of the insulation co-ordination problem in regard to transformers and to clarify certain points on which misunderstandings have arisen. The present insulation strength standards and tests will be given so that the margin between the protective level and insulation strength as demonstrated by test may be given proper consideration."
"A DISTINCTLY industrial flavor was one of the more attractive features of the AIEE North Eastern District meeting held May 5–7 at Buffalo, N. Y. Supplementing and giving point to 2 special informal papers that were devoted to a discussion and explanation of current trends in the design and application of the electrical equipment that is playing so vital a part in modern steelmill electrification, was a correlated inspection trip through the new 72-inch continuous hot- and cold-strip mill of the Bethlehem Steel Company at nearby Lackawanna."

"Let us recall a scene at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphiain 1876. Across a room had been strung wires connecting crude instruments, at one end of the room a transmitter and at the other end of the room a receiver. Dam Pedro, Emperor of Brazil, takes up the receiver and listens while Alexander Graham Bell speaks into the transmitter. The Emperor, astonished at hearing Mr. Bell's voice in the receiver, exclaims in amazement, “My God, it talks.”"
"At the high radio frequencies, filters and transformers become difficult to construct from conventional electrical coils and condensers, on account of the small sizes of the elements, the large effects of the interconnecting windings and the low ratios of reactance to resistance realizable in coils. It is shown in this paper that selective filters and wide-band transformers can be constructed using transmission lines and condensers as elements. The ratio of reactance to resistance in these elements can be made very high; consequently very selective filters and transformers with small losses, can be constructed. The effect of the distributed nature of the elements is taken account of in the design equations and methods are described for obtaining single-band filters and transformers. Experimental measurements of such filters and transformers are shown. The experimental loss curve is shown of a coaxial filter used in the Provincetown-Green Harbor short-wave radio circuit for the purpose of connecting a transmitter and receiver to the same antenna."
"The theorem of this paper gives four-terminal representation of ladder networks satisfying a prescribed condition on the side impedances, in terms of the three parameters specifying the network connected as a transducer, the driving-point impedance between short-circuited transducer terminal pairs, and an impedance ratio involving the side impedances only. This mode of representation has a special advantage in applications to electric railway networks in that the transducer parameters which alone involve the ladder shunt impedances (under the stated conditions) may be calculated in a relatively simple fashion, and extensive networks reduced to manageable form. The theorem is stated and proved, and its applications are sketched in some detail."
"No doubt you are all accustomed to thinking of atoms as objectsvery small objects, of course-which are endowed with weight. I can say that with perfect safety to an audience of engineers and physicists; but indeed it can be said with safety to any audienceI mean, of course, any audience literate enough to attach any meaning at all to such a word as “atom.”"
"This paper discusses a receiving system employing sharp vertical-plane directivity, capable of being steered to meet the varying angles at which short radio waves arrive at a receiving location. The system is the culmination of some four years effort to determine the degree to which receiving antenna directivity may be carried to increase the reliability of short-wave transatlantic telephone circuits. The system consists of an end-on array of antennas, of fixed directivity, whose outputs are combined in phase for the desired angle. The antenna outputs are conducted over coaxial transmission lines to the receiving building where the phasing is accomplished by means of rotatable phase shifters operating at intermediate frequency. These phase shifters, one for each antenna, are geared together, and the favored direction in the vertical plane may be steered by rotating the assembly. Several sets of these phase shifters are paralleled, each set constituting a separately steerable branch. One of these branches serves as an exploring or monitoring circuit for determining the angles at which waves are arriving. The remaining branches may then be set to receive at these angles. The several receiving branches have common automatic gain control and thus provide a diversity on an angle basis. To obtain the full benefit of the angular resolution afforded by the sharp directivity, the different transmission times, corresponding to the different angles, are equalized by audio delay networks, before combining in the final output."
"Modern Theater Loud Speakers and their Deoelopment.1 C. FLANNAGAN, R. WOLF, and W. C. JONES. Although many of the basic ideas involved in the operation of present-day loud speakers were conceived during the early stages of the development of the telephone, it was not until the advent of the vacuum tube amplifier that these principles were applied to the design of structures capable of delivering sufficient acoustical power to be audible throughout a room or auditorium. Having reached this stage, however, the developments that culminated in the sound reproducing systems employed with present-day sound pictures came in rapid succession."
"Your country is advancing industrially and commercially with tremendous strides. Adequate telephone communication is of such great importance under these conditions that I felt a general statement as to methods in process of being applied to the plant of the Bell System would be interesting and possibly helpful. I am fully aware that, in some or even many respects, your problems will differ from ours. Much of what I have presented may, therefore, serve only to suggest research and development to meet your own requirements. Perhaps also, in some small way, this statement of progress in communication may stimulate research and_development in other industries and services."
"The general theory of coaxial pairs was dealt with in an article on “The Electromagnetic Theory of Coaxial Transmission Lines and Cylindrical Shields” by S. A. Schelkunoff (B. S. T. J., Oct., 1934). The present paper considers a specific aspect of the general theory, namely, crosstalk. Formulae for the crosstalk are developed in terms of the distributed mutual impedance, the constants of the transmission lines and the terminal impedances. Some limiting cases are given special consideration. The theory is then applied to a few special types of coaxial structures studied experimentally and a close agreement is shown between the results of calculations and of laboratory measurements. If the outer members of coaxial pairs are complicated structures rather than solid cylindrical shells, the crosstalk formulae still apply but the mutual impedances and the transmission constants which are involved in these formulae must be determined experimentally since these quantities cannot always be calculated with sufficient accuracy. The crosstalk between coaxial pairs with solid outer conductors rapidly decreases with increasing frequency while the crosstalk between unshielded balanced pairs increases. In the low frequency range there is less crosstalk between such balanced pairs than between coaxial pairs but at high frequencies the reverse is true. The diminution of crosstalk between coaxial pairs with increasing frequency is caused by an ever increasing shielding action furnished by the outer conductors of the pairs. Finally, crosstalk in long lines using coaxial conductors is discussed and the conclusion is reached that, unlike the case of the balanced structure, the far-end crosstalk imposes a more severe condition than the near-end crosstalk in two-way systems which involve more than two coaxial conductors."
"This paper describes an improved method of recording sound magnetically on a steel tape, similar in principle to that of the Poulsen telegraphone. In the latter a longitudinal magnetic pattern of the voice current is imprinted on a steel wire by drawing it rapidly past recording pole pieces. The high speed used by Poulsen and subsequent investigators has been directly and indirectly a limiting factor in the application of magnetic recording to commercial uses. The system here described makes use of perpendicular magnetization. This method makes it possible, with suitable equalization, to obtain a substantially uniform frequency-response characteristic up to 8000 cycles per second with a tape speed of only 16 inches per second. In many cases a speed of 8 inches per second is adequate for recording speech. At the same time the ratio of signal to background noise has been substantially increased. The decrease in efficiency resulting from the use of perpendicular instead of longitudinal magnetization is offset to a great extent by the use of a better design and construction of the pole-pieces and a more suitable recording medium. The recording medium is a steel tape having a thickness of about 1.0 to 2.0 mils (0.025 to 0.051 mm.) and a width of about 50 mils (1.3 mm.)."
"The problem investigated is the determination of two finite networks such that, when connected in parallel, they will have a constant resistance at all frequencies. The admittance of any network may be written as the ratio of two polynomials in frequency. A network to be one of a constant resistance pair must have certain restrictions imposed on its admittance. In case the two networks are both filters of negligible dissipation, the expression for the input conductance of each may be written from a knowledge of the required loss characteristic. The poles of the expression for the conductance are then found. They will be identical for the two networks. The networks are then built up by synthesis from those poles of the conductance which have negative real parts, these corresponding to real network elements. The methods which have been developed for this last process are described in detail."
"Evolution of a simple laboratory technique for the assay of materials proposed for use in the preservation of wood is reported in this paper. This test involves a measurement of the actual decay resistance of the treated wood. Included are a resumé of the limitations imposed by current test-methods and a discussion of the adaptations of this new technique to the numerous variables inherent in laboratory simulations of outdoor exposure."
"Energy losses in ferromagnetic materials subject to alternating fields have long been considered as due solely to hysteresis and eddy currents. However, at the low flux densities encountered in certain communication apparatus, a further loss is observed which has been variously termed “residual,” “magnetic viscosity,” or “square law hysteresis.” The search for an explanation of this loss has led to precise measurements of hysteresis loops with a vacuum ballistic galvanometer, and of a.-c. losses with inductance bridges. From these results, it appears that that part of the a.-c. effective resistance of a coil on a ferromagnetic core which is proportional to the coil current is strictly identified with the hysteresis loop area as measured by a ballistic galvanometer, or as indicated by harmonic generation in the coil. The hysteresis loop can now be constructed in detail as to size and skewness on the basis of a.-c. bridge measurements. This conclusion was reached previously on a compressed iron powder core, and is now confirmed on an annealed laminated 35 per cent nickel-iron core. Observed eddy current losses for this core exceed those calculated from classical theory by 20 per cent. This excess is ascribed to the presence of low permeability surface layers on the sheet magnetic material. The a.-c. residual loss per cycle (nominally independent of frequency, like hysteresis) is not observed by ballistic galvanometer measurements, although it indicates an energy loss some eight times the hysteresis loss for the smallest loop measured (Bm = 1.3 gauss). Analysis of the residual loss shows that it increases with frequency up to about 500 cycles, and remains constant at higher frequencies (to 10,000 cycles per second). Concurrently with the increase of residual loss, the permeability of the alloy is observed to decline with increasing frequency about 1 per cent below the value predicted from eddy current shielding. This effect is most noticeable at frequencies below 1000 cycles."
"Evidence is presented that for a cotton hair structure of the specific type described, calculations are in such close agreement with many experimental data as to suggest the following tentative conclusions: 1. The moisture content necessary to form a monomolecular layer on all internal surface of the cotton hair appears to be slightly more than 1 per cent of the hair weight. 2. Less than half the internal surface, that termed fibril surface, appears to be involved in moisture adsorption which causes appreciable transverse swelling of the cotton hair. Upon this surface multimolecular chains of water seem to condense, the length of such chains increasing progressively up to saturation with corresponding increases in hair diameter throughout the whole of this range, each hydroxyl group in the cellulose surface being the base of a water chain, with separations between these chains along the surface corresponding to the arrangement of the hydroxyl groups on the cellulose surface. 3. Moisture adsorbed on surfaces within the cellulose aggregates composing the fibrils does not appear to be involved in transverse swelling, but may be responsible for the slight longitudinal swelling exhibited by cotton. The capacity of the cotton hair for this type of adsorption suggests that its locus is the ends of crystallites and therefore within the body of the fibrils. To account for the slight swelling, it is assumed that only a monomolecular layer can be adsorbed on these surfaces. 4. A theory is proposed to explain the dependence of the electrical properties of textiles upon their moisture adsorbing properties, and upon the surface distribution of moisture within the submicroscopic structure."
"Determination of Ferromagnetic A nisotropy in Single Crystals and in Polycrystalline Sheets.1 R. M. BOZORTH. Following the work of Akulov and of Heisenberg on the magnetic anisotropy of cubic crystals, it is shown that by taking account of an additional term in the expression for the energy of magnetization the [11OJ direction may under certain conditions be the direction for easiest magnetization in a crystal, instead of [100] or [111] as given by previous theory. This is in accord with experiment. Magnetization curves for single crystals are calculated using the additional term and some peculiarities are recorded. The anisotropy constant appropriate for a single crystal (of iron) has been calculated from measurements on hard-rolled sheet in which there is preferred orientation of the crystals."
"In this paper are discussed several types of crystal band-pass filters which can be used in unbalanced circuits. These types of filters are all resistance compensated, i.e., the resistances associated with the filter elements are in such a position in the filter that they can be effectively brought to the ends of the filter and combined with the terminal resistances with the result that the dissipation produces an additive loss for the filter characteristic and does not affect the sharpness of cut-off attainable. It is shown that all these types of networks can be reduced to three lattice types of crystal filters, and the formulae for these three networks are given. A comparison is given between the characteristics obtainable with resistance compensated crystal and electrical filters and a conclusion regarding their comparison given by V. D. Landon4 is shown to be incomplete."
"A harmonic generator circuit is described which produces a number of harmonics simultaneously at substantially uniform amplitudes by means of a non-linear coil. Generators of this type have been used for the supply of carrier currents to multi-channel carrier telephone systems, for the synchronization carrier frequencies in radio transmitters, and for frequency comparison and standardization. A simple physical picture of the action of the circuit has been derived from an approximate mathematical analysis. The principal roles of the non-linear coil may be regarded as fixing the amount of charge, and timing the charge and discharge of a condenser in series with the resistance load. By suitably proportioning the capacity, the load resistance, and the saturation inductance of the non-linear coil, the amplitudes of the harmonics may be made to approximate uniformity over a wide frequency range. The sharply peaked current pulse developed by condenser discharge passes through the non-linear coil in its saturated state and so contributes nothing to the eddy current loss in the core. In this way the efficiency of frequency transformation is maintained at a comparatively high value for the harmonics in a wide frequency band, even with small core structures. The theory has also been adequate in establishing a basis for design, and in evaluating the effects of extraneous input components."
"Since the first transatlantic radio telephone circuit was opened for service over ten years ago, an increasing number of voice-operated switching devices has been added to the international telephone network. All of these have the common purpose of preventing echo and singing effects due to arranging the facilities to give the best possible transmission, even under difficult radio conditions. Differences in the design and performance of the several types of devices suggest that the advantages and disadvantages of each be made available. The characteristics of two types of “vodas” used on circuits connecting with the United States are described in this paper. For reference purposes, a complete list of Bell System papers relating to these devices is included."
"In listening to speech transmitted over radio circuits, the noise arriving in the intervals between the signals may be annoying. There is also evidence that the intelligibility is reduced due to this noise shifting the sensitivity of the ear. Reducing the noise occurring in the intervals of no speech should therefore improve reception. This paper gives the underlying requirements for a device to accomplish this type of noise reduction and describes the action of a typical “ noise reducer.” Laboratory and field tests are described which show that its use is equivalent to an improvement in signal-to-noise ratio which reaches a maximum value of about 5 db. It also reduces false operation of the voice-operated relays used on long radio telephone connections."
"IN utilizing the broad frequency ranges which the newer carrier systems can transmit the telephone engineer has a problem of choice in band width per channel to be allotted to speech currents. A sufficient width is vital to faithful speech reproduction; and desire for better telephone service always recommends an increase in band width over past practice. A reasonable balance. however, must obtain between various economic factors; and there must always be considered the retation between a proposed system and the other parts of the telephone plant, and also the trend of the art."
"This paper gives a qualitative account of the way in which dielectric constant and absorption data have been interpreted in terms of the physical and chemical structure of materials. The dielectric behavior of materials is determined by the nature of the polarizations which an impressed field induces in them. The various types of polarization which have been demonstrated to exist are listed, together with an outline of their characteristics."
"In this paper the fundamental formulas of variable frequency electric circuit theory are first developed. These are then applied to a study of the transmission, reception and detection of frequency modulated waves. A comparison with amplitude modulation is made and quantitative formulas are developed for comparing the noise-to-signal power ratio in the two modes of modulation."
"The effects of inhomogeneities along the length of a wire transmission circuit are considered, affecting its use as a broad-band transmission medium. These inhomogeneities give rise to reflections of the transmitted energy which in turn cause irregularities in the measured sending or receiving end impedance of the circuit in its overall attenuation, and in its envelope delay. The irregularities comprise departures of the characteristic from the average, in an ensemble of lines, or departures from a smooth curve of the characteristic of a single line when this is plotted as a function of frequency. These irregularities are investigated quantitatively."
"Ten years have elapsed since the opening to public use on January 7, 1927, of the first long distance radio telephone circuit. This form of intercontinental communication has now come into practical business and social use. A network of radio circuits interconnects nearly all the land wire telephone systems of the world. The art has passed through the pioneering stage and is well into a period of growth. The technical side of this development, which the present paper reviews, divides naturally into four categories. The first covers those factors which made possible the beginning of commercial radio telephony.' In the second are the things without which its rapid growth and wide expansion could not have occurred. In the third, are a few incidental but interesting or valuable technical features. The fourth considers future improvements now in view."
"The author describes three negative-grid triodes of unusual design which operate both as oscillators and as amplifiers at ultra-high frequencies. The power output of the smallest tube as an oscillator at 1500 megacycles is 2 watts, and is still capable of an output of 1 watt at 1700 megacycles with an oscillation limit of 1870 megacycles corresponding to a wave-length of 16 centimeters. This tube also offers possibilities as an amplifier at frequencies as high as 1000 megacycles. Such capabilities of the negative-grid triode are notable since this device has appeared to lag behind the magnetron as an oscillator at fre-quencies of above roughly 500 megacycles, while the only successful power amplifiers which have been described for frequencies of the order of 300 megacycles are multi-element tubes."
"In the paper of the above title in the January 1937 issue of the Bell System Technical Journal, an approximation which was not explicitly pointed out was made in deriving equation (17). A note from Mr. K. A. Norton∗ of the Federal Communications Commission points out that equation (17) does not give a reasonable result when τ = 1. The explanation is that two terms which are unimportant except near the transmitter when the ground is a perfect dielectric were deleted."
"What Electrons Can Tell Us about Metals.1 C. J. DAVISSON. Some general statements are made about electron waves and electron diffraction, three typical investigations in which electron diffraction has been employed are described, and the technique of a new type of electron crystal analysis is discussed."
"About two years ago a new wide-band system for multi-ehannel telephone transmission over coaxial cables was described1 An experimental system has now been installed between New York and Philadelphia. The various tests and trials which are planned for this system have not been carried far enough to justify a formal technical paper. Meanwhile, the considerable interest that has been aroused in the system has led to this brief statement of its principal features and its general technical performance as so far measured."
"A consideration of the special problems encountered at ultra-high frequencies has led to the design of a push-pull power pentode, useful as an amplifier, frequency multiplier, and modulator at frequencies of 300 megacycles per second and below. Unusual construction features include the mounting of two pentodes in the same envelope with interconnected screen and suppressor grids, complete shielding between the input and output circuits with no common leads, and provision for cooling all grids while maintaining extremely small inter-electrode spacings. The electrical characteristics depart from the conventional mainly in the low value of lead inductances and the high value of the grid input resistance at ultra-high frequencies. The second part of the paper describes a single stage amplifier unit built for testing the tube at frequencies between eighty and 300 megacycles, and the associated apparatus for measuring input impedance, gain, and harmonic distortion. The results given indicate that by using this new tube it is possible to construct stable amplifiers at ultra-high frequencies up to 300 megacycles, having gains of twelve to twenty-five decibels per stage and delivering several watts of useful power. Stability and distortion compare favorably with those obtained from conventional tubes at much lower frequencies."
"The first part of the paper shows that a vertical dipole does not generate a surface wave which at great distances behaves like Zenneck's plane surface wave. In Parts Two and Three it is shown that it is not necessary to call upon the Zenneck wave to explain the success of the wave antennas."
"Curves are presented to facilitate the calculation of radio propagation over plane earth. The magnitude and phase of the reflection coefficient for all conductivities of interest and for four values of the dielectric constant are presented in the form of curves from which the significant quantities may be read with the same degree of accuracy for all conditions. Simple equations, from which the effect of raising the antennas above the earth's surface may be readily calculated, are presented."
"Early installations of three-phase, four-wire power distribution systems of the multi-grounded or common-neutral type in some cases created noise problems involving neighboring telephone circuits. Operating experience, studies of specific situations and comprehensive cooperative research over a period of years have developed means of largely avoiding difficulties of this character. The relative importance of various features of the power and telephone systems which have been found to affect the noise induction problems involved is discussed and the general cooperative procedures, most helpful in conversions to or extensions of these types of power distribution systems, are outlined."
"In This Paper Three Series Expansions Are Derived For The Wave Function of A Vertical Dipole Placed At The Surface of A Plane Earth. Two Convergent Series And One Asymptotic Series Are Obtained. A Remainder Term For The Latter Series Is Given Which Enables One To Set An Upper Limit To The Amount of Error Obtained By Stopping At Any Particular Stage In The Series."
"The problem of current and potential propagation for long conductors having large leakance to ground arises in connection with certain railway electrification problems, such as inductive effects in exposed communication lines, and voltages to ground of the tracks and of nearby underground cables. Impressed voltages in exposed lines are due partly to induction and partly to earth potential differences, and the latter in particular depend to a considerable extent on the mode of propagation of the track current. Voltages to ground of underground telephone cables depend on the mode of propagation along the cables of current produced in these by nearby railway electrification. These voltages may under certain conditions raise questions as to the possibility of hazard or, in case of direct current, give rise to electrolytic effects."

"The use of make-up is traced briefly from its earliest application in the theaters of ancient Greece to the present time, and the relation between make-up and the various forms of lighting from one period to another is alluded to. — The paper continues with a detailed discussion of the relation between the characteristics of the present make-up components and the color-sensitivities of various types of film. Data are given for the various make-up materials in units of color according to the Lovibond tintometer glasses; photographic reflecting powers are given; and curves are presented showing the spectral transmittance curves of the Lovibond glasses to match various make-up materials."
"The record word-spotting mechanism described here places the pick-up needle upon a predetermined spot on a phonograph record by pressing a remotely located release button after three reference readings, previously established by the trial and error method, have been properly set. The pick-up arm is held poised above the record by a direct electromagnetic pull upon the back end of the pick-up arm. When the electromagnet is de-energized, the pick-up falls due to the pull of gravity. The speed of fall may be controlled by means of an adjustable exhaust port on an air dashpot. No catches or latches are used in releasing the arm. A manually operated open-circuiting release button is in parallel with a second open-circuiting switch in the electromagnet circuit, the second switch being opened each revolution of the turntable by a cam. To release the pick-up, the manually operated button is depressed, but the pick-up is not released until the second switch is cammed open by the turntable. In this way the device is indexed with relation to the radial position of the record so that not only may the correct groove be repeatedly selected, but the desired portion of the groove may be consistently repeated. The effect of eccentricity of the center hole of the record with relation to the recorded grooves is also eliminated. Variations in the size of the record hole are accommodated by means of a tapered centering pin. Each of the mechanical parts, with the exception of the cammed turntable switch, is rigidly located on the single pick-up arm unit. All necessary electrical parts for complete operation of the mechanism on 105- to 125-volt, 50- to 60-cycle alternating current are located on the under side of the motor board."
"Sensitometric testing of photographic materials requires that the laboratory be able to obtain the same results, with a high degree of precision, for identical samples of material, although the individual tests may necessarily be made at widely different times. All factors tending to influence the results must be held constant over long periods of time. — A developing machine is described designed for a laboratory in which a relatively large volume of sensitometric work must be done. It accommodates sixty strips positioned vertically on six metal racks, which can be lowered into the developer simultaneously and removed either simultaneously or individually, so that different development times may be given to different parts of the load. — The developer circulation across the face of the exposed material is sufficiently rapid that further increase of agitation produces little if any increase in the rate of conversion of latent image into metallic silver. The circulation is of two sorts: (1) a relatively slow, uniform movement of developer in the vertical direction produced by a propeller that forces the developer down into a well external to the main tank, from the lower end of which it spreads out beneath a perforated false bottom in the tank and rises throughout the body of the tank, flowing back again into the top of the well; (2)a much more violent agitation produced by vertical paddles moving back and forth close to the exposed surfaces. Both agitating elements are driven by a synchronous motor, assuring the same rate of circulation at all times. The entire machine is jacketed by thermostatically controlled water at 65° ± 0.1°F. — Results show that the circulation throughout the body of the tank is so nearly uniform that they are not influenced by (a) whether the heavily exposed end of the sensitometric strip is up or down, (b) the position of the strip within the tank, or (c) whether a complete or partial load of strips is developed at one time. Results indicate also that the agitation is sufficiently violent that the rate of conversion of latent image into metallic silver is at or near the maximum attainable. Uniformity and reproducibility of development is very markedly superior to that attainable with any type of hand- or machine-rocked tray with which the authors have had experience, and the use of the machine marks a very definite advance in the precision with which sensitometric values may be established."
"A recording physical densitometer designed to read strips from the type IIb sensitometer has been previously described.1 This instrument has been in service in the sensitometric department of the Kodak Research Laboratories for about one year, during which time it has been operated steadily. Approximately 100,000 sensitometric strips have been read thus far. The instrument is capable of an output of about 700 strips per day. — Experience has shown that more repeatable results are attained with this instrument than by routine, visual methods. Comparative data accumulated in an experiment lasting several weeks are presented, together with a time study of the two methods of densitometry. Certain features to be changed in the design of a new instrument will be discussed. The new instrument will be improved in both ruggedness and speed. — The advisability of using devices of this nature in a release print laboratory will depend upon a number of factors, such as initial cost, quantity and quality of output, and ease of maintenance."
"In the projection of lenticular color-films a large portion of the incident light is lost by absorption in the tricolor filters. To determine the feasibility of satisfactorily showing these films in large theaters, an experimental projector was set up embodying the few simple changes in standard theater equipment that were necessary to obtain the required large increase in screen illumination. — Successful demonstrations with the apparatus at Loew's Rochester Theater at Rochester and the Center Theater at New York have proved that it is quite possible to secure enough screen brightness to give a satisfactory showing of the lenticular films in the majority of theaters. — The principal changes made in the standard projection apparatus in order to obtain the greatly increased illumination were as follows: (1) Increased Relative Aperture.—By substituting an f/1.6 projection lens for the f/2.4 lens commonly used, and by increasing the working relative aperture of the 65-ampere high-intensity reflector arc so as to take full advantage of the increased aperture of the projection lens, it was possible to get 2.25 times the screen illumination obtained with the regular equipment. (2) Reduction of Shutter Loss.—A further increase was obtained by the use of a quicker pull-down and a corresponding reduction in the angle of the shutter blades; this may not, however, be feasible in practice. (3) Increased Filter Transmission.—As a result of numerous practical tests it was found to be possible to increase the transmission of the tricolor projection filters by 33 per cent, without undue loss of color values. (4) Lower Print Density.—The excellent tone reproduction obtained in the process, together with a modification of the optics of the lenticular film, makes possible a substantial lowering of the print density. The resultant increase in the brightness of the projected image amounts to some 25 per cent. — The large increase in the radiant energy directed upon the film has made it necessary to employ a heat filter in the condenser system. — Refinements in the present system are expected to produce additional small increases in illumination, and it is believed to be possible to develop other special equipment to take adequate care of the few (special) cases where it is necessary to project upon an unusually large screen."
"Process photography, which is the broad classification given to all branches of special and trick cinematography, plays an important part in making today's motion picture. Many articles have appeared relating to this subject, but, unfortunately, most of them have been devoted only to a discussion of the importance of this branch of photography, and very few writers have divulged any of the details of the methods employed. This paper sets forth in general the underlying procedure in the various branches of the art, and treats many phases thereof in sufficient detail to be fully informative. — The branches of process photography disclosed include: transitional effects, such as dissolves and wipes; matte shots; simple and intricate multiple exposures; composites and montages; animated titles and presentation effects; combined drawing and actual photography; optical trick printers and cameras; miniature projection background process; problems in making dupe negatives by projection, dodging, etc. Important steps are described and illustrated, and special devices are shown and their essential functions and operation described."
"A brief review of some of the current improvements in production methods and production tools used in the motion picture industry. — The subjects mentioned include processing laboratories, cameras, synchronizing methods, and various items of sound equipment and methods, including a review of the present status of push-pull recording."
"An investigation of two spherical and aspheric condensers, with an f/1.65 projection lens and a test series of high-intensity biplane filament lamps ranging from 200 to 2000 watts, has been conducted to determine the levels of illumination attainable in 16-mm. projection by varying the light-source size."
"Improvements made during the past year in methods, apparatus, and materials used in making medical motion pictures, particularly Kodachrome, and the characteristics of an emulsion suitable for exposure with artificial light are discussed. The uses of special accessories for medical motion picture photography are described."
"Hypersensitization by mercury vapor increases the speed of photographic negative emulsions about 50 to 150 per cent, depending upon the emulsions used for the treatment. The important features of this method that make it superior to the well known wet-hypersensitizing methods are: (1) The film does not have to be put through a bathing process and then dried. (2) The mercury vapors are active also upon tightly wound spools of film, the sensitizing effect being uniformly spread over the whole length (e. g., of a 1000-foot roll of 35-mm. motion picture film). If sufficient time is available for hypersensitizing, the films need not even be removed from their original wrappers, as the mercury vapors diffuse sufficiently through the wrapping material. (3) The increase of sensitivity is general throughout the range of wavelength of light to which the film was originally sensitive. (4) Not only can unexposed film be hypersensitized by this method, but it is also possible to intensify the latent image with mercury vapors.(5) The stability of the film is not permanently affected, although the increase in speed is gradually lost over a period of four weeks of aging. The clearness, however, remains the same, and may even improve somewhat. By a second treatment with mercury vapor the hypersensitization can be renewed in a film that has recovered from previous hypersensitizing."
"An unmodulated sound-track shows 96-cycle modulation on development. The effect is a maximum at the edge of the sprocket holes and diminishes exponentially for a distance of approximately 30 mils into the sound-track. A film modulated by a constant frequency shows 96-cycle amplitude and frequency modulation over the same area. Both effects are introduced principally during processing of the film. A film having no sprocket holes on the sound-track side is entirely free of these effects. The conclusion is that processing standards in many laboratories require improvement to eliminate distortions of this type."
"Although many of the basic ideas involved in the operation of present-day loud speakers were conceived during the early stages of the development of the telephone, it was not until the advent of the vacuum tube amplifier that these principles were applied to the design of structures capable of delivering sufficient acoustical power to be audible throughout a room or auditorium. Having reached this stage, however, the developments that culminated in the sound reproducing systems employed with present-day sound pictures came in rapid succession. These developments have embraced all phases of loud speaker design, with the result that systems are now available that convert from 25 to 50 per cent of the electrical input into acoustical output, and maintain conversion efficiencies of this order of magnitude over a frequency range of 50 to 10,000 cps. These systems are so designed as to be capable of reproducing the recorded sound at intensities that not only greatly enhance the dramatic effect of the presentation in the theater, but also open entirely new fields in recording. All these improvements have been attained with a reduction in distortion and improved fidelity of the reproduced sound. The directional properties of the loud speakers also have been markedly improved, with the result that the better quality of reproduction achieved is available throughout the entire seating area and the undesirable beam effects previously experienced have been eliminated."
"In July, 1936, the project of adopting a standard synchronizing system for cameras was suggested to the Research Council of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences for the purpose of eliminating confusion on stages resulting from the use of clap-sticks and other visual-auditory synchronizing devices, to derive from the system the advantages of adopting uniform methods in all studios, and to achieve such uniformity among cameras as will allow using the cameras in all studios without altering the synchronizing equipment. Specifications of the standard synchronizing system are given for cameras of several makes."
"A description of studies made at the Institut für Schwingungforschung, Berlin, in the transmission of sound and vibration in buildings, with particular reference to the analogies between the properties of sound insulating structures and electrical networks. Some of the problems treated deal with the air-borne transmission of sound through multiple walls; the propagation of sound in building materials, and the physical properties of insulating materials for structure-borne sound; and electrical apparatus for measuring vibrations in buildings."
"Encouraged by a grant from the American Council on Education, the United States Office of Education launched the National Visual Instruction Survey in January, 1936, to determine (1) the nature of the visual and auditory equipment owned by elementary and secondary schools in the United States, (2) the extent of its use, and (3) ways in which national agencies can facilitate the use of visual and auditory aids for instructional purposes. The author of this article directed the survey, and Mr. Allen W. Noble assisted him. Reports were received from approximately 9000 school systems covering 95 per cent of all cities with a population of 5000 or more, and a fair percentage of the rural school districts. The paper summarizes the results of the survey."
"Until last year no organization existed for preserving films of outstanding merit or for arranging for their distribution and study by those interested in film as living art and in its history and development. A grant from the Rockefeller Foundation and private gifts permitted the Museum of Modern Art to establish such a Film Library in June, 1935, under the presidency of John Hay Whitney, with Will H. Hays, Chairman of the Advisory Committee. — The functions of the Film Library are to trace, obtain, and preserve important films, American and foreign; to edit and assemble such films into programs for educational and non-commercial exhibition; to arrange notes and critical appraisals of them; to assemble a library of books and data on the films; and otherwise to make available information concerning their artistic, dramatic, and historical aspects to all who may be seriously interested. The series for 1936 consists of (1) The Development of Narrative (1895–1911); (2) The Rise of the American Film (1912–17); (3) D. W. Griffith (Intolerance); (4) The German Influence; (5) The Talkies."
"After a brief discussion of the matter of suitable instruments and tools for the projectionist, for adjusting and maintaining his equipment, a neon-tube oscilloscope for investigating defects in the sound reproduction is described. By means of this instrument the presence of noises and other defects in reproduction due to maladjustment of the equipment can be detected, and the means of eliminating these distortions indicated. — The general construction of the instrument and some of its applications are described."
"During the Conventions of the Society, symposiums on new motion picture apparatus are held, in which various manufacturers of equipment describe and demonstrate their new products and developments. Some of this equipment is described in the following pages; the remainder will be published in subsequent issues of the Journal."
"As one of the events of the Spring, 1937, Convention of the Society held at Hollywood, Calif., a symposium on the subject of “How Motion Pictures Are Made” was arranged by members of the staff of Universal Studios, Mr. H. G. Tasker* acting as Chairman. The audience of members and guests of the Society, numbering in excess of 600 persons, assembled at 8 P.M. on stage 10 of the Studio, which is normally devoted to scoring and prescoring."
"There is an old saying among us in the motion picture industry that every picture is grief and that is the way it starts."
"As most of you know, we do not record songs or orchestras on the set during the filming of a picture. Instead, we record them in advance, usually before the picture goes into production. This we call prescoring. We prescore for several reasons, which I shall explain as I outline the method of prescoring."
"It is my purpose this evening to paint a word picture of New Universal's art department; to show you how it works and functions; to give you, somehow, the feeling that pulsates through the members of its entire staff."
"The Sub-Committee has investigated the possibility of adopting the SMPE standard perforation for negative film, and has come to the conclusion that various factors, especially the stock of background films, makes it impossible to use the SMPE standard perforation universally. — The Committee now proposes that the rectangular perforation proposed by Howell and Dubray in 1932 be adopted as the standard perforation for both negative and positive. This perforation would operate satisfactorily on all apparatus designed for the Bell & Howell perforation, and should give little or no trouble on apparatus designed for the SMPE standard perforation."
"A description of a new type of dynamic light-valve with oil-damped mirror used in the “Eurocord” recording equipment. Damping by oil, though influenced by temperature, is compensated automatically."
"Color photography applied to publicity stills represents a very valuable asset for the motion picture industry. The demand for high-quality results and speeds places color stills in a special class of their own, and therefore the discussion of the various methods of obtaining color-separation negatives is carried out essentially upon the basis of these requirements. For the production of sample prints on paper, many of the available methods are discussed, such as carbon, carbro, dye transfer, chemical toning, etc., emphasis being placed upon the methods that are capable of giving results most suitable to the needs of motion picture industry. The general discussion and the extensive bibliography should be found valuable by those who wish to study the subject of color photography in greater detail."
"Compulations and measurements show that the background noise of film can be interpreted as the superposition of two types of noise: surface noise, and grain noise. The surface noise power decreases with the square of specular transmission; the grain noise power reaches a maximum at 50 per dent transmission. Accordingly, it is found that under conditions of variable-width recording surface noise is predominant; for variable-density recording, grain noise is the main factor. The average area of the grains or grain clusters can be calculated from the signal-to-noise ratio; their average volume from the total weight of silver per square centimeter at a given density; their average thickness from the quotient of volume and area. For equal grain sizes, surface exposure such as obtained by ultraviolet illumination is definitely noisier than penetrating exposure. — Upon the basis of random three-dimensional distribution of sensitized grains and of the quantum theoretical findings of previous investigators, the shapes of H&D curves were calculated. The assumption that a halide grain is sensitized by a single photon leads to a toe shape that is more rounded than is found in practice. The actual shape of the characteristic from toe to shoulder is accounted for by the assumption that it takes two photons to sensitize a silver halide grain. It is expressed by the equation: — $$D={D_{\\infty}\\over {\\rm ln}_{\\varphi}}\\left[\\epsilon^{-e\\tau}-\\epsilon^{-e}-\\int^{e}_{e\\tau}{1- \\epsilon^{-x}\\over x}dx \\right]$$ — in which τ represents the translucence of the unexposed emulsion to the aclinic light. — The experimental fact that the straight portions of H&D curves obtained from the same emulsion at various gammas originate from a single point which is depressed by bromide content is explainable by taking into account the fact that the emulsion contains silver halide grains of more than one size and speed."
"During the Conventions of the Society, symposiums on new motion picture apparatus are held, in which various manufacturers of equipment describe and demonstrate their new products and developments. Some of this equipment is described in the following pages; the remainder will be published in subsequent issues of the Journal."
"The editors present for convenient reference a list of articles dealing with subjects cognate to motion picture engineering published in a number of selected journals. Photostatic copies may be obtained from the Library of Congress, Washington, D. C, or from the New York Public Library, New York, N. Y. Micro copies of articles in those magazines that are available may be obtained from the Library of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C."
"The importance of constant record speed in machines used for reproduction of music was realized by Thomas A. Edison and many other pioneers in sound recording. Crude performance from other standpoints made it hardly worth while for the earlier workers to attempt to obtain extremely high standards of speed constancy. — The flyball type of phonograph governor came into the picture and has been worked so well that it has not even yet been superseded, although with synchronous motor drives for certain types of equipment the governor is no longer necessary. — Recording sound photographically probably began with the work of Alexander Graham Bell who made records on glass disks; but not until long celluloid films were available and the motion picture thoroughly established did photographic sound recording become a competitor with the disk. As late as 1930, there were many engineers who advocated the disk for sound-picture work. While the same general principle applies to both mechanical and photographic records, the latter involves certain additional problems. — Among the earlier workers in this field, the expedients adopted by C. A. Hoxie and C. L. Heisler, of General Electric Company, deserve recognition. The paper gives brief descriptions and discussions of a number of ingenious arrangements for improving speed constancy that have been employed by various inventors and engineers. Some of these expedients have been applied to record turntables and some to film equipment."
"Lenses are used to form images for two principal purposes first, to produce the most accurate record possible of the original object; and second, to produce a pleasing effect. The character of the image formed by a lens depends upon diffraction and upon the residual aberrations remaining after the designer and the manufacturer have done their best. For pictures of the first type it is desirable that aberrations be reduced to a minimum, but for pictures of the second type they are very often deliberately employed to produce desired effects. In motion picture projection, lenses of the first class are doubtless always desired. In motion picture photography, some attention has been given to achieving special effects by deliberately introducing aberrations into the lens. — Among the many aberrations that afflict lenses, one of the most important is chromatic. Since, in general, only two colors can be brought to a common focus, some thought has been given to the question of what two colors it is best to choose to meet the requirements of various kinds of lighting and different types of sensitivity of the emulsion. Recent experiments indicate that for a combination of particular interest in motion picture photography, namely, incandescent lighting and super-pan emulsion, no significant difference in performance is detectable among lenses of 12-inch focus or less, depending upon whether the two colors chosen for chromatism are yellow and violet, or red and violet."
"A brief résumé of the various methods used to describe, analyze, or specify colors, including color names, systems of material color standards, colorimeters, and spectrophotometric methods. The computation of colorimetric quantities from spectrophotometric data is considered, together with methods of specification based thereon."
"Recently materials for direct disk recording and reproducing work have been improved so that they are now suitable for many uses. These materials, as they are available on the market, are classified chemically into five groups, and measurements are given of frequency characteristic, surface noise, life, distortion, etc., and data have been taken with both lateral and vertical recording."
"During the Conventions of the Society, symposiums on new motion picture apparatus are held, in which various manufacturers of equipment describe and demonstrate their new products and developments. Some of this equipment is described in the following pages; the remainder will be published in subsequent issues of the Journal."
"In additive processes the primaries are generally blue-violet, green, orange spectral bands, which are not narrow and overlap to some extent. The exposure latitude of a color-screen process is less then that of black-and-white negative stock. Underexposures often tend toward excessive blue, and overexposures toward some other predominant color, due in some measure to differences in the foot and shoulder of the characteristic curves of the emulsion when exposed to the three primary bands. — Overexposure results in dilution of the colors, due to invasion of each primary into its neighbor's territory. There is thus a color-saturation latitude in the screen or matrix, distinct from a true emulsion latitude. The object here is to discuss a method of calculating the approximate range of studio light-intensity that will preserve the best color balance of which any particular additive process may be capable. — For Dufaycolor film, a wedge spectrogram of suitable sleepness is made representing average exposure, such as from a density of 0 to 2.5. Upon development and reversal, the peaks throughout the wedge spectrum are shown as completely saturated (i.e., 100 per cent of the reseau or matrix saturation). But as any spectral zone is followed downward from the peak, the color becomes diluted and may become even white as the image approaches the base line, and, therefore, maximum expousre. — This is caused by the fact that, upon overexpousre, scattering carries the light behind (say) a green element into the region of neighboring blue and red elements, so that the resulting color is reseau-green plus some blue and red, or reseau-green plus white. The effect is accentuated in reseau composed of less saturated color elements. By measuring from the peak to the position on any ordinate where distinct dilution becomes apparent, the permissible range of light-intensity on the set can be computed from the difference of the log opacities of the two points on the ordinate."
"The effect of uneven slit illumination upon the reproduction of variable-width sound-tracks of the unilateral and bilateral types are analyzed. The ground-noise reduction for unilateral tracks is considered, as accomplished by a single-vane shutter so that the modulations are recorded symmetrically with respect to the center of the track. For bilateral tracks both electrical biasing and double-vane shutters are considered for effecting ground-noise reduction. — When the slit illumination increases linearly across the sound-track, bilateral records either with electrical or shutter ground-noise reduction are not distorted. When the illumination changes by 20 per cent across the sound-track by any uniform function that would correspond to any actual case of faulty adjustment, the harmonic distortion in no case exceeds 3 per cent for fully modulated signals. Further, the percentage of distortion decreases with the signal strength. Thus, while the reproduction of variable-width recordings is subject to distortion by uneven slit illumination, it is not excessive on equipment properly serviced."
"The details of the organization of the Research Council of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences are outlined, and brief sketches are presented of the work of several of the more important Committees working under the auspices of the Council, including the Committee on Improvement of Release Print Quality, the Silent Camera Committee, Committee on Screen Illumination, Committee on Industrial Education, the Scientific Committee, and the Sound Recording Committee."
"A new design of volume indicator for use in sound recording is described, embracing the features of peak amplitude response and a linear decibel scale. The peak response characteristic results in a better indication of peak amplitudes, and thereby affords protection of the modulator against overloads. The linear decibel scale extends the useful range of the indicator about 12 db., thereby indicating low levels formerly imperceptible."
"In the reproduction of a hill-and-dale recording, the curve traced by the reproducer stylus differs from the recorded curve, with the consequent introduction of both frequency and amplitude distortion. This distortion is here called “tracing distortion,” and must be tolerated only in virtue of the physical necessity of a finite tip radius for the reproducer stylus. A description is given of the results obtained in a study of this phenomenon, together with curves and formulas for the quantitative determination of the magnitude of both the amplitude distortion (i. e., harmonic generation) and the frequency distortion (i. e., decay in fundamental), as functions of the amplitude and frequency of the recorded undulation, the linear groove speed, and the tip radius of the reproducer stylus. — Among other conclusions reached, it is shown that the maintenance of the minimum radius of curvature of the recorded undulations at least equal to or larger than the tip radius of the reproducer stylus is an extremely inaccurate criterion of good-quality reproduction. For “constant-velocity” recordings, less than 10 per cent rms. harmonic generation is obtained when the minimum radius of curvature of the recorded undulation is greater than 5 times the tip radius of the reproducer stylus. Moreover, the generation of harmonics due to tracing distortion is a much more serious limitation upon the quality of the reproduction than is the loss or attenuation of fundamental frequency, as, for example, in cases where the loss of fundamental is only 2 db., the harmonic generation is prohibitively high, being much greater than 10 per cent. — The Introduction and Section I give a physical account of the phenomenon of tracing distortion and deal with all the data necessary for a practical application of the formulas derived in Section II."
"A graininess meter as an instrument for objective and quantitative determination of density fluctuations of photographic emulsions is described. The instrument, specially designed for the purpose, produces a microphotometric record of a uniformly exposed area in terms of relative transparency fluctuations (ΔT/Tm) (Tm — mean transparency). The resolving power of the optical system is greater than the individual grain size, so that granularity as well as graininess is recorded. Unlike the usual microphotometric records, the records are produced in such a way that they can directly undergo a process of partial integration in a photoelectric integrator designed for the purpose. Thus the distribution of the areas occupied by transparency fluctuations as a function of the magnitude of the deviation is determined. In addition, the sum of the fluctuations can also be measured. The distribution function is found to be predominantly a Gaussian probability function (C/G)e-(x/G)2, upon which an exponential distribution function (C/G)e-(x/G) is superimposed. The graininess constant G is defined as the inverse rate of decline of the occurrence of relative transparency fluctuations with the deviation from average transparency. A construction of the integrator, though provisory, is given which allows direct readings of the numerical values of G without involving calculations. — The graininess meter has been applied to the measurements of the graininess-density function and, furthermore, to the effect upon the emulsion by the variation of the mode of development. In addition, quantitative determinations of the increase of the graininess in contact prints with respect to the graininess qualities of the negative materials from which the print is made are described."

"This report of the Progress Committee covers the year 1936. The advances in the cinematographic art during that period are classified under the headings: (I) Cinematography, (II) Sound Recording, (III) Sound and Picture Reproduction, (IV) Publications and New Books; (Appendix A) General field of progress of the motion picture industry in Great Britain, (Appendix B) Motion picture developments in Austria, (Appendix C) Report of the activities in the cinematographic field in Germany during 1936."
"A description of the toning of the entire release of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer production “The Good Earth,” using a modified developing machine."
"The design of a transmission-measuring system utilizing an Esterline Angus recording meter is described. A circuit was developed requiring a special triode exhibiting a logarithmic relation between change of grid bias and plate current. The audio oscillator is a commercial type to which has been added a synchronous motor drive geared to the frequency dial. For the amplifier-rectifier, required to operate the 5-ma. recording meter, use is made of a push-pull class A amplifier terminated by a full-wave, approximately square-law tube rectifier, the d-c. output of the latter being connected to the recording meter. — The paper concludes with a discussion of the various applications to which the system may be put."
"The studios occupy 28 acres of a 165-acre estate in Buckinghamshire about 17 miles from the center of London. Fine gardens stretching to the edge of dense woodland provide a natural setting that can be adapted easily for exterior photography. There are seven stages, totalling 120,000 square-feet of floor area. Two stages are 250 by 120 by 45 feet (high); two are 125 by 120 by 45; and three are 120 by 80 by 35. Details of the foundation and wall construction are given. The main reviewing theater is designed for reviews and for scoring; for the latter the reverberation period can be adjusted to 0.8 second and for the former, 1.5 seconds. — A description is included of the various shops that service the studios, not only for set construction but also for equipment. The metal shop, for example, has turned out more than 700 lamps for set lighting, two optical printers, a projection printer, a stop-motion machine, and a rear projector. — In the sound stages, only the dubbing channel is of the permanent type. A brief description is given of the portable sound channels, the camera department, and the processing laboratories. Two automatic developing machines, capable of developing 480 and 1000 feet per hour, are available for film processing. Automatic mixing equipment is used for preparation of solutions. — The electrical power plant is described and details are included on fire protection, water supply, and sewage disposal."
"Among the projects under consideration by the Committee during the past six months are those of screen brightness; its desirable values and methods of measuring it; the question of using a visual test-pattern for checking screen illumination; revisions of the projection room plans; questions of projector motors and take-ups, and difficulties incident to the starting of projector motors; requirements of sound screens; and a recently initiated survey of theaters throughout the United States to determine not only existing conditions of projection, but also for the purpose of establishing a set of recommendations regarding theater structures."
"With the recent reorganization of the Committee representation was effected from all the important exchange companies, in addition to the theater and laboratory branches of the industry, which gives the Committee close contact with all the important factors in which it may at any time be interested. — The attention of the Committee is restricted to the physical handling of film in exchanges, questions of safety and fire prevention, technic and supervision of inspection, uniformity of exchange practice, and the like. — Projects have been initiated for drawing up plans for an ideal exchange, for preparing an instructional booklet for exchanges, and for producing a descriptive film to supplement the booklet."
"The Eastman perforation, although adopted by the Society as a standard for positive and negative film, has certain disadvantages for use in connection with color processes and for background projection. The reasons for these limitations are analyzed, and a proposal is made that the important advantages of the Eastman filleted rectangular shape be retained in a perforation, the dimensions of which are the same as those of the Bell & Howell perforation. Such a perforation would fit existing Bell & Howell registering pins. — The use of a photocell having most of its sensitivity outside the visible spectral region imposes an added burden to those working upon color sound processes. Search is urged for a cell that would have all the advantages of existing caesium cells but with its chief sensitive response in the visible range. — The term “Direct Color Developer Process” is recommended for a color process wherein non-diffusing color-formers in the emulsion (multiple-layer) combine with the oxidation products of the developer to form insoluble dyes. A process of this type was introduced recently by Agfa."
"A résumé is presented of correspondence conducted with the British Institute of Cinematography. The report of this organization is abstracted as follows: (1) A theoretical analysis of the light losses in a projector using direct illumination is made, showing that for every 100 lumens emitted by the lamp, only 2.43 lumens find their way through the projection lens; (2) it is suggested that unit intensity be used as a method of comparison between one projector and another and that 1 foot-candle be regarded as an average value for home use and 4 foot-candles for small auditoriums. — Objection is taken by this Committee to the latter proposal, and the opinion is expressed that the suggested values are too low. A satisfactory intensity should cover projection of adequate quality. — Attention of the Society is directed to the matter of standardizing the procedure for the determination of total screen lumens."
"The membership of the Society is growing steadily at the net rate of 25 to 30 members a month, the present (April 30, 1937) membership being 1283, with 30 applications pending. The broadening of the membership to include all the important countries of the world, in addition to the domestic membership, is indicative of the widening activities of the Society in international motion picture affairs."

"The historical background of three-dimensional motion pictures is first discussed, leading up to the requirements of true stereoscopy and a discussion of some of the factors involved, such as overlap, detail, apparent sizes of objects, haze, lighting effects, and two-eye pictures taken eye-distance apart. Serious three-dimensional work falls into two classes: (a) critical-angle stereoscopy, and (b) anaglyph stereoscopy. Under the latter heading falls the use of colors to achieve stereoscopic effects, as in Lumière's work, and Audioscopics, which have several disadvantages; also polarizing anaglyphs, first operated by Anderton in 1893, and most recently through the use of Polaroid. — Advantages to be gained from three-dimensional pictures in color as opposed to single pictures using the same color system are explained. Some of the problems of photographers and theaters in using the Polaroid system are described, followed by a discussion of the advantages of stereoscopic pictures in dramatic delineation."
"Among the important projects under consideration by the Committee are (1) a survey of theater characteristics, as regards screen sizes and brightnesses; viewing angles and areas; projection angles and auditorium dimensions; and equipment in use; (2) a study of screen illumination; and (3) investigation of fire hazards. — The major portion of the report deals with a proposed revision of projector aperture dimensions by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, and the Committee's arguments for disapproving the proposals."
"It is desirable that all laboratories dealing with photographic problems shall be in agreement upon the significance of the term “density,” and that the means for numerically determining this value shall be specifiable. — In different optical systems, the apparent “light-stopping power” of a given photographic image will vary because of the manner in which that sample reflects, scatters, and absorbs light. Since the numerical value obtained depends upon the characteristics of the optical system used in the densitometer, it becomes necessary to specify the optical system to be used as a reference standard. Because it may be definitely specified, the integrating sphere is suggested as the light-collector for this standard optical system. Precautions that must be followed in using the sphere are enumerated. — It is shown that once some standard optical system is adopted, several other types of optical systems may be employed in practical instruments if the instruments are calibrated under actual working conditions with photographic images previously measured in the system adopted as standard. — The paper concludes with a discussion of the interrelationships of log10 apparent opacity as determined in several optical systems commonly used in densitometry."
"It is well known that the per cent syllable articulation decreases with increasing distance between the speaker and the microphone or listener. It is shown that when a velocity-ribbon microphone is set so far behind a pressure-operated microphone that the recorded reverberation is the same for both microphones, the per cent syllable articulation remains unchanged. Attention is drawn to the undesirable effects of interference for steady tones, and mention is made of ways to reduce such interference."
"A discussion of interference effects in rooms, and their influence upon syllable articulation and naturalness of reproduction. Results achieved with different types of microphones, placement of the microphone, and acoustic treatment of the room are discussed."
"A résumé, of membership activities since the beginning of the year. The growth of membership is continuing apace, and at the present time stands at its all-time high figure."
"During the Conventions of the Society, symposiums on new motion picture apparatus are held, in which various manufacturers of equipment describe and demonstrate their new products and developments. Some of this equipment is described in the following pages; the remainder will be published in subsequent issues of the Journal."

"A brief review is given of the studies made of the several characteristics of television images and other factors that have been effective in establishing standards, in determining satisfactory performance, and in guiding the step-by-step development of the RCA electronic system of high-definition television. — The system employs the “Iconoscope,” a cathode-ray tube for translating the visual image into electrical impulses, and the “Kinescope” for transforming the electrical impulses back into the variations of light-intensity to reproduce the image. The sensitivity and characteristics of the “Iconoscope” as a pick-up device are discussed. — The fundamentals of the RCA high-definition television system now under experimental field test in the New York area and the standards presently employed are reviewed. Photographs of the studios and other parts of the field-test facilities are included. A brief review is given to indicate the progress made and the results attained up to the present time in these field tests. — The technic of formulating and presenting television programs is peculiar to the requirements of television. The development of the technic is presently related to programs employing artists in studios, outside pick-ups, and motion picture film. The requirements of program technic are discussed."
"This report supplements the report of May 15, 1936, of the Scientific Committee of the Research Council of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences. Developments since the appearance of the first report are traced briefly, specific reference being made to the recent British experiment and other developments abroad, as well as to the field-tests now being conducted in America."
"Revised drawings for most of the standards, except those on sound sprockets, have been prepared and are to appear in a forthcoming issue of the Journal. — There have been no fundamental changes except with regard to the sound-film. For 35-mm. film, the dimensions of the sound-track have been changed; and for 16-mm. sound-film, similar changes have been made and the distance between the picture and the corresponding sound has been changed to 26 frames."
"A brief account of new accessions to the SMPE motion picture exhibit at the Los Angeles Museum, and a description of two new galleries added to the display facilities."
"A brief account of the plan followed by the Committee in constructing and arranging Convention programs."
"The lighting of motion pictures is discussed with relation to a new technic developed by the author and employed in several recent productions, notably “Anthony Adverse” and “The Life of Emile Zola.” — The use of artificial lighting for motion picture scenes originated with attempts to imitate the flat overall illumination produced by daylight on the early “daylight” stages. When the concepts of modelling and effect lighting were introduced, they were regarded merely as adjuncts to an overall flat general lighting. They have, in the main, so continued until today, despite the great advances made in optics and sensitive materials. — The author holds that under modern conditions, this technic is faulty. He has therefore dispensed with the so-called “general lighting,” and has for some time done all his lighting with various types of spotlighting units. This enables him to light more precisely; to accommodate his effects and his equipment to the physical requirements of modern production technic; and to achieve more natural effects upon the screen."
"Within the past several months the technic of lighting Technicolor motion pictures has changed from more or less flat, evenly illuminated sets of highlight level to a method whereby the cinematographer now uses a much lower level of general illumination and has greater freedom with the use of “modelling” lamps. — Recent developments in arc lamps for use in Technicolor lighting are discussed. The changed technic of lighting, made possible by the new equipment and the laboratory advancements, is briefly explained. The uses of each type of illuminant, diffusion screens, black screens, and other lighting-control devices are described. An explanation is given of the part taken by the chief set electrician, or “gaffer,” in lighting motion picture sets."
"The basic principles of motion picture set lighting are outlined, and the technic of “key” lighting, employed by most cinematographers, is discussed. — Several new types of lamps that have found extensive use are described in detail. Technical data regarding them are presented along with information regarding their application in cinematography."
"The principles and characteristics of various types of power-level indicators used in sound recording are described, including the copper oxide, various vacuum-tube devices including the peak-reading meter, and the recording types of meters."
"In the past year and a half light-weight microphones and new pick-up equipment have been made available. The apparatus described in the paper consists of a fish-pole type of microphone boom with accessories, and a complete stage pick-up unit. The boom is readily adaptable to a number of pick-up conditions where light weight, small size, and ease of handling are necessary. — The stage pick-up unit is readily portable and of relatively small weight and size. It includes the pick-up amplifier, booster amplifier, and power supply, with a small amount of storage space. It completely replaces the large type of monitoring booth previously employed. The weight of the unit being about 300 pounds, a great saving in operating cost is effected and greater simplicity of operation achieved."
"The Engineering Department at the Twentieth Century-Fox Film Studios is responsible for the various technical operations of the studio, which can be classified under the headings of Air-Conditioning, Plumbing, Foundry, Mechanical, or Electrical activities. These responsibilities cover a considerable portion of the technical activities of a studio, and a great deal of effort is required to take care of the routine matters that arise each day. However, the interesting work of this department lies in the special engineering problems that arise in the production of motion pictures. The paper describes some of the various engineering problems that have been encountered in the production of motion pictures at this studio."
"During the Conventions of the Society, symposiums on new motion picture apparatus are held, in which various manufacturers of equipment describe and demonstrate their new products and developments. Some of this equipment is described in the following pages; the remainder will be published in subsequent issues of the Journal."
"The editors present for convenient reference a list of articles dealing with subjects cognate to motion picture engineering published in a number of selected journals.

Micro copies of articles in those magazines that are available may be obtained from the Library of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C."
"With the increasing growth of the 16-mm. sound-film industry the question of standardizing the optical reduction ratio naturally arose. With the view of studying this problem, the author was requested by the SMPE Standards Committee to organize the information available and to present it so arranged to the Standards Committee for further study. — The paper undertakes the study of the problem with regard to the requirements of optical reduction and to the areas available upon the film."
"A brief account of some of the more important phases of manufacturing motion picture film, tracing the product through the plant from the raw materials through the Chemical, Roll Coating, Emulsion Coating, and finally the Finished Film Departments."
"The design of compensated microphone mixer circuits is discussed. The purpose of such circuits is to provide impedance matches for all the microphones in the circuits by means of so-called “compensating” or “building-out” resistors. General equations are obtained for the values of these resistors for multi-channel mixers of both the parallel and series-parallel type."
"Soft x-rays have been used in radiographing leather, textiles, paper, biological specimens, etc. The most recent application is in recording soft x-ray motion pictures directly upon the film, using a special emulsion having a high sensitivity to soft x-rays. Radiographs were made at a speed of 16 frames per second. — The camera used was a Universal model C with the lens removed and a piece of infrared gelatin filter covering the gate to protect the film from light, and, at the same time, to furnish a support for the subject. The camera shutter absorbs the soft x-rays from the tube during the short exposures between frames, thus allowing continuous operation of the tube. — A special form of x-ray tube fitted with an extremely thin window is required for the production of radiation suitable for radiographing thin subjects. — Soft x-ray motion pictures of the yellow meal worm show peristaltic waves, gas bells leaving the stomach through the mouth, and the effects of various anesthetic vapors on the internal movements."
"A method of producing panoramic motion pictures, to be projected upon the interior of a cylindrical screen, is described. An unbroken panorama of 360 degrees is formed and the spectator may look in any direction he pleases."
"A photoelectric cell densitometer is described that makes use of a modulated light-source, stable high-vacuum photoelectric cell, and an audio amplifier provided with a logarithmic potentiometer and multiplier supplying the desired linearity of calibration, the instrument being operated entirely by alternating current. Theoretical factors, density standards, and design problems of the instrument are also considered."
"During the Conventions of the Society, symposiums on new motion picture apparatus are held, in which various manufacturers of equipment describe and demonstrate their new products and developments. Some of this equipment is described in the following pages; the remainder will be published in subsequent issues of the Journal."
"The editors present for convenient reference a list of articles dealing with subjects cognate to motion picture engineering published in a number of selected journals. Photostatic copies may be obtained from the Library of Congress, Washington, D. C., or from the New York Public Library, New York, N. Y. Micro copies of articles in those magazines that are available may be obtained from the Library of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C."
"An analysis is made of the advantages and limitations of the lenticular color-film system over that of the screen-film method as well as processes using three separate images. Exposure of lenticular films requires a perfect system of objectives with uniform optical filter position. Entirely new types of negative emulsions of high resolving power were devised to overcome irradiation effects. — Methods of printing lenticular films are described. Objectives of small aperture were developed to offset color fringing resulting when large-aperture objectives were used. The three separation images are registered by a mirror system. — New arc lamps of very high efficiency are described for use in projection. They operate with horizontally arranged square carbons and magnetic stabilization. The luminous gas portion extends in front of the positive carbon and can radiate laterally without obstruction. With 60 amperes the intrinsic brilliance in the crater was found to be 800 candles per sq. mm. — A further increase of screen brightness was realized by the use of a special projection screen which confined the reflected light within the needed angle. Metal sheets are used into which one million small concave mirrors are rolled per square meter. On the basis of conditions prevailing in the German theaters, an increase of screen brightness by a factor of 3 can be attained with the use of the new screen."
"Although first work in magnetic sound recording occurred probably as far back as 1900, it has been only recently that any considerable interest has been aroused in it. The present paper describes the principles underlying the methods of recording and reproducing by magnetic means, both by longitudinal and perpendicular magnetization, and a steel tape machine used in European broadcasting stations is illustrated. The advantages of the magnetic systems of recording over other systems are outlined."
"A description is given of the theory and performance of the television system based upon the Iconoscope and Kinescope. The cathode-ray transmitting and receiving tubes used in the system are discussed in detail, considering not only the physical principles involved but also the operating characteristics. — In conclusion, an account is presented of the television project at the Empire State Building (New York), describing the terminal equipment and giving examples of the 441-line picture that can be transmitted and received."
"During the Conventions of the Society, symposiums on new motion picture apparatus are held, in which various manufacturers of equipment describe and demonstrate their new products and developments. Some of this equipment is described in the following pages; the remainder will be published in subsequent issues of the Journal."
"Some recent developments in acoustics, especially in Germany, Russia, and in the author's laboratory, are reviewed. Experiments by E. Meyer, of Berlin, help to clarify the differences between geometrical and diffuse reflections of sound in rooms, and reveal the nature of some of the errors inherent in reverberation measurements. Meyer also describes special absorbent materials, as thin wood panelling or stretched oilcloth, which are selectively absorbent for low frequencies. S. Rschevkin, of Moscow, describes a method for prolonging, diminishing, or otherwise modifying the reverberation in a room by means of Helmholtz resonators. — A new electroäcoustical device for the artificial production of vowels, by K. W. Wagner, of Berlin, is capable of generating typical German vowels that can not be distinguished from the originals. The oscillogram and sound spectrum of the artificial vowel resemble more closely the oscillogram and sound spectrum of the original vowel than do two sets of oscillograms and sound spectra of the same vowel “picked up” at two different microphone positions in the same room. The experiments reveal the nature of sound distortion caused by reflections from the boundaries of a room, and show that the ear tolerates considerable distortion. — The paper concludes with a review of some recent work undertaken by the writer, including resonance in rooms, the acoustical design of broadcasting studios, and vistas in musical acoustics."
"A survey of the history of monopack or multilayer photographic color processes, including the methods of greatest importance at the present time: (a) silver dye-bleaching methods and (b) silver dye-coupling methods. Silver dye-coupling methods appear to be most promising, and have been successfully applied to monopack films according to two distinct principles. — In one method, color-forming compounds are added to the developing solutions. Color separation in this method depends upon control of the speed at which bleaching solutions penetrate superposed emulsion layers. In the second method, employed in the new Agfacolor process, the different color-forming substances, instead of being added to the developing solution, are incorporated in emulsions coated in superposition so that three differently colored images are simultaneously formed in a single development. The metallic silver is subsequently removed by solvents leaving only pure dye images. — The process is based upon the pioneer work on color-forming methods of R. Fischer who, before the World War, developed the process substantially as it is now being used. The contributions to improving this process are the perfection of dyestuff-coupling components better than those available to Fischer, improved methods of preventing diffusion of the color-forming compounds, and methods of precisely controlling the manufacture of multilayer film upon a large scale."
"The photographic recording of sound is accomplished by modulating a narrow beam of light and projecting it upon a strip of moving film. There are three ways in which the amount of exposing light may be varied. A light-beam of fixed dimensions may have its intensity varied; a beam of constant intensity and length may have its width varied; or a beam of constant intensity and width may have its length varied. The first two types of modulation produce variable-density soundtracks, while the third type produces variable-width tracks. — The recording optical system can be made to modulate either the intensity or the length of the light-beam. The unit consists essentially of an incandescent lamp to produce the light, a system of lenses to direct the light, an aperture and slit to limit the light, and a reflecting mirror galvanometer to modulate the light. A magnetic shutter for ground-noise reduction is also part of the standard variable-width recording unit. A system of mirrors and lenses intercepts a small portion of the recording light and projects it upon an external card. This system magnifies the deflection of the galvanometer and shutter to such extent that the degree of modulation and the zero settings can be observed easily by the unaided eye. — Many different types of sound-track can be made with the recording optical system without sacrificing any of its advantages as a light modulator. By the use of the appropriate condenser and aperture assembly, the system will record standard bilateral variable-width track, standard variable-density track, push-pull class B variable-width track, push-pull class A variable-density track, and push-pull class A variable-width track. The manner in which each of these systems functions is shown and described in detail."
"The possibility of reproducing sound directly from the negative record offers an improvement in sound quality because it avoids the deterioration of definition, wave-shape, and volume range caused by the printing process. — In order to eliminate the distortion inherent in variable-density sound negatives, the playback amplifier must produce the same type of compensating distortion that occurs in good straight-line prints. The theoretical circuit requirements for an amplifier of this type are derived, and the RA-222 negative playback amplifier developed by the ERPI engineering department, in accordance with these requirements, is described. In addition to the basic distortion circuit, the RA-222 amplifier satisfies practical requirements, such as self-contained power supply and adjustments for negative gamma, amplitude, and frequency characteristic. — Experiences in various fields of use are reported, such as sensitometric measurements, print control, re-recording, and high-quality reproduction."
"The sound-track cutter requires a film reproducer in his daily routine work: a reproducer that can be threaded quickly and will not tear or damage the film, and will produce sound quality of sufficient excellence to judge splits or cut-outs in music recording. — Such a device has recently been developed, and its mechanical details and operation are described. By means of a geared motor drive and a series of friction rollers, the sound-track is fed past the light-beam of the reproducing system at standard speed, with a reversible feature that is automatic and instantaneous. No sprockets or clamp rollers are used, and the work of the cutter is speeded materially through its use."
"Preparation of sound effects, music, and dialog tracks for dubbing requires accurate synchronization of each sound with the corresponding action. This is ordinarily accomplished by a preliminary step in which the synchronism of one sound-track at a time is checked against the action in a moviola, in which the picture is seen through a small viewing lens. — The image being small, the accuracy with which synchronism may be checked is not good. Hence this is followed by a final step, in which the synchronism of all tracks is checked during rehearsals in the dubbing-room proper. Owing to the ponderous character of the dubbing machinery the latter process is quite slow and laborious. This paper describes the form and use of a machine that permits accurate synchronism of the various sound-tracks with the corresponding action, but with all the mechanical freedom of the usual moviola. — The machine will accommodate six sound-tracks, with provision for controlling the output level from each, and may be instantly started, stopped, or reversed. The mechanical design facilitates threading and easy displacement of any sound-track by a known amount to bring it into synchronism. The action is projected upon a screen 4 1/2 × 4 feet in size, which enables accurate observation of the degree of synchronism attained."
"Special-effects cinematography furnishes a means of filming scenes that can not be filmed easily, safely, or economically by conventional methods. Various kinds of special-effects camera work are described, including multiple exposure, multiple printing, travelling-matte systems of printing and photography, the projection background process, optical printing, and miniatures. The fundamentals of the processes are outlined, and the relations of the special-effects department to the studio organization are discussed."
"A review of recent developments in 16-mm. sound, including technical advancements and perfections contributing to raising the standards of illumination and quality, and a discussion of the extent to which the limits of picture size and audience have been raised for large-audience performances. — Adoption of the 16-mm. sound-film for education is discussed. Its function as a medium of instruction for general education of an extra-curricular nature and its use in the classroom as a corollary to text-book and oral instruction are treated. — The relation between the 35-mm. and 16-mm. branches of the industry is discussed. What is the legitimate domain of 16-mm.? Limitation of both types of film, the most effective fields for each, and the encroachment of 16-mm. upon the entertainment field are brought out, and the possible effect upon the general trend of type of entertainment pictures is indicated."
"During the Conventions of the Society, symposiums on new motion picture apparatus and materials are held, in which various manufacturers of equipment describe and demonstrate their new products and developments. Some of this equipment is described in the following pages; the remainder will be published in subsequent issues of the Journal."
"The editors present for convenient reference a list of articles dealing with subjects cognate to motion picture engineering published in a number of selected journals. Photostatic copies may be obtained from the Library of Congress, Washington, D. C., or from the New York Public Library, New York, N. Y. Micro copies of articles in those magazines that are available may be obtained from the Library of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C."

"The much discussed problem of the influence of oil oxidation on the electrical properties of impregnated paper is studied in an article by J.B. Whitehead and T. B. Jones(1). Accelerated oxidation tests have been made on one insulatin~ oil with oxygen introduced over the range of 0.013 to 10.4% by volume. Tests were also .made on wood pulp paper impregnated with oxidized oil. The outstanding conclusion of the work is the relative unimportance of small amounts of oxygen as a cause of change of electrical properties. It is rather that during the process of continued oxidation of oil in contact with free oxygen transitory reaction products are formed which give cause to increased liquid or gaseous ionization under electrical stress than that the oil is permanently deteriorated by the influence of small amounts of oxygen. It the contact with free oxygen is broken, small amounts of oxygen either combine or go into solution without serious impairment of the electrical properties of the oil."
"During the period from June 1937 to July 1938, the literature on insulating papers is concerned principally with problems pertaining to the performance of high voltage paper insulated cables. Two books of interest have appeared, one by Paul Boning(15) containing a discussion of the influence of adsorbed ions on the inner surface of cellulose and other materials, and the second by R. Vieweg.(16) Two useful bibliographies have appeared, one by H. F. Lewis,(17) prepared under the auspices of The Committee on Cellulose and Allied Substances Division of Chemistry and Chemical Technology, National Research, Council, containing 475 references, and the second by Dr. J.B. Whitehead,(18) dealing particularly with high voltage cable insulation and containing 84 references."
"During the past year, there has been no spectacular development in general rubber technology, but there has been steady progress in the use of fillers, accelerators, etc. This will, of course, be reflected in better rubber electrical insulation, but the improvement has been of degree rather than of kind."
"The year's progress on improvement of transformer oils may be considered as negligible, if judged by published information. The demand for improvement is so slight as to furnish little stimulus for advances in manufacture. It may be considered, therefore, that present mineral transformer oils are, in large part, quite satisfactory as to service performance."
"The October 1938 issue of Modern Plastics is again the most complete yearly review of developments. Physical, chemical and electrical properties of all types of commercial resins are compared."
"The importance of the relation of physical and chemical behavior to the molecular structure of simple and complex substances is becoming more fully recognized in the solution of theoretical and practical problems arising in academic and industrial laboratories. The knowledge of this relation is of special value to the field of electrical insulation in which the selection and use of materials possessing the proper resistance to electrical end mechanical stresses are subject to more exacting specifications than were previously required. The physicist and chemist have devised and developed a number of sensitive methods for obtaining such structural information. Among these methods are the dielectric and conductivity studies which have materially aided in the search for information concerning the structure and properties of various substances. This is attested by numerous and varied researches reported in the literature during the past year."
"This standard relates only to relays of types directly associated with power switchgear. It does not cover relays of types designed primarily for industrial control, excitation or governor regulating, telephone, telegraph, traffic signal, or similar purpose."
